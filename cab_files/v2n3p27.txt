DESIGN FOR NEW <building>UPPER CANADA COLLEGE, TORONTO</building>.—



MR. <person>GEO. F. DURAND</person>, ARCHITECT, LONDON, ONT.



'	THE sum of $130,000 has been appropriated by the Legislature for the erection of this building, which is designed to accommodate from 250 to 300 boarding students, and in addition, the :requisite teaching staff and servants. The fronts are to be constructed of Credit Valley sandstone, in random course rock-face work, to the height of the basement—six feet—and red pressed brick above the plinth course, with terra cotta panels and string courses, the openings to be trimmed with rock-face red sandstone. The main entrance arcade is to be built of sandstone to the height of the first floor (25 feet), and is sparingly carved and ornamented, the columns of the arches being of polished red New Brunswick granite. The roofs are to be covered with slate throughout (there being no deck or flat portions), are of steep pitch, sub-divided by the dormer windows, lighting the attic, the sky line being varied by the use of gables and the grouping of the chimneys. The four main staircases are each

eight feet wide in the clear, are easy of access from any portion of the building, and are enclosed between brick walls as a preventive to the rapid spreading of fire. The heating is to be by low pressure gravity steam, supplied by two boilers of wrought steel. The class rooms are heated by indirect radiators, with fresh air supply; these are placed under the windows, the vitiated air being removed through registers on the opposite side of the rooms leading into ducts connected with two large exhaust shafts, which are continually heated, and are over 80 feet high. The fresh, heated air is to be supplied at the rate of 200 cubic feet per minute to each occupant, at a velocity not exceeding five feet per second. Mr. Geo. F. Durand London, Ont., is the architect.
