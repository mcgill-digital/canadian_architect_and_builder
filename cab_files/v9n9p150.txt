WATER PROOFING BRICK. <article title=" WATER PROOFING BRICK " author="">

EXPERIMENTS	made to ascertain the length of time that brick and sandstone are rendered water-proof, or protected, by oiling, show some valuable results. The oils used were linseed oil, boiled linseed, and the crude mineral oil known as ''blue oil," and the exposure was on a roof fairly exposed to the sun and weather, the bricks being goods sound, machine-made. It is stated that the amount of oil and water taken up by the sandstone was very much less than that absorbed by the bricks, although the area of the sandstone cubes was

much the greater. Equal amounts of the raw and boiled oils were absorbed ; the blue oil, however, was taken up in much greater quantity by both bricks and sandstone, but by the end of twelve months the whole of the thirteen and one-halt ounces of blue oil had apparently evaporated, and the bricks had returned to their original state, but those treated with raw and boiled oils were unchanged. Finally, it was seen that the sandstone cubes treated with raw and boiled oils returned to their original weights, but not appearing to have lost the good effects of the oils, being practically impervious.
