followed in practice. Thus, for the depth of floor foists, in inches, add 2 to half the span in feet. For trimming joists, add 8/1 in. in breadth for each joist supported by the trimmer. For common rafters, add 1 o the bearing, in feet, and take half the sum, for the depth in inches. For purlins, when the trusses are 10 ft. apart, add 3 to the depth of the common rafter, for the depth of the purlin, and make its breadth about three-fifths of its depth. For the tie-beam take one-third of the span in feet and add 2 to the depth in inches, making the breadth about half the depth. Make the depth of the principal two-thirds of the depth of the tie-beam, and its breadth about four-fifths of its depth. Rules of the kind quoted could not be formulated for

iron roofs, because the nature of the material requires closer accuracy in computing its section.

This building has been erected on the site of the old post office building, James street north, the old foundation walls being used to a great extent. The old part was faced with Amherst freestone, and this was all reused in the new front after being re-dressed.

The interior of the building has been finished in a very elaborate manner. The wood-work throughout is of quarter cut golden oak, supplied and erected by J. Hoodless & Son, of Hamilton.

The halls are finished in Numidian marble, with dado panels of Mexican onyx. The staircase is of Tennessee marble, with an ornamental dull brass railing, and the floors throughout are of marble mosaic.

The Forsyth Marble & Granite Co., of Montreal, were the contractors for the marble work.

<article title="Arts and Crafts Exhibition" author="">ARTS AND CRAFTS EXHIBITION.

The Ontario Society of Artists announce an exhibition of applied art to be held at their galleries 165 King st. west, Toronto, during the month of April, 1900.

This being the first exhibition of this nature to be held in Toronto, the committee of arrangements have deemed it advisable to make the following statement of the objects to be attained and to make

an appeal to intending exhibitors for a high standard of excellence in the work.

''As it is the intention to hold the exhibition in the art galleries the space will be limited, and accordingly exhibits are being solicited from Toronto designers and manufacturers only ; it is not to be a strict rule, however, that only Toronto exhibits shall be eligible.

"The scope of the exhibition will not be limited in any Way, merit of design and workmanship making any object eligible. All works exhibited shall have the name of the designer, and such workmen as contribute artistic value to them mentioned in the catalogue, together with manufacturers' and owners' names.

"The committee of arrangement will seek to Conduct the exhibition so that it will be an artistic success, and as this will be secured only by good work being shown they reserve the right for committees of selection to select from the work offered that which they deem of highest quality. The members of the committee of selection will be chosen with a view to obtaining the best judgment possible.

"All drawings should be framed, if ever so simply, and in cases where the executed work is of such nature that it would be impossible to exhibit it, the design may be accompanied by a photograph ; unexecuted designs may also be exhibited.

"Designers have entire freedom as to the form in which they may show designs, either by drawings, models or the actual works, but it is expected that some notion of the completed article or thing will be given, and not merely working drawings, which, useful and appropriate in their place, are unsuitable in an exhibition."

All communications regarding this exhibition should be addressed to Mr. Robt. F. Gagen, secretary, 90 Yonge street, Toronto.
