<article title=" CANADIAN BUILDING STONES AT THE WORLD'S

FAIR." author="">CANADIAN BUILDING STONES AT THE WORLD'S

FAIR.

A PROMINENT and interesting feature of the admirable collection of Canadian minerals shown at the World's Fair, was the variety of specimens of building stones from the several provinces of the Dominion. These specimens were collected by the Dominion Government Survey at Ottawa, and by the Ontario Government Mining Bureau. Toronto. and from these sources we have obtained the particulars hereinafter printed in regard to them

In material of this description. Ontario particularly rich. Many excellent varieties of limestone. freestone and sandstone occur. The first named yields an excellent quality of quicklime. The Guelph dolomites are well adapted for building purposes. The hard, close grained, Kingston limestone is quarried fruits beds varying in thickness from six inches to a foot, and although of a dark grey color when fresh, it bleaches to an agreeable whitish hue in the course of a few years.

At many places the crystalline limestone is fine enough to work as marble. At Dorion in Thunder Bay District, it is of a flesh color, variegated with veins. Elsewhere in the same district is found an argillaceous limestone of a milk white, branded with pale grey, and of a rich brown and pale green (mottled), known as Penessie Marble. Another variety called 'Serpentine Marble,' possesses good colors, but does not take a high polish. Renfrew County yields the largest quantity of marble for commercial purposes.

Good marble, black, white and pink is found at Madoc in the County of Hastings. and Barrie township in Frontenac County.

At Cornwall. on the River St. Lawrence, a fairly good quality of black "marble" is being worked, Extensive deposits of Medina sandstone are worked at the Forks of the River Credit in the County of Peel,

Several points along the north shore of Lake Superior yield sandstone of the very best quality.

Good granite, rich in color and free from flaws, is found in many places; West of Fort William it occurs of a brownish grey in souse localities, elsewhere it inclines to a pale purple. Near the City of Kingston the color strongly resembles that of Peterhead granite, but is a brighter red,

Black Syenites are found along the north shore of Lake Superior.

In addition to Ontario's exhibit, there were shown at Chicago some fine samples of sandstone of a fine grained nature by New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, North West Territories and British Columbia, together with a large collection of marbles and granites from various parts of the Dominion shown by the Geological Survey.

The following particulars of the character and variety of Canadian exhibits of building stones, the purposes for which they seem to be adapted. and the sources of supply, are expected to prove of much interest to architects, engineers, builders and others interested its knowing what native material in this line is obtainable.

<person>John Hyslop</person>. Goderich, Ont.—Six-inch cube of limestone, dressed— About thirty feet of this rock, in beds from three to six feet thick, is exposed in a cliff at Mr. Hyslop's quarry, and large blocks can be easily obtained. The stone makes good lime, but is chiefly used for building purposes. The piers of the Maitland bridge at Goderich, and the Goderich Jail are built of

it.

Geological Survey—Six-inch cube limestone, dressed—From the quarry of Mr. White, Pembroke, Out. The beds are from three to twelve inches thick. The stone is largely employed in the town of Pembroke, and has been used to sonic extent for bridges, &c. An analysis of a specimen. similar to that exhibited, gave,—carbonate of time. 8396 carbonate of magnesia 929; carbonate of iron, 069; insoluble. fio6.

Geological Survey—Six-inch cube of limestone, dressed. From the quarry of Mr. <person>C. B. Wright</person>. These quarries have been extensively worked for a long time, the beds, which are almost horizontal, having been removed over a large area for a depth of fifteen feet, Blocks ten by five by three feet can be takes out, and are sold at from 251035 cents per cubic foot. Most of this stone is used for building purposes in the city of Ottawa. The upper portion of some of the beds presents a banded structure, the lower portions being finely granular. The stone is easily dressed and susceptible of bright polish and sharp tooling.

Geological Survey.—Six-inch cubes of grey and white limestone, dressed— From an extensive band of crystalline limestone at Portage du tort, Lichfield, Que. The beds, which vary in thickness, are sometimes grey in color, alternating with others which are al most pure white. The stone takes a good polish and weathers evenly.

Supi., Nanaimo B. C—Six-inch cube of sandstone, dressed.—From quarries on Newcastle Island, B. C. Among the coal-bearing rocks on Newcastle Island there are beds of brownish-grey sandstone, which afford excellent material for building and flagging stones, The upper beth are of the best quality, and it was from one of these that Mr. <person>E. E. Emery</person>. of San Francisco, obtained the stone for the construction of portions of the ituint in that city. Blocks for pillars were taken out, which after dressing were twenty-seven feet six inches in length, and three feet ten inches in diameter Flagstones, with even surfaces, such as ten feet square, have also been obtained, and are easily quarried, and it is not likely that some of the measures will afford good grind-stones.

<firm>The Chicago and Verte Island Stone Co</firm>. of Chicago, U. 5. A—Six-inch cube of sandstone, dressed—From quarries on Verte Island, Nipigon Bay, Lake Superior, Out. This stone is known to have a thickness of thirty feet, The upper bed alone is twenty feet thick Mr. <person>George. P. Merrill</person>, of the United States Geological Survey, recently made a microscopic examination of it, and found it to be composed of quartz and feispar with a very little mica. The crushing strength is reported to he 11, 500 lbs. to the square inch. Thus far it has been used principally in the United States,

<firm>Credit Forks Stone Co</firm>., Credit Forks, Ont.—Six-inch cube of sandstone, dressed.—From quarries at Caledon, Ont.

The beds have been stripped over an area of four acres and the stone removed to a depth of fifteen. feet,

Six-inch cube of sandstone, dressed—Froisi Skead's quarry, about four miles from Ottawa. The stone is very fine grained. of a brownish grey colour, and would make handsome buildings. It appears, however, to be difficult to quarry, the blocks obtained being of very irregular form, owing to somewhat conchoidal fracture, A dressed specimen, about seven feet long, may be seen in the coping of die wall round the grounds of the Parliament Buildings at Ottawa, but it can only be distinguished front the adjoining blocks of Ohio stone by its finer texture.

Six-inch cube of sandstone. dressed.—from Mr. <person>John Rankin's</person> quarry. near Pembroke. Out. The stone occurs in beds from six to twenty itches thick, It is easily worked, and although soft, is tough and retains sharp angles. The Pembroke court house is built of it, and it is sometimes employed for making monuments.

The beils are horizontal, and for tile first fifteen feet from the surface vary in thickness from four inches thick to two feet ; below this there is a massive lied, which according to Mr. Heustis, is front three to eight feet thick. It is divided into rectangular masses by joints from six to fourteen feet apart, which greatly facilitate the quarrying. The price of this stone delivered on board vessel, in the harbor is from forty to sixty cents per cubic foot, Blocks continuing 160 cubic feet base been shipped. The quarry is held by a stock joint company,
