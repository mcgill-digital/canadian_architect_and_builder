and if we had such tests of known good material we could from them make calculations of what to allow for the class of material we are using. But whatever is done should, I think, be done in a thorough and scientific way.

Mr. Aylsworth It has occurred to me that as we could not at once make all the tests that would be required, would not it be well just to test the common lumber we get in lumber yards for ordinary use, and give us that result to begin with? This school is established to do its work not in one or ten years, but a good

length of time mnst be given. If sufficient money could be obtained to test at first the commonest timber that we get in lumber yards, atter that we could have trees specially taken out and tested more scientifically. We can only hope to get a great work of this kind done a little at a time, but in the course of time results will be arrived at that will be very valuable.
