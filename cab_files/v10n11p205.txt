to save manual labor, are the causes to which the London Builder attributes the practically universal abandonment in America of the open fire place, as a warmth producer and distributor. While maintaining that the European method is scientifically correct, our Contemporary is nevertheless led to admit that " Even in England, the efficiency of the open fire is limited and its costliness considerable ; therefore we may with advantage take cognizance of the results and the experimental efforts of our inventive rivals." That this opinion is making rapid headway in Europe is proven by the increased demand for Canadian heating appliances—the growth of which demand has led to the establishing of agencies for the goods in all the leading cities of Great Britain and the continent.

To those, however, who have given the subject proper consideration, it is easily apparent that the architect is in no danger of being supplanted by the engineer.

On the other hand, there is a possibility that the architect may be called on to advise and assist the engineer to so design his structures as that they shall present a pleasing and artistic appearance. A recent article in the Engineering Record, pointing to the necessity of the aesthetic element in the design of engineering structures, says : "To design work of this character, it is true, involves the exercise of powers acquired through a somewhat broader training than engineers usually enjoy at this time, and that fact indicates two proceed
