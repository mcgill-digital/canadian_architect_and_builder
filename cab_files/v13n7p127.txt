A number of new companies are being

<article title="The Manufacture of Portland Cement" author="">The Manufacture of

Portland Cement,	organized in Ontario to manufacture Portland cement. Investigation has



shown that an abundant supply of the raw materials necessary for the purpose is to he found in various localities. Upwards of half the cement at present used in Canada, amounting to perhaps a quarter of a million barrels, is imported from Europe, so that there is room for a considerable expansion of the native industry. Care should be taken however not to increase too rapidly our manufacturing capacity lest we find ourselves in the position of producing more than we can find a profitable market for. This has been the experience in many lines of industry. As soon as it became apparent that money was being made by the pioneer manufacturers in a certain line, others crowded in to such an extent that soon there was overproduction and little or no return to those who had embarked their capital. Then followed trusts for the purpose of limiting the output and maintaining prices.





<article title="Ancient Lights" author="">SEVERAL ably written papers have recently been presented and fully discussed before the Royal Institute of

British Architects, showing the unjust bearing of the English law relating to ancient lights. It was pointed out that the strict rights of light given by the Prescription Act are often very injurious to the development of towns, and as matters now stand an unscrupulous person has an opportunity of preventing his neighbor from using his property to the best advantage, except by payment of large compensation, and the law affords no means other than by mutual agreement to alter

Ancient Lights.
