On December 19th last, a British jury without leaving the box, decided that the 

<firm>Taff Vale Railway Company</firm> were entitled to damages against the 

<assoc>Amalgamed Society of Railway Servants</assoc> for losses sustained by reason of the action of members of the society in connection with the strike of the company's employees in 1900. This decision makes trade organizations legally responsible for damages arising out of the conduct of their members. The next step should be to compel the incorporation of such organizations so that their funds would be liable for payment of damages for which they might be held by the courts to be justly liable.
