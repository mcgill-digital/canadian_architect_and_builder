<article title="An Arch Collapses" author="">AN ARCH COLLAPSES.

A FEW days ago the big brick arch forming the portal of the Toronto, Hamilton and Buffalo tunnel tinder Hunter street, Hamilton, fell with a crash, fortunately without injuring anyone. The chamber, or support, of the eastern half of the arch had been removed. The sides were not strong enough to stand the strain, and bulged out, and the unsupported part of the arch fell. The accident was also partly due to the sand in the cement not being strong enough. About 40,000 bricks had been used in the arch, all of which will have to be removed. The loss will fall upon Mr. <person>Onderdonk, </person>the contractor for the tunnel.
