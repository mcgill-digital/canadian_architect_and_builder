In spite of the numerous strikes which have occurred in the building trades, some of which are yet unsettled, the value of new buildings in Toronto for the first half of the present year is about three quarters of a million dollars in advance of the same period of 1901. Nearly half of the increase is attributed to the new hotel and Exhibition buildings, t he remainder being principally on account of new residences, of which an unusually large number are in course of construction. A great improvement is noticeable in the new residence work both in point of design, materials, and workmanship. A large proportion of the new houses are being built for the use of the owners being specially designed and

superintended by architects A considerable amount of speculative building is being done in localities where land may be obtained at a moderate price, but even this work is designed by architects, and is not in the same class with the shoddy productions of speculative builders of ten years ago.

It is gratifying to learn that in Montreal, where building operations have been conducted on a somewhat restricted scale for two or three years past, a revival of enterprise in this direction has set in, while the cities and towns throughout the entire country are likewise witnessing improvements on a scale in keeping with the commercial prosperity now prevailing

It is to be regretted that workmen and employers cannot unite in an endeavor to make the most of the present favorable conditions, which cannot be expected to continue indefinitely The numerous strikes to which reference has been made will, if continued, prove the precursor of another period of commercial depression, tempting as they do to render capital timid. We are pleased to note the general condemnation of the <assoc>Plumbers' Union of Toronto </assoc>for having violated their agreement with the Master Plumbers. If there does not exist a sufficient sense of honor on the part of the Unions to live up to the terms of a definite agreement such as the one in question, there is small hope that satisfactory relations can in future be maintained between contractors and workmen in the building trades.
