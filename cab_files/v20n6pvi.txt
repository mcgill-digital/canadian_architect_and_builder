THE COST-PLUS-A-FIXED-SUM CONTRACT



EXEMPLIFIED IN





SPEED, ECONOMY AND HIGH-CLASS WORKMANSHIP









































The above picture shows the new works recently constructed of concrete for the Canadian General Electric Company, at Peterberough, Ont. This building from the ground up, as shown, represents thirty four working days of concreting. The result furnishes an object lesson for speed, economy and excellence of workmanship heretofore unattained in Canada.



We invite investigation of our methods and records by owners, architects and engineers.
