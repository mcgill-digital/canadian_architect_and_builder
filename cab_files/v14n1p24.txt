PLUMBING IN TORONTO.



FROM the report of the Health Department of Toronto, it is learned than the character of the plumbing in that city has vastly improved within the last three or four years During the period of speculative building an enormous amount of plumbing work was done. Since then the adoption of a plumbing by-law which provides that all plumbing and house drains must be inspected and certified to by the city's inspectors, has led to a large part of this defective work being done over again and made to conform to the proper sanitary requirements.





Colour is to the vision what sound is to the ear but like sound, it should be properly understood and well harmonized so as to produce as pleasurable sensations for the eve as the notes of a great musician produce for the car.





Canadian Industries and Canadian Products are taking the lead the world over. Why

should not Canadian Varnish do so at home ? When making out the

specifications for your next building, remember that
