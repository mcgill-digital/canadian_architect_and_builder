<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



this material is under that of more usual materials. An experiment in terra cotta is being tried at the new <building>Linton Apartments</building>, the lower storeys of which are faced with large blocks of yellow material, the surface of which is speckled gray, perhaps with the idea of making it a little like stone. Many of these blocks have cracked and require replacing, a circumstance which is not reassuring, but perhaps it is too early to judge of the case. The entrance hall of the <firm>McGill Students' Union Building </firm>is lined with pale buff terra cotta made in England. The colour is agreeable and the modelling of moldings and ornament is well done. Artificial stones have been used occasionally, as at the New Sherbrooke, and in a number of small houses, but they cannot be said to have established themselves in common use. For wall-linings of moderate cost chestnut wood is having some vogue.

The year has been happily free from serious labour troubles. Wages have, on the whole, made little change, with the exception of labourers' wages, which have advanced. The present wage rate is as follows:

Ordinary labourers	20c

Builders' labourers	20-22½c

Roof labourers	22½c

Masons	35c

Stonecutters	36-40c

Bricklayers—union wage 45c, actual rate	50c

Roof metal workers	30c

Plumbers	35c

Carpenters—25 to 30c, but generally	271/2c

Plasterers	33½-40c

Painters	25-27½c

Labourers working for the city are paid *1.75 per day; carters with single team, $2.50, with double team, *4.00.

At the banquet of the Builders' Exchange the Hon. <person>W. A. Weir </person>spoke on the need of better facilities for technical education in Montreal. Anything that may be done to this end must be very welcome to all interested in good handiwork. It is to be hoped the matter will not be allowed to drop, but will be discussed thoroughly and by all concerned, so that it may be put on a broad basis. The ordinary routine of technical education will probably never bc adequately taught in a school. Nothing can replace a thorough apprenticeship to a trade for teaching that trade thoroughly to the body of its workers. But no high standard of general excellence can be attained unless the more capable minds amongst the workmen have the opportunities for studying and practising something above the level of everyday experience. This it is that can be provided in a technical school. There should he centres where those of keener and broader mind than their fellows can resort to train themselves and fo see what there is to aim at and if possible surpass.

The members of the club met at the Beaver Hall Square rooms, on the evening of the 2lst November to listen to Mr. <person>Philip Lahee </person>on the Business of Electric Installation. The lecturer had, however, been suddenly called out of town, and in his absence the lantern was brought into play and a series of slides showing Greek sculpture, lent by McGill University, was exhibited and discussed by the meeting.

The annual dinner of the club was held in the "Oxford" on the evening of the 28th November. The guests were: Mr. <person>Chausse, </person>President of the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc>; Prof. <person>Nobbs</person>, and Mr. <person>William Maxwell</person>. Mr. <person>Chausse</person> conveyed to the club the good wishes and assurance of the keen interest of the Provincial Association. Prof. Nobbs. responding to the toast of "the guests said he had just returned from a short visit to New York, where he had made a special point of enquiring into the aims and methods of the <assoc>American Society of Beaux Arts Architects</assoc>, with a view to ascertain

ing whether it would be advisable that the Sketching Club should seek affiliation and co-operation with that body. He had been deeply impressed with the clearness of purpose and thoroughness of method of the Beaux Arts Society. It had accomplished a great work and bade fair to become the great training field of American architects. One point, however, he felt bound to criticize, and that was the limited view it took of architecture, a fault it had in common with the Ecole des Beaux Arts of Paris, In this 'view the whole labor and accomplishment, the whole glory and delight, of our mediaeval predecessors is a past phase of life which has taught us nothing. To shut our eyes to an art which transformed its buildings into organisms full of all the charms of craftsmanship, and throbbing with human interest, for the sake of a studied formalism, however dignified and refined, was in Prof. Nobbs' opinion a mistake so radical that he thought the Sketch Club should rather keep to its own pleasant bypath than share such an arid highway. Whilst the nations of Europe are each awakening to new life in architecture, along lines characteristic of each, and each with a distinct note of individuality, there is a tendency in the United States to harden up into rigid forms and academic rules. It would be better, Prof. Nobbs thought, to take inspiration from our own national traditions, give our individuality a chance to express itself. He was preparing to read before the Ontario Society of Architects a paper which was to deal with this subject of our national traditions, and hoped he would have an opportunity of saying something further on the subject to the Sketching Club also.

A very enjoyable evening brought out much musical talent in the club.

On the 5th of December members met at the club rooms and worked on the second of the series of design subjects for the season. Seven sets of designs were sent in in competition for the first of the series. The new subjects were, in Class A, a shelter to the access stairs of a city subway; and in Class B, a simple mediaeval tower in the centre of a marketplace.
