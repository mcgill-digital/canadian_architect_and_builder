<building>Union League Club House, Chicago</building>

The competition for the Union League Club House is an instance of a successful competition. It was a limited

competition for which three well known firms were engaged, the losers to be paid $1000 each. As the proposed cost is $800,000 and the successful architect's fee $40,000, the expense fee, promised to unsuccessful competitors, is a bagatelle to the promoters, and secured them a good competition. If any building is of sufficient importance to make a competition worth while, it is worth while to spend some money in the competition. The conditions of competition are pub-

lished in the Inland Architect for January, along with the plans. There is no mention of a professional advisor for deciding the merits of the plans. Decision lay with the building committee of the Club. But considering what a city Chicago is for eminent architects and that they are probably all members of the Club, the building committee was most likely an unusual building committee. The competing architects had also an opportunity of appearing before the committee, before the final decision was made, to give a detailed explanation of their plans. This was also a good feature. The result secured is a wonderfully fine plan by <person>Mr. Burnham </person>which seems upon examination to justify without doubt the choice of the committee.



An interesting piece of work is being done at St. Louis, in preparation for the World's Fair. The Fair, which is

to be placed in Forest Park, where are many large trees, will require the removal of 700 trees ; but, both to preserve the trees and to have the advantage of their

shade for the Fair, they are to be transplanted so as to line the broad avenues which will remain as a feature of the park when the Fair is over. As the trees are from 12 to 18 inches in diameter, this is an undertaking of more than unusual difficulty, and it will not do to waste time in failure. It is in the method employed to insure success that the interest lies for us. The trees are to be lifted during the winter, while they are dormant and when the ground is frozen so that the earth in which the roots are set may be carried away bodily. There is a suggestion here for another way than the heart—breaking destruction that is sometimes found necessary when a fine tree stands in the wrong place on a building lot. If the transplanting project of the St. Louis Fair is successful, we who have so much more frost—whose trees must be if anything more dormant, or at any rate dormant longer, and who can be sure of removing a greater depth of frozen earth— ought to be able to move a large tree within a lot, or bring to the lot from elsewhere trees that it would take more than twenty years to grow.



A proposition was made at one of the weekly lunches of the Toronto Chapter of the Ontario Association of Architects, recently, that members of the Association should agree to adopt a uniform nomenclature when entitling the floor plans of a building. It was further proposed that the system adopted should be the American system of abandoning the use of the term ''ground floor," and calling the floor immediately above the street the first floor. There was some discussion on the reasonableness and simplicity of the American system, but it was
