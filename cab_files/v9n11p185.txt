where the water will rise to when the cistern is sufficiently full. It is also desirable to have a filter attached, in order that the water may be used for culinary purposes if desired. Filters may be attached in different ways They are sometimes fixed at the top where the water is let in, and sometimes they consist of partition walls, which divide the cisterns in two compartments, the water being let into one compartment and taken out of the other, holes being left at the bottom for the water to pass through the partition. Gravel, sand and charcoal, or marble chippings and charcoal, are employed to form the filter. These are filled in layers, to a height above the holes in the partition on the side in which the water is admitted. The partition should be plastered just the same as the walls of the cistern. Sometimes a single brick partition is left between the two compartments without cement on either side, and without holes at the bottom, but the joints must be laid in cement. The water is then left to percolate through the bricks as best it may. For a time this makes a splendid filter, but after a while the pores get filled up and as a filter it becomes comparatively useless. Another filter may be made by forming a small arched mound of brickwork about a foot high on the bottom of the cistern at the lowest part. The pump-pipe is cemented into the top of the hollow mound, and small holes are left around the bottom for the water to pass through. A circular brick wall is built around the mound, about three or four inches from it and about three or four courses high, and the space between the circular wall and the mound is filled with the filtering materials, which are put in layers. The first and last layers should be clean gravel, marble chips or spalls of other stones. The second layer of charcoal should be powdered and packed in solid. The whole of the cistern should be plastered before the filtering materials are put in place. When repairing a cistern when the cement is cracked, the cement should be cut away two or three inches from the defect, and the wall should be well wetted before the new cement is applied. The usual form of cisterns is cylindrical, and we annex a table giving contents of cisterns having that form, and of various dimensions. Cisterns having arched tops or scooped bottoms, one-third of the height of such arch or scoop should be added. The table is nearly correct and is easily understood, and will prove useful in preparing estimates for cisterns. For every foot in depth a cistern will contain

One gallon is required by law to contain eight pounds of pure water. To get nearly the exact contents of a cistern from the foregoing table, multiply the figure opposite the diameter by the depth in feet, and you have the number of gallons the cistern will hold, nearly. For example, take a cistern four feet diameter and six feet deep, then we have: 4 x 98 = 392 gallons; that is, a cistern four feet in diameter and six feet deep, will hold 392 gallons, nearly.

Warm Floors. <article title=" Warm Floors " author="">

ONE of the reasons why floors in frame buildings are cold, is because, when joists are placed in position, the spaces

between them at the walls are left without anything to prevent cold from the outer skin of the wall from getting at will between the ceiling and the floors. In all cases, the spaces between the joists or thc walls should be lathed, and a strong coat of well haired mortar applied before the ceilings are lathed. This precaution would make a house 15 or 20 per cent. warmer than where it is neglected. In lower floors this method of dealing with the spaces, or some similar one, should never be overlooked or cold feet will be the rule with those who are obliged to remain over them for any length of time in the winter. A good way to avoid cold in a lower floor if the joists rest on a stone foundation, is to " brick-fill " between joists to a level with the floors, making the "brick-filling" not less than four inches thick, having the bricks laid in good mortar and well '' flushed" up to the joists and made level with the top of the timbers. In brick or stone buildings, "brickfilling" is generally done on the lower floor, but often in the upper stories where the walls are left thinner by set-backs, the joists rest on the steps formed by the setback, and in many cases nothing is done to the wall between the joists, and the ceiling and floors are finished with nothing to prevent the cold penetrating through the thin walls to the spaces between the lath and the floor. Sometimes a careful workman will see that the brick walls between the joists are rendered with a heavy coat of mortar, which is very good in its way, and would be better if the furring ran down to the ledge or step, and the space lathed and plastered, but this is perhaps objectionable because of its forming places where mice or other vermin would find resting places. The better way is to brick-fill, leaving a hollow space between the wall and the filling, and rendering the filling on the room-side. If the projection of brickwork receiving the joists is not more than four inches, the brick-filling may overhang the walls an inch or so on the inside, so as to give a one-inch hollow space between the wall and the filling. As this projection would be between the joists it would be hidden from sight.



OF late years there have been introduced into Canadian homes a variety of heaters, including hot air, hot water,

combinations of hot air and hot water, and steam heating pure and simple. In fact, there is scarcely a village, hamlet, or "corner" in the whole country that cannot boast of a "heater" of some kind, and each kind has got its own friends and admirers, all of which is right, for when a man is satisfied with anything he possesses, we take it that it would be almost sinful to unseat his satisfaction. In speaking of heaters, we do not mean stoves, nor yet fireplaces, but of some central arrangement from which heat may be projected to rooms some distance from the one containing the apparatus in which the heat is generated. Of such is the steam heater, and while this may not be the best for ordinary dwelling houses, it has become so well understood, and during the past few years has made such a rapid advance in public favor, that it seems almost unnecessary to describe its superiority over other modes of heating for large buildings, such as stores, hotels, or other buildings of more than ordinary dimensions. While it has not
