<article title="Prevention of Rust in Steel Construction " author="">Prevention of Rust in Steel Construction	From recent experiments conducted by Prof. <person>Charles L. Norton </person>at the newly established Insurance Engineering Experiment Station in Boston, to determine means of preventing the corrosion of steel frames used in building construction, the following conclusions have been reached First: Neat Portland cement, even in thin layers, is an effective preventive of rusting. Second : Concretes, to be effective in preventing rust, must be dense and without voids or cracks. They should be mixed quite wet where applied to the metal. Third: The corrosion found in cinder concrete is mainly due to the iron oxide, or rust, in the cinders and not to the sulphur. Fourth: Cinder concrete, if free from voids and well rammed when wet, is about as effective as stone concrete in protecting steel. Fifth:

It is of the utmost importance that the steel be clean when bedded in concrete. Scraping, pickling, a sand blast and lime should be used, if necessary, to have the metal clean when built into a wall.



THE papers and discussions



The 0. A. A.	formed the principal feature of the annual convention of the

<assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>held in Toronto last week. The papers covered a wide range of subjects, from decoration to modern methods of steel and fireproof construction. They were ably treated by the authors and evoked lengthy discussions, in the course

of which much additional information was elicited. The unusually large attendance at the sessions indicates that a programme of this character commands the attention of members of the profession who cannot but feel that to stay away from the convention is to miss gaining information of great value in everyday practice. In the present number will be found papers by Mr. <person>Gustave Hahn </person>on "Color in Decoration," and by Mr. <person>E. C. Shankland</person>, C. E. , of Chicago, on "Modern Constructive Methods" with the accompanying discussions. In our February number will appear the remaining papers by <person>Prof. Shortt</person>, of Queen's University, on ''Architecture as a Social Art," and by Prof. <person>William L. Rice</person>, of Philadelphia, on "Design," with the discussions thereupon.



<article title="Cement Production and Demand" author="">A recent article in The Monetary 

	Cement Production	Times declared

	and Demand.		that the

production of Portland cement

in Canada next year would largely exceed the demands of the market. The estimated production for the year was placed at $1,515,000 barrels, which we believe will be found to be an overstatement. While it may not be out of place to speak a word of caution to promoters of new cement manufacturing enterprises, our manufacturing facilities in this line are no more than sufficient, if indeed they are adequate to supply the demand in the Canadian market, which demand is rapidly growing. With the growth of population in
