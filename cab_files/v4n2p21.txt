<doctype type="text">February, 1891	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT BUILDER	21



<person>Mr. Gregg</person>, in responding, said he was like a certain builder, who said he felt very much better fitted for the scaffold than the public platform. (Laughter). The rising generation of architects owe a debt of gratitude to the old members of the profession. who have worked to raise the standard in Ontario. The benefits accruing from their labors will be largely felt by the architects in the years to come. We read in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, and heard in this Convention, with no slight feelings of terror and dread, that formidable list of subjects in which proficiency is required; but still we press onward. When we look at our titled seniors we think of the honors that await us and we say, as was said of old, that

Even Solomon in all his glory was not R. A. 'd like one of these." {Great laughter and applause). I am very sorry they changed that this afternoon, for I worked some weeks in the designing and construction of that joke. (Laughter). The object of our Sketch Club is to promote the interests of the profession, but we do this in an entirely informal manner. We combine architects and students; we have a variety in programs, combining art work, lectures, debates, etc. (Applause).

Mr. <person>C. H. Acton-Bond</person>, Secretary of the Sketch Club, thought such clubs should be established n all the chief centres, as great good is done to the younger members. The basis of membership is broad, including architects, draftsmen, decorators and artists—in fact, we take all who will come, and thus widen our sympathies as much as possible, and by mutual aid we learn a great deal more than by restriction. In regard to the examinations proposed, they seem to us entirely satisfactory in the general arrangement. We are all glad to see things as they are—that is the general sentiment among the younger members; and our Club will assist in furthering the aims of the Bill.

<person>Mr. Edwards</person>, proposed the toast of "The Press.' He told of a doctor who had boasted that with five cuts and a few stitches he could make a man so that his mother wouldn't know him (Laughter); and of the response of a newspaper man, Why, with one cut we can make a subject so that no body would know him.' (Laughter). But I am glad that that is not true of all the illustrations we have from our presses. All the instruction we have received in this Convention will be handed down to generations yet unborn; and we owe a debt of gratitude to those who so powerfully aid us in our objects.

<person>Mr. Mortimer</person>, of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, was exceedingly pleased at the progress the Association had made, and would have been more so if there had been present a representative or two from the <assoc>Quebec Association of Architects </assoc>recently formed. He trusted on some future occasion to witness an assemblage of the architects of the entire Dominion.

<person>Mr. Thos. Bengough </person>asked to be allowed the privilege of reading his response, which was as follows: A novice attending a meeting of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>would certainly learn a great deal both from what is said and also by observation, While the questions on the agenda deal with more or less technical subjects, still there is ample scope (by the use of the imagination), for excursions into other fields—at least into one-Bousfield. No Price was charged for admission to the meetings, which proved really interesting. The proceedings were enlivened by the performances of a skilled Harper, who discoursed sweet music. It is needless to say that under the voluptuous strains there were Billings and cooings and exclamations of Ough, Darling.' Of course these came from the <person>Galbraith</person>and were considered quite <person>Wright</person>, A Bowman and a F ler added to the entertainment by their skillful use of the long bow. They used King (William), who honored the company with his distinguished presence. Many members made vain efforts to Curry favor with His Majesty, by making their tongues Wag-ner the whole time, regardless of the Law. Even the presence of Balfour the oppressor did not check the flow of eloquence. Moore Power to your elbow " shouted the Irish members. All through the meeting a heavy Storm loomed up just in front of the assembly, but fortunately it did not break upon their heads. If any attempt had been made to Burke the discussion there would have been trouble. Allusion to the political elections, and reference to annexation and the Ras-trick to capture Canada, caused several to cry out, "What Aylsworth Kennedy's all right The presence of steady old apostles of the profession like Peters, Paull and Symonds was felt to be a restraining influence. The papers discussed were of great interest, and made much more so by the illustrations. For instance, <person>Mr. Burke</person>paper on Slow-burning Construction was beautifully embellished by the members at luncheon—at least those of them who happened to have cigarettes upon their persons. The advantages of Hot Water Heating" were clearly shown by <person>Harry Webb</person>, who cleverly managed, by the infusion of a few grains of mocha or Japan tea leaves, to make the experiment most interesting and enlivening. <person>Mr. Gordon</person>paper on " Building Materials was brought into undue importance at meal times, and it was shown that even what seemed to be most durable in the way of material was rapidly consumed and crumbled away. The exhaustion caused by the expenditure of gas in the Convention no doubt caused a good deal of the shrinkage in bulk. Whether or not such Burring material will stand the weathering of such a Storm as that which has been howling about us the past two days is no longer an open question. To Mr. <person>Gambier-Bousfield </person>is due the honor of illustrating in his own personality and nomenclature how a man can be the architect of his own fortune, and build unto himself a two-storey, double-decked, hyphenated edifice with mansard roof and attic; but, as shown by Mr. Gambier-Bousfield, the foundation of such a structure must be of good. solid English material, and the finishing in German-French. After the banquet the company dispersed in all directions, some to the Towns-end, while others walked <person>Langley</person> and lonely through the streets to the borders of the Lang to(w)n, and many had to bear the brunt of the Storm of <person>Winder</person>e they reached their homes. Possibly through the fault of the Smiths--or perhaps as the result of the banquet—it was found that one Kay would not Go-in-lock, and there were many loud Knox. This was found to be the case with those who lived on <person>Jarvis</person> street. When members were thus disappointed, they naturally thought of blue blazes, and would <person>Belcher</person> forth the name of <person>Gordon</person> and <person>Helliwell </person>though how these estimable gentlemen could be held responsible (having given only the ordinary certificate any more than any Torn, Dick or Harry—it is hard to say. Such an interpretation would make this altogether a too <person>Strickland</person>. Gentlemen, the Bond that cements you is one that includes every grade from the Denison of the rural settlement to the graduates of the Hall of learning; even a Miller and a Butcher have found a place, and join in the discussion of matters which are enGagen your attention. Let the Boult-bee well driven, and let there be all boon and no Bain (at least not more than you now have) and may all your sons— Wilson and Morri-son and Gib-son and Simp-son and Wick-son grow up in honor till they are known by their White-head. Gentlemen, with all these tempting viands before you, don't open your Gil-more than you should, else you will find Pils-worth more than par. Gentlemen, in this strain I must take up no Mor-time-r you will think I aspire to be a CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER. (Great applause and laughter.)

Mr. Smith proposed the health of the Chairman, which was drunk amidst applause.

President Storm, in acknowledging the honor, said he had at all times received the greatest kindness from the members of the Association individual

ally, and from the members of the Council, in all matters connected with the Association. He returned sincere thanks for this new expression of good will.

<person>Mr. Balfour </person>proposed the health of the Toronto members, which was drunk by non-residents. He said all the members he had spoken to had expressed the greatest confidence in the new Council, He trusted their expectations would be realized.

<person>Mr. Connolly </person>in responding, thought he could not do better than propose the toast of the Secretary," who had probably done more than any one present to advance the interests of the Association.

<person>Mr. Townsend </person>said that since its inception everything concerning the Association had been of the greatest interest to him, and he was proud to have had a hand in the work. He felt his election to the Council to-day was the greatest honor that could be conferred upon an architect in Canada. He trusted every one would do all in his power to make the organization a great success. (Applause).

<person>Mr. Kennedy </person>proposed a toast <person>to Mr. Curry</person>, who had at considerable self-sacrifice labored to forward professional interests.

Mr. Curry said he had only done what every man should do for his profession, and he was only too pleased that the architects had taken up the matter as they had, and that the Association was in the position it has reached to-day. The point reached thus far is only a part of the way. We are going to raise the profession to its proper standing ; and until it is raised to that standard we do not propose to cease. (Applause).

<person>Mr. Peters </person>sang The Friar of Orders Gray, and another song, Mr. <person>J. Ades Fowler</person>, accompanying him on the piano.

The meeting broke up about midnight.

A NEW REGISTRAR APPOINTED.

ATTENTION is directed to the advertisement in this paper announcing that Mr. <person>W. A. Langton </person>has been appointed Registrar of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, the position having been rendered vacant by the appointment of Mr. <person>S. H. Townsend </person>to the Council. All communications intended for the Registrar should therefore in future be addressed to Mr. Langton.





THE incandescent light supplied from a well-equipped central station and by means of an exclusively underground system of mains and service pipes, may be looked upon as one of the most artistic and beautiful developments of the industry. Especially is this the case in the more modern edifices where the interior wiring is entirely concealed and the architectural and decorative details are made to conform and adapt themselves to the perfect illuminant. The glow-lamp lends itself in a peculiarly successful manner to the production of novel and charming effects. Whether in brilliant combination with reflecting mirrors and cut glass, or modestly peeping forth from the heart of a cluster of flowers, natural or artificial, there is a charm in the softness and steadiness of the light that is all its own. While for a time perhaps the cheapness of its smoky and noxious competitor may be detrimental to its general introduction, it is a fact not to be disputed that the cultured and aesthetic taste of modem society is creating a demand for it that is more than keeping pace with the supply. The advantages of the low-tension system of distribution in connection with underground mains are many and obvious. The difficulties are, that in a large city the demand comes from so many quarters that they cannot be reached as quickly as desirable, and would-be good paying customers are for a time left out in the cold; but this is only a temporary evil. The multiplication of central sources of supply will remove the difficulty, and the admirers of the modern illuminant will have the satisfaction of a perfect service when their district is reached as a compensation and reward for the exercise of the needful Christian grace of patience. Those who are not in a position by reason of distance to avail themselves of the coveted light, have the satisfaction of knowing that when it does come along they will have the advantage of all recent improvements and modern ideas. There are some fixtures for drawing room use that are a perfect dream of beauty, and every day adds to the number and variety. The low-tension system, while not so far reaching in its earliest inception as some others, still has advantages by reason of the means at command for keeping a supply of electricity in the mains at all times and seasons, irrespective of the difficulties that are inseparable from central station operations, even with the most perfect and approved facilities
