Ground Plan,

<building>St. Joseph's Church, Bright, Northern England</building>

A "Flat-Iron" Church.



Built in 1879, on a gore similar to the "flat iron" gore. The tower and steeple stand at the narrow end of the site.  Illustration taken from the Builder of March 13th, 1880.

Taken from the other end the church gave the appearance of being larger than it actually was.



Collingwood, Ontario, September 8th, 1902
