<article title=" Quiet Lunch Rooms " author="">Quiet Lunch Rooms.

If there is one thing more than another that makes daily life in the city disagreeable it is the

necessity of lunching in the hot, crowded and noisy lunch rooms which alone are open to the ordinary business man. It is safe to predict that if any one will build a pleasant airy room, of size sufficient to keep people decently apart, with a kitchen properly cut off and ventilated, and properly' fitted up so that the frequenters will know, (as they will) that their food is cleanly prepared, he will command the trade and may demand his price, (within reason). An old shop, a hundred feet from front to rear is not good enough. One does not want to eat lunch by electric light, in a tunnel, at one end of which is a superheated and infraventilated kitchen that discharges, with every opening of the service doors, a steamy air to be stirred up by the fans which do not pretend to remove air but only to move it that it may take up a little more  moisture and make perspiration not quite so sensible. The hum of the fans, the scurry of attendants who have to go the whole length of this ill-planned apartment for every order, makes such a grounding of noise that conversation can only be carried on in loud tones, and as each one tries in self defence to raise his voice above his neighbour, the din,—for such it is, though one does not recognize it as such until on some occasion the fan stops and a hush seems to come over the room—the discomfort of it all makes lunch anything but the time for unbending and refreshment that it ought to be.

As a change from this one may go into a cellar that smells like the hold of a ship and occasionally find a

cockroach done to death at the bottom of one's savoury soup ; or one may sit in the kitchen itself.

Here is a legitimate field for architectural invention. The architect as an advertiser— -proffering his services with the implied but unproved assumption that they are better than his neighbour's is not in good repute; but the architect as the inventor, seeking occasion to produce what has not been produced before, is in a different position. This is the theoretical groundwork of the architectural competition the reason why, when there is a problem with new elements or occasion for invention, it is thought right that young men with new ideas should be given a chance to show what they' can do. And as it is time some new idea of the downtown restaurant was presented, the architect who can develope one and impress it upon the attention of some one who will carry it out will be welcomed in doing so by everybody.

There are many ways in which the problem can he agreeably solved. The problem of conveying supplies and the public to a roof garden is not too difficult or expensive for the occasion, and the utilization of the top storey in this way will be found money in many cases. But a more obvious utilization would he the insertion of a two-storey building in the waste space in the interior of a block. Here, with a mere entry on the street and a delivery at the kitchen door, might economically be erected a sky-lighted upper room upon a high and dry basement which would make an ideal restaurant high, quiet, clean and well ventilated depending for its attractions of appearance not upon the hideous splendour of the conventional restaurant but on constructive elegance and a roof that could be
