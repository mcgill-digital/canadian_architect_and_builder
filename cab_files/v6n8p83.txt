AMONG the other changes of climate incident to Canada which have taken place within recent years, is the growing frequency of wind storms, the severity of which in some instances should perhaps entitle them to be called cyclones. The wind force exerted on some occasions has been sufficient to carry away church spires, - and overturn buildings which were not firmly anchored to their foundations. These cyclonic storms should form a factor in architects' calculations in the future, otherwise we may expect to see the projections on many building if not the buildings themselves disappear.



We believe it would be the means of largely increasing the interest of the members in the Toronto Builders' Exchange if at stated intervals, especially throughout the winter, meetings of a social character were held. An interesting and instructive feature of the program at such meetings would be the reading of papers by members on various subjects connected with the building business, to be followed by discussion. There is without doubt the necessary talent available for this purpose, as well as to provide entertainment of other kinds. A never ending succession of business meetings is apt to become irksome unless relieved in some way by social gatherings such as we have suggested. We therefore hope to see action taken by the officers of the Exchange in the direction which has been indicated. THE Electric Wiremens' Union and the Bricklayers' Union,

of New York, are at present engaged in a dispute as to which class of workmen is entitled to cut the holes in a brick wall required to bring the electric wires into the building. On the Mutual Life Insurance Company's new building the wiremen had been doing this work themselves. The walking delegate of thc Bricklayers' Union notified the superintendent that the bricklayers would strike if the work given to them. When this came to the ears of the Wiremens' Union, the superintendent was advised that to hand the work over to the bricklayers would mean a strike of the wiremen. As the building was not being erected by contract, the superintendent wisely decided to cease operations and give the two unions the opportunity of fighting the dispute out between themselves. It will be of interest to learn the decision of the matter, and the method by which it was teached.



THE death is announced of Col. Auchmuty, founder of the New York Trade Schools. Col. Auchmuty, who was the possessor of an independent fortune, quitted some years ago the practice of his profession as an architect and set himself to establish an institution which would afford to the youth of America facilities for acquiring a practical knowledge of the various trades. Something was felt to be required to take the place of the apprenticeship system which was fast declining, and under which the trades unions permitted only a very limited number of apprentices to be employed. The trade school which Col. Auchmuty established met the requirements of young men anxious to learn trades, and the attendance rapidly increased until it became necessary to erect more extensive buildings designed to meet the special requirements. These buildings, erected by the students themselves, stand as an object lesson in proof of the thoroughness of the instruction imparted. The schools were from the outset bitterly opposed by the trades unions, but the endowments of $130,000 and half a million dollars given by Col. Auchmuty and Mr. J. Pierpont Morgan, respectively, have established them on a basis which will insure their future existence and usefulness.
