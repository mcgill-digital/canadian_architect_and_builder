NOTE.



Mr. Vincent Groom, of Llanrug, Wales, is said to have solved the problem of the disposal of thc refuse of slate quarries by perfecting a process by which, it is claimed, the waste can he made into solid blocks, capable of taking a highly-glazed surface in any number of colours. It is claimed that the new substance thus produced will stand a pressure of too tons to the inch— more than any natural stone—that it will be lighter in weight, and can be placed on the market at a cheaper rate than ordinary tiles.
