IN our legal column will be found the

<article title="The Toronto Municipal Buildings" author="">The Toronto

Municipal Buildings.	terms of the decision of Mr. Justice Street in the action brought by the city



of Toronto against the County of York, to determine the county's liability with respect to the cost of erecting, furnishing and maintaining the new municipal buildings at Toronto. The county contended that under their agreement with the city they were only liable for their proportion of the cost of the site and buildings, such cost being limited to $400,000. The decision of the Court, however, is that the county is also liable under the agreement for its proper share of the expense of heating, lighting and furnishing the court house.



<article title="Electrical Work" author="">IF report speaks truly there are many architects who know less than they should about electrical work. This is

especially true of some of the older men in the profession, who apparently have neglected to study and acquire a sufficient knowledge of the subject. We hear of specifications being prepared by wiring contractors instead of by the architect, and of specifications prepared by architects which are too indefinite in their terms to be of much value. Of course an architect who cannot prepare his own specifications is not capable of judging whether or not the work has been properly done, and as the number of incompetent contractors in this line is said to greatly exceed those who are skilful and honest, much bad work is being done. True an inspection is made by the underwriters, but the work is beyond the capacity of a single inspector to perform. It is therefore incumbent upon architects to thoroughly acquaint themselves with the

Electrical Work.
