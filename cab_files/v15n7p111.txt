'[he importance of careful reading of specifications by contractors when submitting tenders was emphasized in Toronto recently. A contractor tendered for certain painting and glazing work for one of the public schools, and was given the contract. He afterwards discovered that in looking over the specification he bad read ''class room" for "glass room," and in consequence was out more than one hundred dollars in his calculation of the amount of work to be done. He sued thc <assoc>Public School Board </assoc>to recover the amount, but the Judge held that he was put out of court by the contract.

A Canadian gentleman who has lived fourteen years in Chicago, told me the other day some interesting facts regarding the municipal government of that city. He states that with the exception of the parks and the boulevards which form part of the park area, no means are adopt d to clean the streets. The parks and boulevards are kept in perfect condition by the money and men provided by the county authorities and are much admired, while hr contrast the streets opening into the boulevards are disgracefully dirty. In the face of these conditions healthfulness of the city is said to be maintained by the winds which constantly sweep across it, induced by differences in temperature between the low-lying sandy soil on one side and the water of Lake Michigan on the other From this cause Chicago has been named the ''Windy City." Heretofore the City Government has been largely in the hands of the saloon keepers and appearances would indicate that the revenue from taxes has found its way into other than legitimate channels. The action of several wealthy young men

in offering themselves for election to the City Council is an augury of improved conditions for the future.
