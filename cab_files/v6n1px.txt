Another City changes its Plumbing Laws



—AND ADMITS THE—







Sanitas Traps without Back Venting

 ON Thursday, March 10th, 1892, a test of the leading Traps of the country was  made before a Committee of the Board of Health of the City of Rochester, N.Y., for the purpose of ascertaining their merits as anti-siphonic fixtures. The Traps tested were the S-Trap with the McClellan Vent, the Delehanty, the Sanitas, the Puro, the Bower and the Bennor traps. The first three traps were represented by their manufacturers. The last three were not so represented but were tested under precisely the same conditions. The Committee made its report to the Board of Health, March 21st, and the following is an extract from their report



TO THE BOARD OF HEALTH; — Your Committee begs leave to present to the Board the following report on the result of the test in relation to Trap Siphonage: The traps selected for the test were the BENNOR, the BOWER, the PURO, the common S-Trap with McClellan vent, the DELEHANTY and the SANITAS trap. These traps were all easily siphoned with the single exception of the SANITAS, which alone successfully resisted siphonage. In view, therefore, of the results of the experiments, your Committee respectfully recommends that Section 26 of the Rules and Regulations of the Board of Health of the City of Rochester,

 relating to Drainage and Plumbing, be revised to read as  follows: All traps shall be protected from Loss of Seal,

 through evaporation, siphonage or air-pressure.... The

SANITAS Traps may be used without venting. In case other

 Traps are used in connection with the fixtures above enumerated in this Section, they shall be connected with Vent pipes,

 in the manner hereinafter prescribed in these Regulations.





The above report and the revised rules were adopted by the Board of Health. The SANITAS is the only Trap allowed by the City of Rochester, without venting. As Architects in other cities are interested in saving their clients the needless expense and the dangerous complications of back venting, we invite their co-operation in getting





the Anti-Siphon Traps allowed in their respective cities, without venting.
