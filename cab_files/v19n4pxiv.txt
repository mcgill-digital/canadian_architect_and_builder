One of the distinctive features of the tall office buildings is that the top floors in most of them have architects for tenants. The reason for this is to be found in the superior facilities these upper rooms afford in the way of light for the draughtsmen to work by. They can keep on working by natural light for a long time after men in offices nearer the ground are doing their tasks by electric light, and this is always a great advantage to men doing this kind of drawing. More than one of these office buildings has its entire top story taken by one firm of architects alone.—The Building Manager and Owner.

It is claimed at Sault. Ste. Marie, Ont., that experiments have shown electric smelting to be a commercial success. Charcoal has also been used in place of coke, and it is believed that peat coke can also be successfully used. If this report shall prove all that is expected, it will mean a marked change in the iron industry in Canada. ----Improvement Bulletin.

For a period of eleven years in the principality of Lippe Detmold, exhaustive records were kept of all trees struck by lightning. These showed that trees standing near water seemed to be most likely to he hit, and gave this table of comparative danger: Oaks, 100 elms, 77 pines, 33 firs, 10; fir trees in general, 27; beeches, by far thc safest of all forest trees, 2. It is a well-known truth to old farmers in this country that oak trees are more frequently struck by lighting, and, therefore, are the most dangerous to seek refuge under. This is due to the fact that the oak has a deep root, which runs into the ground, while the beech has surface roots, scarcely covered by the soil.
