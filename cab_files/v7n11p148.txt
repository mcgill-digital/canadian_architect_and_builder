twelve inches thick. In fact this was done before the Institute of Architects at Albany.

The apparatus used consisted of two tunnels placed one on each side of the wall. The connections were made thoroughly tight so that no air could escape. The candle was placed close to one, and some one blew in at the other. The candle was extinguished through twelve inches of solid brick. This experiment confirms the fact that dampness will penetrate a solid brick wall.

I have often asked the residents in houses built with the hollow wall if it is ever damp enough on the inside to cause mildew or mould, or the swelling of the woodwork. This question has invariably been answered in the negative, thus proving the superiority of the hollow over the solid wall.

An example of this is seen in J. G. Clark's house in the city of Worcester, which had been closed and without fires for over a year. At the end of that time there was not the slightest appearance of dampness on the interior.—The Brick builder.
