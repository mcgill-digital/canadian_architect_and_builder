JOHN L. PHILLIPS, Secretary.

I HE attention of the City Council of Toronto has recently been called to the fact that repairs are urgently required for the preservation of the residence of the late Mt. Howard, the donor of Howard Park. Mr. Howard, who was an enthusiastic antiquarian, bequeathed to the city not only many acres of beautiful park lands, but also his residence, stables, etc., with their interesting and valuable contents. To allow these to perish through neglect would Show a lack of appreciation of the donor's generosity which should he sufficient to discourage tile giving of like public bequests in the future.



IF we are to judge by the Slim attendance at the public meeting called in Toronto recently to discuss the construction of a trunk sewer, the citizens see no pressing necessity for the project being undertaken at present. That a better method of sewage disposal than the existing one is required cannot be questioned. A still more important matter at the present time, however, is the adoption and carrying out of means for increasing the water supply and for ensuring its purity. If the city's financial position will not warrant tile immediate commencement of both these undertakings, then precedence should certainly he given to the one last mentioned, upon the carrying out of which the health of the citizens so largely depends.



ON another page of this paper is printed the provisions of a by-law for the regulation of plumbing and drainage age work in the city of Montreal. This law, which has been under consideration for the past two years, finally passed the Council on the 24th of June. It appears to have been carefully framed, and will no doubt be the means of vastly improving the standard of plumbing and drainage work in tile future. From our knowledge  of the Sanitary condition of the city, an ordinance of this kind has long been a necessity. It is gratifying to observe one Canadian city after another thus providing means for the protection of the public health. If action had been taken in this direction years ago it would have resulted in the preservation of thousands of lives.



OUR attention has been attracted by an account of the annual meeting of tile Whitby Hedge Co., Ltd., to a new and apparently profitable title of business—the planting of hedges—in which the above company are the pioneers in Canada. The company show a substantial surplus on tile business already done, and unfinished contracts amounting to upwards of $12,000. Judging from its location and the personal of its managers, we presume this company's operations are confined to the rural districts. There is a growing opportunity in the cities also for work of this character. It is gratifying to see these evidences of the growth of the artistic instinct and sentiment among all classes of our people. As a result, the charm of landscape for which England  is famed may possibly in future characterize Canada also.



THERE was recently published tile statement that the cost of building operations in Winnipeg this season would he nearly double that of 1893, or between a million and a half and two million dollars. In view of tile general commercial depression, we read this statement with surprise. Its authenticity is now being called in question, and it is alleged to have had its source ill tile office of an enterprising real estate firm, whose methods are not unknown in some of our eastern cities. Building operations in Winnipeg are on a moderate scale, and are not likely to exceed the record of last year. British Columbia advises state that a quiet season is being experienced.
