NOTES.



Mr. <person>0. G. Carscallen</person>, Vice-President of the <firm>Gurney Tilden Company</firm>. of Hamilton, was recently presented by the travellers of the company with a gold-headed cane.



<person>Professor Galbraith</person>, Principal of the School of Practical Science, Toronto, was the guest of honor at a dinner held on Feb. 28th by the S. P. S. graduates resident in Pittsburgh.



The outcome of a lawsuit at Cleveland over a party wall dispute, has led to the giving of positive orders to the city engineering and building departments, to carefully survey property on which business buildings are to be erected in future and establish beyond question the lines of the lot or plot of ground on which such improvements are to be made. This will prevent a repetition of this case. Other large cities might profit by Cleveland's experience.





Analysis of the incrustations taken from the Portland stone balustrade round the base of the dome of <building>St. Paul's Cathedral</building>, shows them to be composed chiefly of hydrated sulphate of lime associated with some siliceous matter and minute particles 4 carbon in the form of soot. The solvent action exerted by rain charged with sulphurous and sulphuric acid derived from the gases and smoke of innumerable chimneys of the surrounding buildings has, after the lapse of two centuries, transformed the original carbonate of' lime of the Portland stone into sulphate of lime, which in a more or less soluble condition has been carried by water action and gradually deposited as calcareous tufa or

agmite on the underside of the coping-stone.
