MANUFACTURES AND MATERIALS

<article title=" NEW ARTIFICIAL FLOORING " author="">NEW ARTIFICIAL FLOORING.

A NEW artificial flooring material is said to he meeting with success in Germany. The material, which is the invention of a German named Knoch, is called Xyolith. It is said to be proof against sound, water, dampness and fire, and can be colored to represent tileing, or finished to represent wood or woods, varnished, polished, stained or finished in almost any way desired. It is very easy to the feet in walking, makes a very warm flooring, harbors no insects of any kind, is very easily kept in order, and is adapted for the walls and ceilings as well as floors. It is made by the folio wing process

Dissolve chloride of magnesium in water till the solution shows a hydrometer strength of 27-B-(Alkali Hydro. meter). In another vessel dissolve a pound of salt in a little more than a quart of water, and see that every particle of salt is dissolved. Into tub put sixty-six pounds of burned powdered magnesia and four and a quarter pounds of leather meal, made of ground up leather scraps. Pour on the salt solution and mix all together, then put in thirteen and a half pounds of the chloride solution, and knead all into a stiff paste. Great care must be taken to have this very thoroughly worked and of uniform consistency in all respects.

The material is now ready to spread on the walls or to lay on the floors, or to plaster on the ceilings. In covering on the floor, the whole floor can be covered at once if so desired, or it can be blocked off, and laid in figures and colors, as one's taste may indicate. In any case, the surface, floor or walls, should be smoothed as soon as possible. It hardens rapidly, and a floor laid one day is fit for use the following day. Increasing the amount of leather meal very much improves the durability and appearance of the material. Floors of this kind can he laid over old floors, if they are solid, and over stone, brick, tileing, or anything that affords a good sure foundation.

FROM the sixth annual report of the Ontario Bureau of Mines it is learned that there has been a steady decline since 1891 in the amount and value of various kinds of building materials manufactured in Canada. The statistics of the stone quarries show that the value of product in 1891 was $1,000,000 and the amount paid in wages $520,000. In 1896 the value of product was only $394,000, and the wages paid amounted to but $273,000. In 1891 there were manufactured 160,000 common brick, valued at $950,000, and 7,500 tile, valued at $90,000. The wages paid totaled $432,000. In 1896 there were manufactured 105,000 bricks, valued at

$377,000, and 13,200 tiles, valued at $144,000. The wages paid amounted to $306,000. It will be noticed that prices and wages have both declined. The comparison for pressed brick, roofing tile and terra cotta stands as follows 1891, 13,617,909, value, $156,699, wages, $58,000; 1896, 12,201,000, value, 129,845, wages, $60,000. Here we have a considerable decline in prices and an increase in wages. The production of lime in 1891 was 2,350,000 bushels; value, $300,000; wages, $116,000. In 1896 the production was 1,880,000; value, $220,000; wages, $85,000.



Regarding cements, the report states "The production

 of natural rock and Portland cements is well maintained as compared with previous years ; but while the makers of Portland cement have been steadily increasing the output of their works, and improving- the quality of the cement, they are far from being able to supply the requirements of the country. The raw materials for Portland cement are so plentiful in Ontario that we might be making largely for the export trade instead of importing for consumption." The increase has been much greater in Portland than in natural rock cement, the output of the former being 154 per cent. more in 1896 than in 1894, whereas that of the latter has been less than 10 per cent. The price is lower than in 1894, Portland cement having fallen from $2 to $1.77, and natural rock from 88 cents to 72 1/2 cents per barrel. The quality of both kinds is well maintained, and the fact appears now to be generally admitted that the Portland cement compares very favorably with the best of the same class made in Europe. The manufacturers, however, are not yet able to meet the demands of the home market, for during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, Canada imported 210,065 barrels, valued at $255,

029. The output of Canadian Portland cement is, however, likely to be very considerably increased this year.

The following table gives particulars of the production of various kinds of materials for the year 1896:

<article title="Publications" author="">PUBLICATIONS.

The Toronto Radiator Manufacturing Co., of Toronto, have just issued a handsome supplemental catalogue for the years 1897-98.



A copy of the proceedings of the twelfth annual meeting of the Association of Ontario Land Surveyors is to hand. It is a volume of over two hundred pages, and is rendered especially interesting by thc many valuable papers on surveying and engineering subjects, which shows the association to be progressive. Copies of thc report may be obtained from the secretary. Mr. A. J. VanNostrand, Yonge Street arcade, Toronto. The price is 75 cents.





Sandpaper is made with powdered glass instead of sand. Glass is easily powdered by heating it red-hot, throwing it into water, and finishing the powdering in an iron mortar.



The new Wortley road Baptist church, at London, Ont., of which Messrs. Burke & Horwood, Toronto, are the architects, was formally opened a few days ago. It is a brick structure costing $7,500, and has a seating capacity of 400.



According to Engineering, a Few days ago, the uses of a new cement, or petrifying substance, were demonstrated to a large party of Glasgow gentlemen at the works of Messrs. Morrison & Mason, Limited, Polmadie. For this new substance, to which thc name of ' Petrifite' has been given, many marvelous properties are claimed. It is a Continental invention, and already the parent rights have been taken up in Germany and Russia. Petri- file is a flour-like substance, composed, it is understood, of a peculiar kind of lime-stone mixed with chemical matter. Like Portland cement, it binds together gravel and sand; but while Portland cement can only be used as a binding element for washed sand and gravel, it is claimed for Petrifite that it can bc used for binding earth, peat, clay, lime, chalk, waste of mortar, pottery, glass, slate, any kind of sand, coal, burnt ballast, clinkers, ashes, straw grass, vegetabic or animal Fibre, alkali waste, sawdust, asphalt, pitch, etc.; and as the results of the petrifying process there may be produced building stones, ornaments, statuary, bricks, billiard balls, marble blocks and paving stones.
