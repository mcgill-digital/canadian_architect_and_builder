<person>AQUILLA Ormsby Graydon</person>, City Engineer of London, Ont., also claims that city as his birth-place, having been born there in July, 1854. He is the eldest son of the <person>late Simpson Hackett Graydon</person>, B.A., T.C.D., of Dublin, Ireland, but practising barrister in London, Ont., since 1853.

The subject of our sketch was educated at the public and grammar schools of London. In 1870 he entered the Mer chants' Bank of Canada, having filled the positions of junior ledger-keeper, teller and accountant. He left the Bank in 1874 to become paymaster for Mr. <person>Wm. Hendrie</person>, contractor, of Hamilton, Ont., in connection with his contract for building tile Wellington, Grey and Bruce railway from Listowel to Kincar dine, and was in his service for four years until all his railway contracts were completed, when he returned to London and articled himself to Messrs. <firm>Robinson & Tracy</firm>, both former City Engineers of that city. He studied engineering and architecture with them for four years, taking the degree of P.L.S. in his third year (1881).

Mr. Graydon was engaged on the construction of the London waterworks during 1882, and in 1883 opened an office for him self. lie was appointed engineer of the townships of London, Delaware, Rochester, East and West Nissouri and Biddulph, also of the <firm>London Provincial Line Road Co. </firm>Subsequently lie laid out the Brampton, (I)nt., waterworks, and supervised the construction thereof until nearly completed.

TRACTORS' ASSOCIATION</assoc>.



A VERY enjoyable time was spent at the second annual dinner of the above Association, held at Webb's restaurant on the evening of the 11th inst. Nearly one hundred members and invited guests were present.

Mr. <person>Geo. Wright</person>, President of the Association, occupied the chair, being supported on his right and left by tile Mayor and Mr<person>. Joseph Tait</person>, M.P.P. The vice-chairs were occupied by Mr. <person>J. Lester Nicholls </person>and Mr. <person>David Williams</person>.

Letters of regret at their inability to be present were read from Mr. <person>E. F. Clarke</person>, ex-Mayor, and Mr. <person>John Webb</person>, President of the Builders' Association of Hamilton.

The usual loyal and patriotic toasts were duly honored, Mr. Tait responding in happy style to " Our Legislators," and the Mayor to "The City Council." The latter took occasion to remark, that considering the importance of the building interests, and the frequent introduction of legislation in the City Council affecting these interests, he was surprised that the Association did not, as other organizations had done, appoint a committee to watch the proceedings of tile Council.

"The Old Association " was responded to by Mr. <person>John Lucas </person>and Mr. <person>Wm. Booth</person>, President of the first Association organized by the builders of the city some twenty years ago, and ex-Alderman Farquhar.

Messrs. <person>John Aidridge </person>and <person>M. Murphy </person>replied on behalf of The New Association," and Messrs. <person>Moir </person>and <person>Goddard</person> on behalf of " Kindred Institutions."

Excellent songs were sung by Messrs. <person>J. Lester Nicholls</person>, <person>R. G. Kirby</person>, <person>II. M. Blight </person>and <person>F. Self</person>, while Messrs<person>. H. K. Cockin</person> and <person>O. A. Simley </person>favored the company with well-rendered recitations.

Credit for the success of the gathering is largely due to (lie committee of management, <person>Messrs. Geo. Wright, D. Williams</person>,

<person>J.	Aldridge</person>, <person>J. Claxton</person>, <person>J. Goddard</person>, <person>J. Crang</person>, <person>J. Lester Nicholls </person>and <person>F. Powell</person>.

It is understood that the Association is to some extent being reorganized on an improved basis. The annual meeting will take place next month.

I heard a sermon recently from the text "Build yourselves up in your most holy faith." On the whole the subject may be said to have been well handled. After pointing out that every man is the builder of his own moral structure, tile speaker proceeded to describe some of tile requisites of a good building, such as a good design, a good plan, a good foundation, good materials, etc. Having satiety got this far, he was tempted to go farther and illustrate his subject by directing the attention of his hearers to a building embracing all the requisites of good architecture. lie pointed to his ideal in language somewhat like the following "Take, for example, the new <building>Parliament buildings in Queen's Park</building>. As we enter them a glance at the long halls, large assembly rooms, etc., shows their adaptability to their purpose, while as we view their exterior we are lead to exclaim, 'Our sense of beauty is fully satisfied." I am charitable enough to presume that the preacher's religious ideals are of a higher order than is his artistic perception.

What resident of Toronto is not ready to express his gratification at seeing the sum of $20,000 placed in the estimates of the Parks and Gardens Committee of the Council for tile improvement of the approaches to Queen's Park? I would like to entertain the hope that stone—artificial or otherwise —and asphalt will shortly take the place of the dilapidated cement sidewalk and macadam roadway which for the past decade have marred the beauty of Queen's Avenue. It is to be hoped tile newly installed Council's anxiety for retrenchment will not lead them to apply the knife to this very necessary appropriation.

<article title="value of waterworks" author="">VALUE OF WATER WORKS.

From the Eighteenth Annual Report of the city of Grand Rapids, Mich., some insight into the financial value of water works can be gained. The report says

"No credit has ever been given to time water works system for fire protection, which makes it appear at the first sight that tile water system does not make a good financial showing. But taking into consideration the reduction of insurance rates on the residences, manufacturing plants, and all property liable to destruction by fire, it clearly shows that a water plant is the best paying in vestment that any municipality can make. To illustrate : Information from insurance headquarters shows that tile amount of property insured in this city is from $20,000,000 to $22,000,000 The rates of insurance are from one-fourth of one per cent. to five per cent. per annum. Before the establishment of the present efficient fire department and time existence of our water system rates of insurance were from one per cent. to ten per cent. per annum. From the same source we learn that the amount of property insured is equally divided between low and high rates, and that the average in insurance is fully two per cent., in consequence of the facilities for extinguishing fire. This would make a saving to our citizens of at least $40,000 per annum from this source alone during the past year."

FOR the benefit of draughtsmen who are occupied before April upon the work of the Association examinations, the time for rending in drawings for this competition will be extended to May 21st next. All drawings must be marked by a motto or cypher, and the name and address of the designer enclosed in envelope bearing the same mark.



Dr. <person>A. M. Rosebrugh</person>, of Toronto, has patented a "Combined window ornament and ventilator," which consists of a short supplemental sash secured to upper window sash. This presents a direct draft over this upper sash when the same is lowered a few inches and provides for an indirect draft through the siphon-like space formed by tile overlapping of the upper and lower sashes. This fans a gentle current upwards towards the ceiling and promotes the diffusion of fresh air with out perceptible draughts. The supplemental sash may be plain glass, colored glass or bevel plate, and may be adapted to any building, new or old. When secured to the outside stops they do not interfere either with outside shutters or with winter sash. A company is being formed to operate tile patent.
