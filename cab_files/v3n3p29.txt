<person>B.	Johnston </person>and <person>H. C. Eddis </person>(equal); second place, <person>Win. Rae</person>. It goes without saying that the criticism of <person>Mr. Darling </person>was

most helpful, both to the competitors themselves and all present. Before concluding his remarks, Mr. Darling gave some general notes and criticisms on the subject of the American style of draughtsmanship.

On the evening of Tuesday, March 11th, a special effort was made to provide an entertainment of interest to the general public, and a number of invitations, lithographed in a very artistic manner, were sent out. The lecturer of the evening was Mr. <person>J. A. Radford</person>, and his subject "An Architect's Trip through France and Sunny Italy." This was illustrated by some sixty very fine stereoptican views, thrown on a large canvas by Mr. <person>Ernest Wilby</person>'s stereoptican. These views had been prepared especially for the occasion. The constantly changing scenes of beautiful buildings and beautiful lands, together with the graphic description and the humorous incidents of the lecturer's own trip, stirred up a longing in every one present to see for themselves these countries.

On account of the large number of outsiders present, a little innovation was made in the ordinary business of the Club by calling on some of the local talent to entertain the audience during intermission. Mr. <person>J. H. Fawell'</person>s song with guitar accompaniment was well received. Mr<person>. H. Simpson</person>'s exhibition of ventriloquism elicited the wonder of all present. His imitation of saw cutting had an architectural character about it which "brought down the house."

The hope was generally expressed that at some future time the Club might have the pleasure of again listening to the talented speaker of the evening, and a hearty vote of thanks was awarded him for the trouble be had taken to provide the entertainment. Mr. <person>C. J. Gibson</person>, who has taken charge of the class work of the Club, reports good progress in the water color class, under the tuition of Mr. <person>C. M. Manly</person>, the members showing marked improvement in their work at each lesson. He has completed arrangements with the same teacher to start a pen and ink class, and hopes that a large number will send their names to him to be enrolled as members. The fees will be three dollars for the course of six lessons, and work will commence immediately.

F one plank would hold up one hundred pounds on the centre, then two planks placed side by side would hold up two hundred pounds while, placing the planks one on top of the other, and nailing them firmly together, they would hold up four hundred pounds. In this way we see that, in order to increase the strength of the bridge or beam faster than we increase the amount of material, the increased amount of material should go into the depth of a beam and not into the width of it, This is one of the first principles in the resistance of material, that the strength of a beam varies directly as the width—that is, if we make it twice as wide, it will hold twice as much; and that the strength varies as the square of the depth—that is, if we make

it twice as deep, it will hold up four times as much. If we make it three times as deep, it will hold up nine times as much of a load. So that it can be readily understand that, in order to increase the strength of the bridge or beam without increasing the material in the same proportion, the increased amount of material should be put into the depth and not into the width.

The <assoc>Architectural Guild of Toronto </assoc>have very kindly appointed a committee from their number to judge the above competitions. We shall publish each report as sent to us by the committee. Draughtsmanship, neatness and clearness of arrangement of drawings will be taken Into Consideration In awarding positions.

Drawings must be made on sheets of heavy white paper or bristol board 14 X 20 inches in size, and must be drawn to allow of their being reduced to one-half the above size. Drawings must be made in firm, strong lines, with pen and black ink. No co]or or brush work will be allowed.

Each drawing must be marked with the nom de plume of its author, and the author's name, nom de plume and full address, enclosed in sealed envelope, must accompany each drawing sent in.

We reserve the right to publish any design sent in.

Drawings will be returned to their authors within a reasonable time after the committee has given its decision.





<article title="Methods of mental computations" author="Baillairgé, Charles ">METHODS OF MENTAL COMPUTATION.

QUEBEC, March 8th, 1890.



Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



- Sir,—One of your correspondents gives a short and easy mode of mentally computing board measure, or of reducing scantling and plank to board measure. It may not be uninstructive to the profession to know how mental calculation can be applied to compute the weight of bar iron of any size, without the use of the ordinary tables when not at hand, or even when they are, to save the time of searching for the page and item required.

A cubic foot of wrought iron weighs 480 lbs., therefore 1 ft, square by x inch thick, weighs 40 lbs. Now this is the on]y figure necessary to be remembered, and is immediately divisible mentally by 2, 4, 8, etc. Thus a square foot iron A" thick weighs 2C lbs., = xo lbs.,_ 1/8" = lbs.,

=	2½ lbs 1-32" = 1¼ lbs., 1-64" = 5/8 lbs.



Now suppose we wish to compute the weight of a bar of iron of any length and of 3/8" X 3". Since 1/8 gives lbs. to the square foot. 31/8 gives 3 times that or 15 ]bs., and as the bar is only 3" wide cr 22475f a foot, its weight WI]] be 1/4 of 15 lbs., of which the half is 7½ lbs, and the half of this

 lbs which into the number of feet in length of bar gives the required result and all this is done in much less than half the time I have taken to write or read the process.

If the bar is x 7/8", the process in this case is simplified by spreading it out mentally into a sheet 1/8 thick. Now 7 X 7=49-8 and 49-8=6 1/8 inches. Again 6" of 1/8" thick equal ½ of lbs. or 2½ lbs., and the remaining 1/8 inch or 1-48 may be either neglected or added; thus: 21/2 lbs.

=21/2 times i6 oz. 40 oz. which gives say x oz., or more correct]y 4-5 of an ounce, together 2½ lbs. +4-5 oz. or 2 lbs. 9 OZ. nearly. If the bar is ¼ inch square: spread it out mentally into a sheet  12393928nch

thick. Now 5-4 inch x5 tlmes=25-4 or 6¼--6 inch of ¼ inch iron=5 lbs. and the ¼ inch=I-24 of 6 inches or say 1-25 and 1-25 of 5 lbs.=1-5 lbs., then the bar=5 1-5 lbs. to the foot lin.; Or the 3/8 inch bar of the first example if preferred may be spread out into a sheet 1/8 inch thick and if 2½ inches wide, will give 7½ inches broad if 1/8 inch iron, and 6 inches if it is equal 2½ lbs and the remaining 1½ inch= 1/8 of 12 inches or 1/8 of 5 lbs. or 5/8 of a lb. together 3 1/8 lbs. for a lineal foot of the given size.

For round iron. compute as if square and then multiply by decimal 7854 or take say 7j per cent, of the weight of the square bar, but as this is difficult to compute mentally, let us call it 804575200r 4-5; or from computed weight for square deduct 1-5 for round, which leaves you on the safe side and helps to make up for odds and ends which may escape your attention.

With regard to cast-iron, its weight is but 430 lbs. to the foot cube, or 1-16 lbs. less than wrought iron, therefore, compute as for wrought iron to avoid fractions, and deduct 1-16 if necessary, though to allow for extra thickness and to be on the safe side I seldom make the deduction.
