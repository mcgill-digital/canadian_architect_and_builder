<doctype type="text;ad">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



Since the experiments made in 1878 by <person>Flugge</person> on the quantity of air that passes through the walls of a room and produces what has been called "spontaneous ventilation," it has been believed, says the Revue Scientifique, that for small rooms with reasonably tight walls, the air is renewed in the proportion of 0.077 of the volume per hour and per degree (Centigrade) of difference between the inside and outside temperatures. For instance, or a difference of fourteen degrees C, (252 degrees Fahr.) the entire air would bc renewed in one hour. Experiments to verify the exactness of these figures have been made by <person>H. Wolpert</person>,

who has determined hour by hour the proportion of carbonic acid gas contained in the atmosphere of an empty room, the measured diminution enabling him to show the activity of the air movement inward. The Bulletin des Ingenieurs Civils gives the



following results For rooms with a capacity of sixty cubic metres (about 2,000 cubic feet), with masonry walls covered with paper, the hourly co-efficient of renewal Was 0025 per degree of difference of temperature, the actual difference being 126 degrees C. 22.7 degrees Fahr.) For rooms with walk covered with oil-paint the co-efficient fell to 0017, and it rose to 0'053 for ordinary whitewashed walls.
