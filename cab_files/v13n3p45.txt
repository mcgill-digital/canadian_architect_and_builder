<article title="The Eighteen Club" author="">WE have consented to place one of the illustration pages in future numbers of

the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER at the disposal of the Eighteen Club, which, as many of our readers are aware, is composed of a number of the younger architects of Toronto. This page will bear the name of the club, and will show illustrations of the work of the members. The designs will be selected by a vote of the members at the weekly meetings of the club, and will no doubt be looked for with interest, as exemplifying the ideas and tastes of the oncoming generation of architects.



<article title="A Substitute for Portland Cement" author="">A WRITER in the London Building News describes experiments made in Belgium with slag cement as a substitute for ordinary Portland cement. The results of these tests are stated to have been so satisfactory that slag cement was substituted for Portland in the construction of the works for the improvement of the water supply of Brussels. A saving of $12,000 is said to have been effected by the change in material, the slag cement costing ten shillings less per ton, being also higher, of greater volume, and capable of being used immediately after manufacture. This writer gives the following description of the methods employed to test the material "In the first place, the conditions of test were identical for all the specimens, whether they related to the tensile and compressive strength, the degree of crushing or trituration, the action of boiling water or the force of steam. It was impossible to adopt a uniform standard of density, because while that of ordinary cement averages about 3.12, it is only 2.75 for the
