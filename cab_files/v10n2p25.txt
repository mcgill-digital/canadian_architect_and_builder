DURING the last month the suggestion A Statue of The has been made that Toronto should

erect a statue of the Queen in commemoration of Her Majesty's Jubilee. The idea should be acted upon, though not with much haste as Would be necessary to satisfy the desire of the daily paper that wishes to see the statue in situ on the 21st of June next. It may be possible to buy a " ready made" statue, but the wisdom of so doing is open to question. We should like to see instituted a properly arranged competition for designs, in which Canadian artists and sculptors would be given an opportunity to display their best talents.

		officers have had much experience in



connection with the Ontario Association of Architects, and can be relied on to do everything g that should be done for the success of the organization. They will bear in mind also that upon the success which may be achieved by the Toronto Chapter will depend whether the step taken by the architects of Toronto shall be followed by those of other cities throughout Ontario. The movement, if properly supported, should be the means of awakening greater interest in architectural matters, while at the same time broadening the influence and usefulness of the Ontario Association of Architects.



Architectural Education- <assoc>THE Society of Architects of Great Britain </assoc>will renew its efforts to secure Britain. the passing of the Architects' Registration Bill at the next meeting of Parliament. The president of the society, in his address at the opening meeting recently, thus expressed himself on the subject : "The bill now 'hung up' and awaiting the opening of Parliament is a measure having for its object the removal of evils which affect the best interests of both the public and the profession. I therefore bespeak for it your continued, persistent, and earnest efforts to place it on the statute book, as a fitting recognition of the sixtieth anniversary of our good and gracious Queen's reign, in the hope that that year may be signalized by placing architectural art and practice on a high level of educational distinction, insuring that all aspirants for the profession shall enter upon their pupilage with a thorough equipment calculated to develop genius on the lines of truth, to foster art and promote science—an alliance which will result in the growth of strength, fitness and beauty as a leading and general characteristic of the designs of the future. The evils arising from incompetency, which are acknowledged by all to exist, will be, meanwhile, gradually eliminated by the gentle hand of Time, without harshness, or what Parliament would designate injustice."
