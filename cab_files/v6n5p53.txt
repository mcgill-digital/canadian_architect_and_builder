In a recent letter to the city in reference to the court house question, Messrs<firm>. Neelon & Co</firm>.'s solicitors state that labor and materials are very perceptibly lower at the present time than they were in i888. This is incorrect, in fact the movement is the other way. Stone-cutters who received 38 cents per hour in that year are now getting the high wage of 43 cents, and bricklayers now receive 35 against 33 1/2 cents per hour in 1888 The material market also shows some prices to have risen, and Stone, the material more particularly referred to, is 20 per cent. dearer than at that time





WE had the pleasure of presenting to our readers some months since a brief paper on " The Doorway," originally presented by Mr. <person>Gemmell</person> for the consideration of the members of the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Guild</assoc>. It was intended to serve as the introduction to a series of brief papers by members of the Guild on the subject of house design. It will be a matter of regret to our readers to he informed that the further consideration by the Guild of this interesting subject was conducted orally, and the results are consequently in a measure lost.





THERE is room for much improvement in the efficiency of electric door bells as in many instances they are fitted up. It is not an infrequent thing to see posted above the push button beside a residence door, the intimation " Bell out of order; please knock It sometimes happens, as in the case of a prominent Toronto merchant, recently, that considerable time elapses before the inmates of the house become aware that the door bell is failing to discharge its duty. The merchant's friends in vain had been pushing the button for a week or more. When at last the discovery was made that the bell was not working, the owner went down town and expended $3.50 in repairs. What was his regret at having (lone SO when the first person to demand admittance after the bell had been put in older was a policeman bearing a warrant summoning him to the police court to show cause why he had not removed the snow from the sidewalk in front of his premises.





THE Ministers of Finance and Customs are at present receiving deputation's representing the various important manufacturing and commercial interests of the country for the purpose of learning what readjustment of the existing tariff is required. The present may therefore not be an inopportune time to mention that architects have reasonable ground for complaint in this connection. Few if any of their supplies are or ever will be manufactured in Canada. Even the United States has thus far been able to produce only the cheaper grades of drawing paper and instruments. In view of these conditions, the duty of 25 to 35 per cent. imposed upon these materials when imported into this country from Europe must be considered unnecessarily burdensome. It might very properly be reduced by at least 50 per cent. Canadian architects at present find themselves in the unfortunate position of being highly taxed on everything they require to use, while virtually the tariff does not protect them from the competition of foreign architects.





In the construction of elevator shafts arid the fitting up of elevators, architects would do well to see that a space of five to seven feet at least is provided between the top of the elevator when it reaches its highest point of travel and the roof of the shaft. The necessity for such a requirement was brought to our attention by an accident which happened recently. The automatic regulating device connected with an electric elevator failed to operate when the current was turned on, and the car shot up the shaft. Fortunately it was empty, and more fortunately still, two attendants who a moment before were on the top of the car for the purpose of oiling the slides, had made their exit from the shaft. If the accident had occurred one minute earlier these men must have been crushed to death at the top of the shaft, as the stopping point of the car is only two or three feet below the roof. This is not the first occurrence of the kind that has come to our notice. In addition to the necessary provision above mentioned, the safety of passengers demands that the controlling devices be made more effective.
