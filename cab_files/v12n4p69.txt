ONLY five sets of plans were submitted St. Lawrence Market in the competition for designs for the

Competition.

remodelling of St. Lawrence market, Toronto. Good reason must exist for the lack of interest taken in this competition, the subject being well calculated to attract the attention of the best minds in the profession. The failure of the competition as regards the number of competitors can doubtless be attributed to the inadequate character of the rewards. Architects should not be expected to give services worth $4,000 for the chance of winning a prize of two or three hundred dollars. The opinion generally prevailed that the work could not be carried out within the limit of cost imposed, namely, $150,000. It will be remembered that Mr. Sheard, who was appointed by the Council to report on the cost of the work, estimated the price at upwards of $300,000. The result of the competition will probably not be known for two or three weeks. The examination of the plans will occupy considerable time, as full working drawings, embodying all details of construction, were required.



AN enterprising Toronto paper, in the Signed Buildings, daily search for news, has discovered



that the words "E. J. Lennox, Architect, 1889," have been carved in stone beneath the cornice around the four sides of the new municipal buildings. The announcement of this fact is headed, "Lennox's Gigantic Gall!" and we are told that "the well-taxed citizens of Toronto ought to present Architect Lennox with the new civic building and be done with it." The citizens, sensible people that they are, have declined to follow the newspaper's example by going into hysterics about so unimportant a matter. It is pertinent to inquire what crime has been committed. It is a recognized custom in Belgium for architects to affix their names to their buildings, and the practice has many advocates among the profession
