THE first step towards affording free technical instruction to the artisan classes was taken in Toronto at the beginning of the present year, when the City Council made a grant for the purpose. The results are said to be very satisfactory, and such as to warrant the continuance of the undertaking. The attendance has not been far short of two hundred, and it is gratifying to learn that a large proportion of the students have come from the ranks of workmen connected with the building trades.



IN a letter published in this number an architect asks for information concerning the varieties of Canadian building stones and the names of quarry owners, and expresses surprise that this information is not to be found in our advertising pages. It is obviously to the interest of every manufacturer and dealer in building appliances to keep his materials and his name and address before the notice of the principal consumers. The advertising pages of this journal are undoubtedly the best medium for that purpose.



THE <assoc>Toronto Builders' Exchange </assoc>continues to make satisfactory progress. The brick manufacturers have recently connected themselves with the organization, and nosy constitute one of the sections of the Association, the total membership of which has reached about one hundred and fifty. The new rooms which are being fitted up at the corner of King and Victoria streets for the use of the Exchange, are expected to be ready for occupation in less than a fortnight. Preparations are being made for an enjoyable house warming to mark the removal of the Exchange to its new home.



THE Dominion Parliament has appropriated $10,000 to the purpose of erecting a statue of the late Sir <person>John A. Macdonald</person>. It is said to be the intention to invite competitive designs from Canadian and European artists. A rare opportunity is thus afforded of displaying the worth of native talent. Care should be taken to make the most of it. The result of the efforts put forth by Canadian artists in this competition will have a distinct effect upon the future progress of art in this country. Much will also depend upon the wisdom which the government may display in the selection of competent and impartial persons to judge the

designs.	_____________________







THE Building Register of Washington, makes the suggestion that in office buildings hereafter constructed, provision should be made for the storing of bicycles. It is pointed out that at present persons using these machines must leave them outside, where they obstruct travel or are exposed to thieves, or place them in corridors and halls, where they are equally out of place. The number of users of bicycles is very large, and they are such an indispensable means of locomotion in many branches of business that the number is rapidly increasing. If the increase is as great in proportion in the future as it has been in the past the law-makers will be obliged to take in hand the matter of keeping them off the street.



A DEPUTATION waited on the Minister of Customs and Public Works a few days ago to ask for an increased duty on Portland cement ; also that the standard of this material be made as low as is compatible with public safety and that preference be given on all public works to cement manufactured in Canada. Considering that hardly any two persons conducting a test will attain to the same results with a given bland of cement, it seems to be a matter of little importance whether the standard
