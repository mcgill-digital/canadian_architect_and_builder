In conclusion I desire to congratulate the plumbers of Kansas upon the many signs of improvement in our business that can be seen throughout the state. The general prosperity of the state has been felt by us, but how much of our success is due to the vigilant work of our officers, who, backed by nearly every plumber in Kansas, have been able to protect our rights and interests. Let us renew our pledge to stand firmly by the regulations of our association and comply strictly and honorably with its requirements and obligations.

<article title=" A LADY CONTRACTOR " author="">A LADY CONTRACTOR.

For the first time in his life <person>David Doak</person>, a con tractor of Philadelphia, wishes he were a woman Mr. Doak, say-s the Baltimore Architects' journal began to realize the advantages of belonging to the opposite sex when <person>Mrs. Hugh Brady </person>got the job of clearing out the debris after the <firm>Hunt-Wilkinson </firm>fire away from him, and he had to content himself with obtaining the contract to pull down the walls.

In the beginning Mr. Doak watched from afar with resentful, skeptical eyes as he saw a woman in a golf cap arrive with six men and dump-carts. ''But say," said Mr. Doak in tones of unqualified admiration "she's all right. She knows her business. While she was at the building I had to go away back and sit down. Nobody looked at me, nobody listened to me. My own men wouldn't pay any attention to me. She was the whole thing. They came from the papers and wanted to take her picture, but she wouldn't have it. I said 'Take me,' but nit. They- told me to go away-before I cracked their lenses. The reporters wanted to interview her, and she wouldn't have that either. I told then I would talk, but they said they didn't want to hear me. is she smart ? You bet she is. She makes me feel like thirty- cents. Is she young ? Is she good-looking ? She's everything I am not," said Mr. Doak humbly. ''She can get her men to fill the carts by giving them one good sharp look. I couldn't get them to do it with a club. I used to pity women just on principle ; but never again," he said, "never again. I envy 'em." And he started after a man who put three shovels full of dirt in his cart and called it a load.

Mrs - Hugh Brady is the only woman contractor in Philadelphia. She kept on with her husband's business when he died. She has made a success of it and is known as a shrewd business woman. She takes contracts to haul ashes, clear away the debris after fires, or anything, in fact, that other contractors in the same line of work are in the habit of doing.



<article title=" TERRA COTTA BLOCKS " author="">TERRA COTTA BLOCKS.

The lapse of twenty years has not seen much improvement in the manufacture of terra-cotta blocks for building purposes, say-s a writer in the British Clayworker. It is true that the blocks fit together a little better than they used to do, and there is more prompt delivery-, but that is about all. The old grievance that the walls of the hollow blocks are not thick enough is still with us, though several firms have made a praiseworthy attempt to remedy this state of things. Of course, we are not speaking of ordinary clay- made up into blocks, and sold as terra-cotta, but of such products as result from the real raw material, as understood by artists. A scientific study of the shrinkage of clay used for good terra cotta, their behaviour in the kiln, and matters of a kindred nature has y-et to be undertaken to get better results. Our knowledge in regard to this subject seems to be extended to some extent by recent discoveries in Crete, though people say that the study of ancient methods is of no use.
