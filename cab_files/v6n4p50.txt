TERRA COTTA: ITS USE AND ABUSE.

OF late there has been a desire to discuss the merits and application of sundry materials in which manufacturers and artists have an interest. Concrete, iron and steel, plaster, and, lately, terracotta, have formed the staple of these discussions. for each of these has its champions and defenders as well as its detractors. Controversial meetings of this kind may not be the most practical or convincing means of promoting the use of any raw material or system, for advocates and producers are naturally prejudiced, while those who come to find fault are generally blind to every merit, as they seek to magnify every defect. We remember the time, however, when the advocates of iron and concrete were in a small minority, and had to bear the brunt of much more powerful opposition than they have now. Red brickwork and terracotta have passed through a similar obloquy and ridicule and the friend of both materials can now smile on the complete reversa1 of fortune that has taken place.

With regard to the last named material, we have heard a good deal of late, and the manufacture of terracotta has formed the subject of a series of articles in the Building News. Of course like iron, and concrete and brickwork, it has had its opponents, who are generally uncompromising antagonists, able and willing to see nothing in favor of a material which is of a modern introduction, or reintroduction, and which has taken the place of stone to a large extent. Opposition of this kind does good in the long run, because it stimulates manufacturers and architects to make more strenuous efforts to disarm opponents. For example, one of the obstacles to the employment of terracotta has been difficulty in preventing the warping of the clay in drying and the shrinkage in burning. Now this obstacle has been practically removed by the process of manufacture described by Mr<person>. S. H. Leech</person>, of Messrs. <firm>Doalton</firm>'s firm, in a paper read by him at the Institute on Recent Developments in the Manufacture, and briefly reported in our last issue. The repeated complaints made by architects of

line and distorted appearance of blocks used in cornices and string-courses, and other horizontal and vertical features like window jambs and pilasters. have to a large degree ceased, for producers of the material have, by increased care in preparing the clay, and in the process of drying and burning, been enabled to turn out blocks and pieces of terracotta of wonderful truthfulness and homogeneity of texture and colour. Another objection to the use of this material made by some architects is that from the nature of the manufacture it encourages repetition of details. Both of these objections no longer hold good. By the system of "direct working

carried out in the new process of manufacture by Messrs. Doulton, the clay is compressed into a state that can be finished in one operation—in fact, manipulated by hand. The block of clay is so nearly solid that it can be treated and finished much in the same manner as a block of stone; the blocks of cellular terracotta do not require to be filled up with concrete, and can be cut to any dimension and shape for fitting round iron stanchions for shafts or other purposes. Being amenable to hand the compressed clay is capable of being directly worked by the artist instead of being subjected to a process of moulding which destroys all traces of the artists' touch.

These advantages of the direct method" of working deserve recognition. As Mr. <person>Ingress Hell </person>pointed out in his thoughtful paper on this subject, we must divest our minds of the habit of thinking in stone, in dealing with this material, and until this habit is acquired our terracotta architecture will be a failure. One of the distinctions between working in stone and terracotta is that in the former material the mouldings and ornaments are produced by sinking the field. By a succession of sunken planes the mason produces his cornices, architrave's; every moulding and ornament is sunk in the stone, even the enrichments and foliage of cornices and capitals in Classic as well as in Gothic work were roughly blocked out in the form of a rectangular or splayed projection in the stone, and then the carving was sunk below it. But this principle is not necessary in terracotta; the modeler can superlay and add on to the planes of the block, the moulding can be overlaid with ornament separately modeled, and, in fact, the whole feature can be built up in the clay or manipulated in any imaginable way; so that instead of sinking below the surface of the block to produce the moulding or ornament, the modeler can stick on his foliage or tracery. The effect to the eye of both systems is the same, but the process of production—one by sinking the field, and the other by overlaying it—is different, and seems to suggest that in terracotta, the designer, being less restricted by margins and planes, should have a different motive; in fact, his relief and ornamentation might be more often the impaslo method. Certainly, stone forms of architecture are not those that should be copied; nor should we like to see revived a meaningless rococo" style in clay. Both extremes should be avoided. No doubt Mr. <person>Leonard Stokes' </person>attack on terracotta derives much of its sting from the utter disregard of these

1rinciples rather than from any deeper cause. He sees rightly enough its abuse in the hands of men who have taken to it because it is fashionable, and cheaper than stone. That it can be called a "miserable mockery composed of mimic masonry ' only proves the proposition we have advanced, and does not in the least damage the material in the eyes of the real artist with independent motives for doing better. Many objections can he urged against the application of this material. The concrete filling to terracotta blocks is no doubt open to the objection of sometimes causing fracture of the block by the inequality of the strains induced in the mass for this

reason the "cellular plan is an advantage, because a greater substance can be given to the blocks. As a casing material for iron columns, fronts of shops, and the like, terracotta offers advantages over stone and even brickwork. Of course such an example as the church piers and arcade mentioned by Mr. Stokes, embedded in which iron stanchions are used with a girder over the tops of the arches to carry the clerestory, is an abuse of the material altogether. If small piers are required, why should not small solid blocks of terracotta be used like moulded bricks? and why should not the arches be solidly constructed in the same manner? But all the objections urged against it constructively and artistically are avoidable. The arguments against its durability, its colour, and its dreariness apply with more force against many kinds of stone which become dull and monotonous in the extreme. Can we look with any satisfaction on the black and furred appearance of many of our London smoke-begrimed facades?

Mr. <person>W. B. Malcolm </person>is enlarging his business premises on Church street, Toronto, and is fitting up new offices and show rooms.

The <firm>Standard Drain Pipe Co</firm>., of St. Johns, Que., are sending out an attractively printed illustrated price list of their products.

A company with a capital stock of $250.000 is being formed to take over the business of Messrs. <firm>C. B. Wright & Sons</firm>, cement manufacturers, at Hull, Que.

The <firm>Toronto  Vitrified Paving Brick and Stone Company</firm>. is being organized at Toronto with a capital stock of $500,000. Mr. <person>R. W. Prittie </person>is provisional director.

Messrs. <firm>Lefebore & Nelson </firm>are exhibiting in the <building>Imperial Building</building>, St. James street, Montreal, a display of metallic ore blocks used for facing old Or new buildings. It is proposed to establish large works for the manufacture of these goods.

The <firm>Toronto and Orillia Stone Co</firm>., Ltd., has lately been organized. The Company own a limestone quarry 45 acres in extent at Longford, Ont. The officers of the Company are President, <person>Andrew Tait</person>, Orillia; vice. president, <person>Joseph Tait</person>, M.P.P., Toronto; secretary, <person>E. C. Wainwright</person>, Orillia.

The <firm>Dominion Sanitary Pottery Company</firm>, of St. Johns, P.Q., is forwarding to the Chicago Exposition, sixty handsome specimens of closets, their own manufacture. The <firm>Artistic Decorating Co</firm>., of St. Johns, executed the decorations, which are most elaborate. The make and finish of the goods will compare well with the products of the great potteries of other countries.



Major <person>Trotter</person>, of the <firm>Standard Drain Pipe Co.. </firm>has invented an ingenious contrivance for saving coal in potteries. The heat of one kiln, after passing through the pipes, instead of going to waste, is made to go through

a second and third kiln. By this means three kilns are fired at the cost of or a saving of one-third of the amount of fuel used in the present system. The invention is to be patented in Canada and the United States.

The <firm>Fuller & Warren Company</firm>'s system of hearing and ventilation, which is in extensive use in the United States, is now being introduced into Canada by the <firm>Robb Engineering Co</firm>., of Amherst, Nova Scotia, having been installed during the past few months in new school buildings in three towns in Nova Scotia: Amherst, Yarmouth and Wolfville It speaks very highly for this system that it is in use in a large number of the best schools in Massachusetts. where legal enaetments have made it imperative to comply with the highest attainable sanitation.

We regret to have to announce that the manufacturing department of the <firm>St. Johns Stone Chinaware Company</firm>'s works at St. Johns, Que., was destroyed by fire on the 4th of March. The proprietors had recently completed extensive improvements, including new machinery costing $25,000. Their loss is placed at $100,000, against which there is insurance to the amount of $54,000. The works gave employment to 225 persons. The company will at once put into operation the Dakin pottery recently acquired by them, and it is expected will proceed as soon as possible to rebuild and re-furnish the works which have been destroyed.

Messrs. <firm>Richardson, Walker & Co</firm>., of Portland, Maine, who are extensive wholesale and retail dealers in southern pitch pine and eypress timber and lumber, write us that they have lately shipped some large orders into Canada, and believe that there will soon be a large demand in this country for southern woods. Cypress approaches most nearly in quality to white pine, which is becoming increasingly searce, and is claimed to be in some respects superior to the latter, as being firmer, less subject to contraction and expansion, capable of better finish, proof against insects, etc. Messrs. Richardson, Walker & Co. through our advertisement pages invite correspondence from Canadian architects engineers, builders, etc.

Many architects and builders consider that Longleaf pine that has been bled and tapped for turpentine suffers in strength by virtue of same and they restrict the use of it in construction, but by recent tests made by the forestry department at Washington. it has been proved that the timber does  not suffer from such tapings, On the contrary it exhibited if anything greater strength, which may be accounted for by the fact that turpentine orchards are located mostly on sites which produce better quality

and larger yields of turpentine. The reasons of the wood not suffering from these operations is because the older resins of the heartwood being non-fluid, the turpentine flow is confined to the sap wood. No difference dissemble in the appearance of tapped and untapped trees, and in specifications calling for unbled timber of this kind, such wood is often pirated without being discovered.
