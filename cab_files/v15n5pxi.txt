NOTES.



Our readers will no doubt be interested in the announcement in this number of thc <firm>Canada Supply Co. </firm>of Windsor, Ont., referring to an entirely new departure in roofing materials in Canada.



A second and enlarged edition of <person>Fred T. Hodgson</person>'s book on Estimating Frame and Brick Houses has been published by the <firm>David Williams Company, of New York </firm>and is sold at $1.00 per copy. The hook contains numerous scale drawings and other illustrations.



<firm>The Otis Elevator Company, of New York</firm>, have announced their intention of putting up a large factory in Canada for the manufacture of Otis elevators. Pending the selection of a suitable location, and the erection of a factory, they have leased <building>the elevator plant </building>of thc <firm>Leitch & Turnbull Company, Limited</firm>, at

Hamilton. It is understood that when the new factory is in operation, thc Leitch & Turnbull Company will act as Western selling agents for the Otis Company.



The statue of <building>Liberty Enlightening the World</building>, which stands at the entrance to New York Harbour, was the first work which brought <person>M. Eiffel </person>into notice. When several admirers of America in France resolved to l)resent it with a colossal statue that would be symbolic, <person>M. Bartholdi</person>, the sculptor, was invited to prepare the model. After many consultations it was determined that the figure should consist of a number of plates of copper, which were to be riveted together so as to form an exterior covering for a skeleton consisting of lattice girders. The designing of the interior structure was left to M. Eiffel, and his success led to his connection with the Eiffel Tower and his subsequent prosperity But for some unknown reason says the Builders' Reporter there was no great welcome for poor Liberty when she crossed the Atlantic. She was treated as it she were a white elephant, and was made a casus belli between various departments. At present we believe the War Department has charge of the gift. Mariners do not care for lights of a novel kind, and the flaming torch of Liberty is said to he of no avail. Orders have therefore been given for the light to be extinguished. The copper needs cleaning, and possibly the air may have injured some of the



plates. It will not. be complimentary to Frenchmen if their offering, which is the biggest statue in the world, should become a ruin.
