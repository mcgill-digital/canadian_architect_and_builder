<doctype type="text;ad">NOTE.

The following is said to be a method of determining the proportions of lime and sand present in mortar, accurate enough for all general purposes :â€”Take a small quantity of the mortar and dry it by heat. Weigh it carefully, then put it in a glass dish and pour on a strong solution of hydrochloric acid, and

leave for some time to allow it to dissolve all the lime. Then boil until dry, and pour on again plenty of water. Then pour on to a paper filter (to be bought at any chemist's) previously weighed; dry the filter with the contained residue, and weigh. This weight represents the earthy matter and grit, and the loss of weight found by deducting it from the weight of material before treatment is the amount of lime.
