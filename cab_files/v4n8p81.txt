and say— But the clerk of works does that.' True but who is to see that the clerk of works does it? Again, he should see the mortar made, handle the bricks and be instructed how to test them to see if they are sound and well burnt, to see the timber is free from sap knots, shakes, and other defects, and the joints in the bricks properly flushed the house built to required conditions. The iron works should also be visited, to see the girders riveted the preparation of piers and approaches, to see the men handle the work and put it in position. Many a lesson will be learned that wilt be of great value to the pupil when his turn comes to design. The stone quarries and clay pits should not he omitted. The saw-mill and timber yard are a very large factor in building. The conversion and manipulation of timber in all its branches is a study itself he should study our colonial timbers as well as the imported. I have to speak well of the timbers grown here, and they will compare with any imported if given a fair show suit the same treatment as their rivals               I have endeavored to show you the stumbling blocks that have been so much in the way in the past holding that when the student takes up the few things 1 have stated, a better understanding will come to architect, engineer, and artisan; that the noble aim of the one will he reflected on the other, to enable him to produce something grand; and, carrying the impress of the master-mind on one hand, and the skilful execution on the other, to show the soul of both. I have suggested study, you will need it. But the question is what to study; what to do? Surely there is plenty. But that is too much like the work already in band. Then spend your spare time in construction. Get some wood bricks, and build English, Flemish, or colonial bonds. You will be taught in your classes, if you understand them, how to test cement, to break beams ; try to originate for yourselves. Get a beam of your own, and find the constant; make your own lever, and break the beam. Try to calculate the stresses on the different parts of your roof principals, work them out graphically. As you can draw, this will not involve figures. If you have to draw a large chimney, do not he satisfied with having to draw it calculate what pressure of wind is necessary to overturn it, and if what you are drawing is stable, work out some of your engineering formula, and see if you can make a formula of your own. 1 think, gentlemen, if I wanted a man, I should not want to see what he had done, but what he could do now, and would like to see him use his tools and colors in my presence. Now imagine a question like this —(a) Draw two lines crossing each other by means of this square and drawing board, and test them for accuracy, and then (b) draw an elevation of a segmental window 6 in. x 3 in. rise of arch 9 in. A geometric drawing must not be male on your paper for the length of your radius. (c) Find me the centre of the circle in a semi-circular opening, having two equal semi-circles and the circle intersecting, and fill in and complete the frame for casement sashes. Again, write out a short specification governing the excavation and putting in of concrete foundations for a house at South Yarra. The ground has been tested, and the top is sand and loam. A uniform depth of 2 ft. is required all over to ensure stability, hut allow in your specification for extra foundation, if necessary. Now, gentlemen, take this last question. How many young men could sit down and write that in a proper manner? and take some six out of ten ordinary draughtsmen, and see if they could work out a, b, and c, in anything like a proper form ; and yet these young men can draw houses and color them on paper—could draw you the five or mere orders of architecture, if necessary. 1 am not despising drawing by any means, gentlemen. I rather like it, but a drawing to me must be of sonic use, and not of the kind that requires the practical knowledge and experience of a builder to make head or tail of it. Stamp your drawings and designs with true art and construction, and you will make the art workman, for he must train himself to understand and carry out your ideas. Get yourselves acquainted with the materials, the tools, and the men, and you will find that your learning is not a dangerous thing.

WE have before us the examination papers of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>and those of the <assoc>Quebec Association</assoc>. Copies of the former have been sent to all registered students, and we presume the same has been the case with the latter. The Quebec Association calls for only an entrance or matriculation examination, and examination for registration as architect. The Ontario Association interposes an intermediate examination, with the object of keeping the student more continuously at work, spreading the work more evenly, and reducing the tendency to cram towards the end. The examinations of the Quebec Association are to be held in July and December of each year, while those of the Ontario Association will be held for the first time on the 7th of April, 1892. We propose to print both papers in our next issue for the information of any who may not have received copies, and for the sake of the comparisons which may prove of interest to those concerned.



In plumbers work in England, it is usual to charge sheet lead by weight instead of measurement, although the weight is ascertained by measuring and not by weighing; lead-headed nails, wall-hooks and holdfasts are charged separately and by number; clout nails by the hundred ; pipes by the lineal foot; brass-work, pumps, closets, etc., by number.

<assoc>PROVINCE OF QUEBEC ASSOCIATION OF ARCHITECTS</assoc>.

THE first examinations of the Association were held on July 30 and 31st at which Messrs. <person>S. A. Findlay </person>and <person>W. B. Hutchison </person>presented themselves before the examiners for matriculation to enter the study of architecture. They both succeeded in passing this preliminary examination. The Board of Examiners who officiated were Messrs. <firm>Roy, Thomas and Taylor</firm>.

There was quite a large gathering of architects and students belonging to the cities of Montreal and Quebec present at a meeting held on the evening of Tuesday, August 4th, to formally open the new rooms which have been procured and furnished by the Association at 186 St. James street, Montreal.

Mr. <person>A. C. Hutchison </person>presided, and on behalf of the Council presented the rooms to the Association. The rooms will be open on Wednesday evenings from 7:30 to o'clock, and from 2 to 5 o'clock on Saturday afternoons. It is gratifying to be informed that a <assoc>Students Sketch Club </assoc>has been formed, the officers elect being as follows President, <person>Mr. Lareau </person>vice-president, <person>Mr. Wallace </person>secretary, Mr. <person>P. R. A. Labelle </person>; council, Messrs. <person>MacVicar</person>, <person>Crook</person>, <person>Falbord</person>, <person>Lafole</person>, <person>Harriett</person> and <person>Mattel</person>..

Messrs. <person>Hutchison</person>, <person>Raza</person> and <person>Clift </person>kindly lent books and photos for the use of the students for the evening.

The rooms engaged for the use of the Association have been neatly furnished, and the Council are now considering the formation of a library and procuring the different periodicals to lay on the tables. This they expect soon to accomplish, and by the winter to have regular lectures given to the students.



<article title=" CEILING DECORATION " author="">CEILING DECORATION.

IT is a very common fallacy, says Furniture and Decoration, that to color a ceiling is to lower it. Still more often is this result expected if projecting ribs or mouldings be added to divide the blank surface. Yet it may easily be shown in argument, as it is constantly exemplified in practice, that the opposite effect is quite as often produced, color being the determining agent. Let us assume the wall of a small private library, twelve feet high, to be hung with one of the embossed leather papers now in frequent use; the pattern brown and gold, on perhaps a warm green ground ; the bookcases below, of oak or walnut wood, with their contents, maintaining a quiet similarity of general tone. The cornice is, say, nine inches deep. If you leave it a light tint and the ceiling plain, the room will appear quite nine inches lower than it would were the cornice brown like the bookcase. And if this brown is continued on to the ceiling by means of wooden ribs, the room will gain at least another five inches of apparent height.

The fact is, that the point at which the attention is arrested by a marked contrast is that by which the eye assesses the height; and since the mouldings of the cornice project inwards to the room, even more apparent height is gained (than is marked in vertical distance) when the contrast is placed high, since advantage is taken of an apparent perspective.

On the other hand, if it be desired for other reasons to retain the wooden ribs and cornice, .yet not to add to the apparent height, a corrective is readily applied in color—either in the form of a narrow frieze of sufficiently emphatic contrast, below the cornice, or by contrasted relief of color at the same point as the cornice itself. Even a line of gilding may suffice.

In the same way the influence of a wide frieze or a dado on the proportions of a room is largely controlled by the coloring. A little frieze may be used of the same coloring, or even of the same depth of tone as the wall below, without materially affecting the apparent height ; but a very small amount of contrast in tone will be sure to tell in the case of a large plain surface. Hence, if a frieze with some contrast is to be used where height cannot be sacrificed, it is essential to place its brightest contrasts as high up and as near the cornice as possible, lest the eye be arrested at the bottom, and the frieze itself, together with the cornice, be relegated to the ceiling. Some rooms are high enough to bear this sacrifice of wall, in which case they largely gain in apparent width and space.



A piece of bluestone 20 feet wide, 24 feet 9 inches tong and 10 inches thick, was recently quarried near Kingston, N.Y., and it is claimed to he the largest piece of bluestone ever quarried. It weighs over twenty tons, and is so large that it cannot he used for any purpose until cut.
