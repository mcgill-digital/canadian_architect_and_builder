The "Canadian Contractor's Hand-Book" is handsomely bound in leather, is of convenient size for carrying in the pocket, and contains receptacle for money or memoranda. It is generally admitted by those who have seen the book that it is in itself well worth $2 to any contractor. In fact the "wages tables" alone are worth many times that amount to a contractor employing a number of workmen. Contractors and builders are invited to send us $2 and receive a copy of the "Canadian Contractor's Hand-Book" and the CANADIAN Architect AND BUILDER for one year.





 We regret that by a transposition of figures an error occurred in Mr. <person>Knox</person>'s article on "Factory Chimney Construction" in our last number. In the fifth paragraph, read

"for a chimney 100 feet high, multiply by 12 for a chimney 120 feet high, multiply by 11."



THE <firm>American Architect </firm>publishes a protest against unfair architectural competitions, which bears the signatures of architects from various parts of the United States and Canada. In view of recent events in this country, Canadian architects have the best of reasons for joining in such a protest.



THE courts have imposed a fine of $1,000 upon the city of London, Ont., for allowing its sewage to empty into the river. This decision should serve as a warning to Toronto and other Canadian cities which have been dallying for years with the question of sewage disposal, and apparently are as far as ever from a satisfactory conclusion.



THE Minister of Public Works for Ontario, stated in the Legislature the other day, that the amount expended on the new <building>Parliament Buildings</building>, up to the close of last year, was $308,646, made up as follows masonry, $244.353; carpentry and iron work, $8,531; brick, $12,037 <firm>St. Lawrence Foundry Co</firm>., $10,019; Mr. <person>Waite</person>, architect, $12,500; drainage, $21,265.

WE have received from a well-known New York architect a request for a copy of an illustration of Mr. Waite's

design for the new <building>Ontario Parliament Buildings</building>. Our correspondent adds to his request the following "I want to compare it with <firm>Darling & Curry</firm>'s beautiful design, which you published." We regret that we were compelled to reply that we had unsuccessfully endeavored to obtain from Mr. Waite the privilege of illustrating his design.





HAVING been requested by several of our subscribes to open a column of "Queries and Answers" on subjects connected with the building 'trades, we beg to inform our readers that we have made the necessary arrangements, and that in future we will publish each month, under this heading, such questions and answers on these subjects as we may receive. We leave it to our subscribers themselves to make this column a success. We feel sure that those who know will gladly assist those who want to know.



THE <assoc>Toronto Board of Trade </assoc>has accepted the amended designs of Messrs. <firm>James & James, of New York City</firm>, for its new building. These amended designs are published in the present number. We very much regret that Messrs. James & James have declined to allow us to illustrate their original competition design. We must allow them to be the judges of the
