side up; the sensitive paper is placed on negative prepared side down; this can be done in an ordinary room, but not too close to a window; the sensitive paper has nothing like the sensitiveness of the dry plates. The frame is then placed in a good light, not direct sunlight. It can be taken indoors and examined from time to time, and printing should be carried on until the print is a few shades darker than the finished photo is required, as it loses depth in toning. When a sufficient quantity are printed it is necessary to tone them and then fix the image. Toning can be done by gas or lamp light; and you will require to mix up a solution of chloride of gold with sufficient alkali to neutralize the acidity of the gold. The prints are first washed to get rid of the free silver, which leaves them of a brick red color, and then placed in toning bath. It is best to use crockery ware for the necessary dishes for toning. I myself generally make a raid on the kitchen for my supply. In a few minutes after placing in toning bath the prints will change to a more pleasing tone, and can be taken out at any stage desired, or can be left in until the tone is almost a black. Prints are then rinsed and placed in fixing bath for 15 minutes; they are then given a good washing and left to dry. All that then remains is to trim them and mount with starch.

There are several methods of printing, each of which has its own particular beauty and suitability for special subjects; you will find on table a few specimens of the different methods.

The many by-ways of photography, such as "1antern slide making," "enlarging" "stereoscopic work" and other branches, all have their devoted followers and enthusiasts, and all help to raise photography to that summit of true art which it richly deserves. When a camerist has perfected himself in the purely mechanical part of the processes, he then stays his hand at reckless firing off at everything he sees. He finds himself almost unconsciously developing a taste for something better than a merely good technical photograph, and by this means his mind is expanded; he sees beauties in nature he would otherwise have passed unheeded, and he finds himself the possessor of bits of composition that all help as an inspiration and make him feel that life is very well worth living.

Coming now to that very practical and important part, the cost, I think I can give you a full price list of the various articles required. A camera like mine, called the "Instantograph," will cost $15 complete with camera, lens, shutter, plate holder and tripod. The: dry plates cost 45 cents a dozen; scales and weights, 75 cents; 2 trays, 20 cents each; a 2 oz. glass measure, 30 cents; 2 stoppered bottles. 12 cents each; printing frame, 20 cents, The cost of chemicals and paper is purely nominal; I have worked out the cost of six prints finished complete, and it comes to an average of 10 cents for 6 prints, which includes everything except cost of dry plates. All these prices are for plate size.

I think I have now exhausted my subject, and I sincerely hope you are not in the same condition. I would say in conclusion that if there are any present who think of becoming amateur photographers, both our worthy president and myself are entirely at your service for any advice or help that you may require.

THE quarries of this company are situated at Potsdam, N. Y., and their selling yards for the Canadian trade at Prescott, Ont. The <building>Parliament Buildings at Ottawa</building>, are constructed of this stone. <person>Prof. J. S. Newberry</person>, of the Columbia College School of Mines., made an examination of the Potsdam quarries in 1860, and in his report says:

As I have said, I was surprised to find in the different quarries of this Company so many varieties of color in the stone. In the west quarries, the typical "Red Potsdam," either plain or banded, prevails. On their southern tracts are out-crops of homogeneous and monochrome, chocolate colored stone, in heavy ledges, which will yield blocks of any desired size. while in their quarries on the east side are exposed about fifty feet of rather massive layers, separated by a band of fifteen feet of foundation or bridge stone. The upper and lower bands composing the fifty feet referred to, are mainly of light colored homogeneous stone, to which I was a stranger before visiting the quarries. This is of a reddish cream color, very uniform in tint and pleasing to the eye. It comes out in layers from two to six feet in thickness, and splits with ease and certainty in any direction. With the chocolate colored stone, to which reference has been made, it may be combined with fine effect, one variety being used for trimming to the other, as corner stones, door and window caps, porches, etc., or associated as block stones in plain walls. This cream colored variety works with comparative ease, and may be wrought into mouldings and ornaments, much more cheaply than the harder varieties, which will be best used when hammer dressed, a style of treatment to which every phase of the stone will lend itself, as it breaks true and even under ham mer.

The different tracts of land controlled by this Company comprise about two hundred acres.





The long-established hardware firm of <firm>Aikenhead & Crambie</firm>, Toronto, has been succeeded by the <firm>Aikenhead Hardware Co</firm>. The business will be continued as before in the premises at No. 60 Adelaide street east, which will, however, be altered in such a way as will best serve the requirements of the business. A specialty will be made of builders' hardware. Mr. <person>Thos. E. Aikenhead </person>is the manager of the new company.

Messrs. Carroll & Vick, Toronto, are preparing specimens of brown Credit Valley stone for exhibition at the World's Fair. The block will be feet high by 2 1/2 on the side, and will be richly carved with foliage and the name of the stone, also the Ontario coat of arms.

<firm>The Toronto Chemical Smelting Company</firm>, of Port Colborne, Ont., is about to manufacture hard, black glass building and paving brick. The material is obtained as a result of the use of a new patent process of reducing and refining nickel from the ores, and would, unless utilized n this manner, be an absolute waste. It is claimed for these brick that they will be extremely bard and durable, and especially adapted for paving purposes. One of the streets in Port Colborne will shortly be paved with them.

Messrs. <firm>Pilkington Bros</firm>., the well known English glass manufacturers, have recently opened a Canadian agency in Montreal, and are protesting against the action of the Canadian Customs authorities in imposing a higher import duty on their material than is charged Belgian glass of the same quality. The matter is under consideration by the Controller of Customs. The effect of the discrimination against the English house is said to amount to about $100 in duty for every 1000 boxes of 100 feet of glass sold.

Mr. <person>Wm. Jones</person>, who was the original contractor for the erection of the <firm>Freehold Loan Company</firm>'s new building, Toronto, but was dismissed from the work by the architect, Mr. <person>E. J. Lennox</person>, on the ground that satisfactory progress was not being made, has caused writs to be issued against the Freehold Loan for $20,000 for work done, also for $20,000 damages for breach of the contract; against Mr. Lennox for $20,000 for trespass, and against <person>Mr. Snarr</person>, to whom the completion of the contract was entrusted, for $5,000 for taking possession of the plaintiffs property.
