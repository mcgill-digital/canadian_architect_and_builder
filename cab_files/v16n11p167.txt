Mr. Robert McCallum, for many

A City Architect For Toronto.	years on the engineering staff of

		the Department of Public Works

of Ontario, has been appointed city architect of Toronto. Apart from the peculiarity of having a civil engineer as city architect, Mr. McCallum's knowledge of constructional methods and materials should qualify him to pass upon the structural fitness of proposed new buildings, and to decide whether in structures new or old the construction is safe. We presume it is not the intention to place the designing of important city buildings in his hands. If so, why that is a matter requiring entirely different qualifications. The completion and adoption of the proposed new building by-law should follow as a natural sequence the appointment of a city architect. Mr. McCallum should lose no time in urging the City Council to deal with this important matter.

A higher price is asked for this material with the high sounding title on the ground that. the ''water-washing" (whatever that may mean)

ensures a higher standard of quality. Whether such is the fact or not, we cannot but admire the ingenuity exercised in seeking to find a profitable outlet for what would ordinarily be regarded as a valueless product. In this connection it may be mentioned that the lake sand used for building purposes in Toronto varies greatly in quality according to the location from which it is obtained. In some places on the lake shore the sand is clean and sharp, while in others it has a powdery coating which greatly lessens its value when used with lime and renders it altogether valueless if used with cement.

library building. It has also been settled that the reference and circulating libraries shall be housed in one building. This is a wise decision. The best use will be made of Mr. Carnegie's liberal gift by concentrating the expenditure in a well designed and planned building on a site convenient to the business center of the city. If proper care is exercised the building itself will form an interesting addition to the public architecture of the city, while being most convenient of access to a majority of all classes of the citizens.
