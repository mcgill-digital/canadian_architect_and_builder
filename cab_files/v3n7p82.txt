W

ITH the increasing size of Canadian towns and cities and with the growing importance of their leading institutions the question of how to heat and ventilate great public buildings has come more and more to the front as to how that must be settled Especially is this the case with the schools of the country, for the rooms in these buildings are in use almost every day and almost continuously for at least six hours a day, and their occupants are those with whose lives and health we can least afford to trifle. Engineers and sanitarians have long been convinced that the two questions of heating and ventilation were in reality only the two phases of one question, and that to solve one rightly was to solve the other also. Judging by the favor with which it has been received, the system inaugerated by <person>Mr. Smead</person>, and developed and brought into practical use by the firm of Smead, Dowd & Co., answers satisfactorily the public demand in this regard. The firm established a Canadian agency some three years ago, with headquarters in Toronto, and in the short time since then the excellent work done has established for the firm a reputation equal to that it has already gained in the United States, where it stands unsurpassed, if not unrivalled. <person>Mr. Dowd</person>, one of the leading members of this great manufacturing house, gave to a reporter yesterday some facts concerning the apparatus and the extent to which it is in use.

You understand," said Mr Dowd, "that our system is adapted especially to the heating and ventilation of public buildings. We not only warm a room but ventilate it, changing the air in a school room, for instance, from six to eight times every hour. The importance of such a thing in relation to the health of children can hardly be exaggerated One feature of our business that is very gratifying to us is that once our apparatus is tried in a town or by any section of the community and the need arises for a further order we always get the contract. Soon after we established our office in Canada in 1886 we got the contract for the Collegiate Institute in Chat-ham. When the question had to be decided how the new Chatham and Kent county building should be heated the contract was given to us. This building is a very large one, and is now just being completed. In 1887 the Montreal School Board sent a deputation to Toronto to investigate our system, and they were so well pleased with it that they actually cancelled a contract they had made for a hot water apparatus for <building>Victoria School Montreal</building>, then in course of construction, and gave us the contract for the heating system. Next year they placed our apparatus in the <building>Royal Arthur School Montreal</building>, taking out a hot water apparatus which had just been overhauled. Last year they introduced our system in the <building>St. Jean Baptiste Ward School Montreal</building>, and this year they are placing it in a new school in the Hochelaga Ward, and a few weeks ago they gave us the contract to take out the combined hot air and hot water heater in the <building>Anne Street School Montreal</building>and put in our own.

Ottawa is another city in which we have won success, which is most gratifying to us. The School Board sent a deputation to Toronto in 1887 to investigate this matter and, as a result, our system was put in the <building>Percy Street School</building>. This was found to do such satisfactory work that in the following year they adopted it or the Central School West. The Collegiate Institute Board was convinced by the practical results of our work and gave us the contract to take out their steam

heating plant and replace it with our system. In the same year the Separate School Board also gave us a contract for warming and ventilating three of the schools under their charge which had then just been completed. This year we have our third contract with the Public School Board to furnish the appliances for heating and ventilating a new school which is to be erected.

The HamiIton School Board, desiring to be informed upon this question, sent a deputation to Toronto in the spring of 1888 to investigate and report. They were so well pleased with what they learned of our system that they put it in the <building>Picton Street School Hamilton</building>, and, as this practical test resulted satisfactorily, they called upon us to fit up in the same way the <building>Wentworth Street School Hamilton</building>and the <building>Ryerson School Hamilton</building>, two very large buildings The Separate School Board showed their belief in the completeness of our system by ordering an apparatus for a large new school being built this summer.

The School Board of London, Ont., sent a deputation to the United States in 1887 to investigate the various systems of heating and ventilating in use. They adopted our system for the Hamilton Road School In the following y ear they put our apparatus in the new <building>Simcoe Street School London</building>. a very large building costing about $40,000. The work evidently gave satisfaction, for we were given the contract for the Collegiate Institute, which had decided to use our system instead of the hot-air furnace then in use. This year we have contracts from the School Board for the Waterloo North School and the <building>Talbot Street School</building>, and our system has been adopted for two other schools, the apparatus to be put in place this season.

Winnipeg made a trial of our plant last year in the <building>Girls' Central School Winnipeg</building>. The experiment resulted to their satisfaction as well as ours, for we were instructed to place the apparatus in three other schools. We have just received word that our system gives complete satisfaction in every respect. As the temperature last winter went as low as 45 degrees below zero, the test shows that our claim of being able to warm and ventilate a large building in extremely cold weather is fully justified.

In 1886, soon after we established our business in Canada, the Board of Education of Campbellford gave us a contract for the warming of the High School. Last year they built a new school and adopted our system for it. Peterboro gave us a contract last year to place our system in two schools—the North Ward and the South Ward schools—and the reputation that this work has established for us is such that his Lordship Bishop O'Connor gave us the contract for heating a large girl's school which is being constructed there this summer. The authorities in Halifax, N.S, have given the subject of warming and ventilating a great deal of consideration, and this week we have their signatures to a contract to place our heating and ventilating plant in a large fourteenroomed school which is to be built this year.

Of course, our record in Toronto is well known. Our first work here was done in the Brock Avenue school in 1886, and was so satisfactory that we have had the contract for every new school since erected, and for replacing the systems formerly in use in many of the old schools Our system is now in use in over thirty large public school buildings in this city The Toronto School Board about a year ago sent a deputation to the United States to inquire into the subject of school architecture including heating and ventilating. This deputation spent about six weeks in its mission, and visited twenty of the largest cities on the other side of the line. In making their report they concluded with these words

Your committee are unanimous in the opinion that in no one in all the schools visited did we find a system of heating and ventilation superior to the Smead & Co.'s, such as we have in our recently built schools, nor one equal to it in the facilities for the admission of large volumes of fresh air."

"In Windsor, two years ago, we placed our apparatus in the new High School that had just been completed there. This year we were instructed to provide the means for heating and ventilating three new schools which are now in course of construction.

The heating and ventilating of hospitals is a very difficult matter. Our system was adopted for the <building>General Hospital Brockville</building> in Brockville, and in the new <building>Roman Catholic Hospital Peterborough </building>in Peterboro' where the work is about completed. The Protestant Hospital for the Insane in Montreal, a very large building costing over $200,000, also uses our system, and we have just been awarded the contract for the new Nicoll wing of the hospital at Kingston.

In churches we have done considerable work, especially in Toronto. We have our system in nine of the largest churches in the city, including the <building>Trinity Methodist</building>, <building>Cooke's Presbyterian</building>, <building>College Street Baptist</building>, <building>Dovercourt Baptist</building>, the Presbyterian church just completed on the corner

of Bloor and Huron streets, the new <building>Methodist church Parkdale </building>in Parkdale, which is to be opened on the 29th of this month and the Presbyterian church now being erected on Bloor street, to be occupied by the congregation of the old Charles street church.

We have done work in the Dominion from Regina in the Northwest Territories to Canso in Nova Scotia, and in no single case have we had any complaint, and, as I say, when a church board or board of trustees once use our system they take an interest in seeing it adopted for other buildings.

In the United States our system is extensively in use Our apparatus exists in 50 school buildings in Washington city, in more than 20 school buildings in Columbus, Ohio. in every school building in Toledo, Ohio, and in 25 school buildings in Detroit In the last named city the apparatus is now being placed in three large 16roomed school buildings in course of construction

The outlook for our business in Canada this season is better than it has ever been before. We flatter ourselves that we have added an important industry to the many industries of Toronto. We made over a million pounds of iron into castings last year in Canada alone, and the prospect is that this year the output will be considerably larger.

Our dry closet system, which is an important feature of our work, is held by sanitary experts to be better than any system of water closets, especially for use in public buildings. All danger to health is avoided, and there is no chance of any breakage or disarrangement of machinery such as occurs in systems now in use, causing great danger to the health of every occupant of the building."



<article title="Rules Regarding Cement" author="">RULES REGARDING CEMENT.



EMINENT engineers are authority for the following important conclusions

Cold water is probably not injurious, only as it retards setting.

All cements when mixed with sand to a proper consistence for mortar will fall to pieces if placed in water before setting has commenced.

Any American cement of good quality will with one and one-half to two measures of sand give a mortar strong enough for most engineering purposes.

Pressure while setting, with the degree of thoroughness of the mixing or the gauging, the proportion of water used, and other considerations, may easily affect the results one hundred per cent or even much more.

American cement requires less water than Portland.

Sand retards setting, so that cement which, by itself, would set in half an hour, may not do so for some days if mixed with sand

When one part sand is added to one part of cement, the strength is lessened one-half Two parts of sand to one of cement, averages about one-third the strength of pure cement These for tensile and transverse strains.

The crushing strength does not diminish so rapidly.

Slacked lime retards the setting of cement.

After using in air, cement, or cement with sand, should be kept moist or watered until completely hard.

Walls of buildings are often built of cement concrete deposited between smooth-faced planks as a mould, the planks being moved upwards as the work goes on. Cement should be nearly dry and tamped hard.

Post holes running down below frost and tamped full with concrete are safe and economical supports for warehouses and similar buildings

Concrete may be used in large masses under water, and when properly put down, is found good for piers and shore protection.
