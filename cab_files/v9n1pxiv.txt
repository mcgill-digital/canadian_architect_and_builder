Description of the Heydebrand Safety_Window (Patented)



THE Heydebrand Safety Window is so designed that the outside of Both windows can he easily cleaned from the INSIDE of the building, by a person standing on the floor. This can be done by lowering the sash to stationary bearings and revolving them on screw pivots inserted in the side of

each sash, the pivots working in a grooved pulley. THIS WINDOW IS ALSO DESIGNED TO GIVE THE LARGEST POSSIBLE AMOUNT' OF VENTILATION, by lowering both sash to bearings, turning to a horizontal position, and raising to center of frame, thus admitting air through the entire opening.

In making frame, the pulley styles are grooved, the grooves being large enough to admit screw pivots inserted in sash. The grooves so made extend from the top of the frame down, stopping at a point sufficiently high as to allow either or both sash to he revolved on bearings made by ending of groove.

THE Sash SLIDES UP AND DOXVN THE SAME AS IN THE OLD STYLE OF WINDOWS

and can be unhung and taken out, if desired, in much less time than it would take to remove the old style.



ABOVE IS A NEW INVENTION THAT IT WILL PAY ARCHITECTS AND INTENDING BUILDERS TO INVESTIGATE.

XVORKING MODELS can he seen at RICE LEWIS & SON, LIMITED, TORONTO, and JAM ES WALKER & CO., MONTREAL.
