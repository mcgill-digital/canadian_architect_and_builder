	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER



ST. JOHN'S CATHEDRAL, NEWFOUNDLAND.

THE Evening Herald (Newfoundland) gives a description of the reopening of this portion of the cathedral dedicated to St. John the Baptist on June 29, It will be remembered the building was almost entirely destroyed by fire in 1892. Triumphal arches were erected on the occasion of the reconsecration in the thoroughfares leading to the sacred edifice. The work generally has been carried out under the personal direction of Mr. Wills, who acted as clerk of works of the original building, and from the designs of Messrs. George Gilbert Scott, M.A., F.S.A., and John Oldrid Scott, F.S.A., architects, of Springardens, London. Most of the internal fittings are special gifts. The oak eagle

lectern is a reproduction of the burnt one. The carved oak Bishop's throne, sedilia, and stalls which, like the lectern, are entrusted to Messrs. Hems and Sons to carry outâ€”have not yet arrived. There is a handsome new pulpit and altar. The Lord Bishop of Newfoundland was followed into the choir by the rector, rural dean, and a large number of surpliced clergymen. His lordship pronounced the benediction at the altar, font, lectern, and pulpit, and solemnly dedicated the new building and furniture generally.





The Star Iron Co., Limited of Montreal, has recently been incorporated under a Dominion character, to manufacture the heating apparatus.
