<article title=" A SCIENTIFIC WOODEN SKATING RINK " author="">A SCIENTIFIC WOODEN SKATINGR INK.

The building of skating rinks has been carried on in Canada with a considerable degree of enterprise during recent years. The chances of success as a business venture are not always especially encouraging, and altogether too often we discover structures that have been put up without the proper expenditure of money requisite for the amount of ground covered to ensure a safe structure.

it is with pleasure and relief that we find a town of the size of Pembroke furnishing such an excellent example of trussing and general lay out as is shown in the views presented herewith.

The company was started by citizens interested in hockey, and the young men of the town took up most of the stock in $25 and $100 allotments. Mr. J. L.



Morris, CE., Pembroke, prepared the design and superintended the construction.

The total cost amounted to $10,500, the Renfrew Manufacturing Company being the contractors.

The bottom chord of the roof truss is semi-circular to a radins of 48 ft.., and built up of 1.3 planed hoards,  in. x 9 in., bolted together and spiked making a











































































































9 in. x 12 in. chord. The top chord is 9 in. x. 9 in. sold timber. with in. diameter tension rods at each apex point.

These trusses are spaced 13 ft., C to C, for the intermediate bays, and 12 ft. for the end ones, with 16 bays in all, making a total length of 206 ft.

The width of the building out to out of side walls being 100 ft. The height to ridge of roof being 65 ft. There are 2 in. x. S in. purlius spaced 24 inches
