The Ottawa total is $1,636,223; the London total about $1,000,000. The Province seems prosperous as a whole.

Of course Winnipeg's expansion is extraordinary. The actual figures, $10,840,000 for 1905, and $12,-500,000 for 1906, are nearly equal to Toronto. The rate of increase is, however, not so great.

The distinguishing peculiarity of Winnipeg building is the financial institutions which throng there, as the centre from which the money is procured for handling the wheat crop of the west, and for the other operations of an expanding part of the country.

It is evident also that manufacturing is progressing there. Thirty new factories, with values quoted at from $20,000 to $100,000, erected in the present year, seem to cast some doubt upon the doctrine that all the money made in the west is bound to he spent in the east.

The year just closing has been a busy one in the building trades. Yet if the volume of work done is greater than in any previous year, the advance is probably not more than represents the steady and natural growth of the wealth of the city. With so much going on to pave the way to the easier transaction of business by land and sea, there seems every reasonable probability that the past does not give any measure of the future progress.

Of actual buildings completed during the past year, some of the more important are: The <building>Mount Royal Club</building>. the <building>McGill Students' Union</building>. <building>New Sherbrooke Apartments</building>. <building>Hampton Court Apartments</building>, <building>Durocher street Apartments</building>, <building>Jenkins' Building</building>. <building>Lindsay Building</building>, <building>Molsons Bank</building>, St. Catherine St.; <building>Bank of Quebec, Montreal </building>Technical and Commercial High School. <building>Alexandra Hospital</building>. besides a very great number of factories arid of the smaller class of dwellingsâ€”this last to an extent sufficient to affect rents in some degree. New residences of an expensive class are conspicuous by their almost entire absence, one or two in the western part of Dorchester Street being possible exceptions. The suburban class have shown most favour for Westmount and the vicinity; the "Annex" being only a fair second. The factories have settled most thickly in the west, from Guy Street outwards, and have increased to such an extent in the neighborhood of Lachine as to make that settlement into a manufacturing town.

Of buildings in progress the list is large and of an expensive class on the whole. There is the Windsor Hotel Annex. the <firm>Light. Heat & Power Co</firm>.'s Building, <firm>Mark Fisher & Co</firm>. s Building, Royal Bank Head Office, the <building>McIntyre Building</building>. the <building>Linton Apartments</building>, all endeavoring to clothe their steel skeletons with sightlier substance. Other works going on are the <building>Canadian Express Co.'s Buildings</building>, the <building>Notre Dame Hospital</building>. the <building>mother house of the Congregation de Notre Dame</building>. <building>Birks' Building</building>. the <firm>Dominion Guarantee Co</firm>.. St. Catherine Street Postoffice. <building>Bennett's Theatre</building>. La Patrie Offices, <building>Church of the Messiah</building>. <building>Emanuel Congregational al Church</building>. <building>Cavendish Apartments</building>, the Viau Biscuit Factory in the east, and the <firm>American Tobacco Factory </firm>in the west, besides many others.

The prospects for the future are depending as suggested above. a good deal on the question of transportation. There is understood to have been a good deal of thinking done on the subject of a new railroad terminal for the Delaware & Hudson and New York Central lines. The scheme is probably approaching definite crystallization. though the accomplishment will probably occupy years. A new bridge

across the river is implied, and also a large hotel, the location for which, at present under consideration, is the east side of Dominion Square, including the block on which now stand the <building>Y. M. C. A. Building </building>and the <building>Knox Church</building>, The general aim of this terminal is of course to establish more efficient communication with New York. This and the other improvements, in course of construction by the Harbor Commissioners, may be expected to give a great impetus to the trade of the city.

For some years little or no extension has been made to the facilities for getting about from one part of the Island of Montreal to another. Some villages can only be reached by a four-mile drive or walk from the nearest railroad. The <firm>Street Railway Company</firm>, however, propose during the next year to run a line to the ferry opposite St. Vincent de Paul, making that town accessible by a journey of ten miles instead of seventeen, as at present. The Lachine route is to he extended to Dorval. Bordeaux and Bout de 1 'isle are to be brought nearer, and a new line from St. Laurent to St. Genevieve should afford a pleasant Journey to that pleasant village.

Of buildings in prospect for next year may be mentioned the Eastern Township's Bank at the corner of St. James Street and Victoria Square, which is at present a hole in the ground. The Royal Bank has also purchased a site at the south-east corner of St. Catherine and Drummond Streets, presumably with a view to building. Just opposite. a new tenstorey block for Messrs. <firm>Willis & Co</firm>. is projected, to cost about $100,000; a considerable part of the building to be let as offices. Messrs. <firm>Ross & Macfarlane </firm>are designing a new building for the Montreal Sailors' Institute, as an extension to the present premises. A new concert arid music hail is to be built in Berthelet Street, to Mr. <person>R. M. Rodden</person>'s designs The main hall, with its gallery, is to seat 1,200 people. On the ground floor there are to he meeting halls. supper rooms, dressing rooms, etc. The cost is to he in the neigborhood of $50.000. The flervey Institute. at present in Mountain Street, is to be given up and a new building erected at the corner of Claremont Avenue and Windsor Avenue, Westmount. Another Westmount building will be the new school for the Protestant School Commissioners. This is to be on the road on the hill side, between the tops of Lansdowne and Grosvenor Avenues. An annex to the Arena is to stable a hundred horses and provide accommodation for automobile and sportsmen's shows. The present Victoria Skating Rink is to be converted into the New Victoria Music and Concert Hall. to seat from 2,000 to 2,500 persons, with a stage for 300, with the intention of giving grand opera exhibitions and others. Last may be mentioned the new Jail on the Back River.

The <assoc>City Improvements Committee of the P. Q.

A.	A. </assoc>has not made any of its proceedings public for some time. One would like to see public interest in this matter sustained and kept supplied with food for reflection. The scheme at one time announced by the Credit Foncier of erecting a ten-storey building at the corner of St. James Street and St. Lambert Hill has not yet  broken ground. A fine boulevard is projected as a continuation of Sherbrooke Street westwards from Claremont Avenue to beyond Notre Dame de Grace. The idea is to make this 100 feet wide, with separate alley in the centre bordered with trees. the car lines alone being carried between the double line of trees.

A distinct increase has taken place in the employment of reinforced concrete, the largest work in this kind being the American Tobacco Co.'s new factory in St. Anthony Street. The additions now building to the C. P. R. Co.'s station in Osborne Street are mother example and, in Lincoln Avenue, near St. Matthew Street. a row of private houses has been erected with walls floor and roof entirely of concrete. It is not in any case claimed that the first cost of
