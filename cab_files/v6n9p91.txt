THE by-law under which $155,000 was expended in the erection of new County buildings at Woodstock, Ont., has been declared informal, a vote of the ratepayers not having been taken upon it as required by law. A special meeting of the County Council has been Called to frame a new by-law.



THE young architect should be taught to regard the ability to climb a ladder or a series of ladders as one of the essential qualifications t)f his profession. Without this ability he is not in a position to see for himself that the work on the parts of his building which can be reached only by scaling a ladder, is being properly Carried out. Some architects are lacking in this Requirement, and rather than take the chances of a fall, are content to take for granted the quality of the work at the top of the ladders.



THE passenger elevator, which has come to be such a universal and highly appreciated feature of every important office building in America, is but little known in Europe. The disappointment in this respect of the Canadian who visits England and is continually obliged to climb stairs is in inverse ratio to that of the European visitor to Canada, who is delighted to find himself carried from bottom to top of the highest buildings without exertion and within the period of a few seconds.





AMERICAN architects are sharing the burden of the depression which at present exists throughout the United States. In New York, Chicago and other large American cities, the staffs are being greatly reduced in architectural offices. Some Canadian draughtsmen employed in American cities have been so fortunate as to be retained in their situations, whilst others have been deprived of them, and are finding their way back to the Dominion Where, unfortunately, the chances for employment are none too) frequent.



ANOTHER derrick broke down while under strain in Toronto the other day, one of the chains striking and seriously injuring an attendant. The frequency with which accidents of this character have recently occurred should lead contractors to be more careful to see that derricks are sufficiently strong for the work which they are required to perform. If greater care is not exercised the Legislature should step in and protect the lives of workmen. Not alone in Canada but in Great Britain and Australia, accidents from this cause have become frequent, anti the necessity of enforcing greater carefulness in order that they may be avoided is properly engaging attention.





A COMPANY has been formed with the object of erecting a crematory in the City of Toronto. The cost of the building and equipment are placed at about $3,000 A description of the design of the proposed building and of the process of incineration of human bodies, has appeared in the daily press. The amount which is proposed to be risked on the experiment is small, and it is perhaps well for the investors that it is so. The outlook for the success of the venture does not appear to us to be very encouraging. We were recently afforded some particulars concerning the crematory at Buffalo which go to show that the institution has not been a profitable one, the favor bestowed on the new method having been of a very disappointing character. If such has been the result in an American city, there is less reason to expect that so important a departure from established usage will meet with approval in a community where the people are known to be more conservative in their views.
