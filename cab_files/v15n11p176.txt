A Russian nobleman is said to have built of paper a house of 16 rooms upon his estate at Savinowka in Podolia. This house was made in New York, at a cost of 80,000 roubles, and its architect declares that it will outlast a stone building, which is quite creditable when one reflects upon the rapidity with which some of our stonework is disintegrating from the action of rain, frost and heat. Bergen, in Norway, has a church built of paper, capable of seating a thousand people.
