	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER



Important discoveries, says the Plumbers' Review, are often made by accident, and a permanent whitewash was discovered in this way. A few years ago it was decided to whitewash a cellar to make it lighter. For this purpose a suitable quantity of lime was slacked. A workman, who had to carry a vessel of common salt for some other purpose, stumbled over the lime and spilled

some of his salt in it. To conceal all traces of his mishap, lie stirred in the salt as quickly as possible. The circumstance came out afterwards, and this unintentional addition of salt to the lime excited curiosity. On investigation it was found that not only was the whitewash blameless, but it was as hard as cement and would not wash off.
