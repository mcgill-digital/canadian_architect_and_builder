THE DANGER OF	PUTTING STRUCTURES TO NEW USES.



The partial failure of the Brooklyn bridge recently is another evidence of the danger which attends the imposing upon structures of duties which they were not originally designed to fulfill. The designer of this bridge had no thought that electric and cable cars would be run over it, and made no provision for such a contingency. Consequently, as thc result of the extra strain imposed by the street car traffic, some of the rods have snapped, causing a sinking of the roadway, and necessitating the closing of the bridge to traffic. Many accidents from the same cause have happened, causing the collapse of bridges and buildings. It is quite a usual practice to put buildings to uses differing entirely from those for which they were designed, and to impose loads upon the floors many times in excess of those which they were intended to carry. The wonder is that in so many instances they manage to stand thc strain. In view of this practice of overloading, architects should be careful in designing buildings for business uses to employ a factor of safety sufficient to cover all ordinary contingencies of this kind which are likely to arise.



The Ontario Portland Cement Co., Limited, has been formed at Brantford, with a capital of $450,000. The management is in the hands of President, E. L. Gould; Vice-President, W. S. Wisner Secretary, E. Taylor; Directors, H. Cockshutt, A. Bixel, W. G. Elliott and thc president and vice-president. The company propose to utilize marl deposits at Blue Lake, near St. George.
