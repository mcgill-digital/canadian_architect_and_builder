s a branch of sculpture—as the art of cutting a hard body by means of a sharp instrument, and as a term generally

employed in speaking of figures and foilage cut out in ivory or wood in contradistinction to sculpture or figures cut upon metal or stone—the art of carving is of the greatest antiquity It is frequently mentioned in the Bible. The prohibition in the Second Commandment against any graven image evidently refers to it. It was practiced by all the civilized nations of antiquity, and most frequently, in aid of religious observances, images or emblems of diety being created by it both for public and private devotions. Even among the most uncivilized tribes who have any external religious rites, rude representations of this kind are common. In Catholic countries carved images of saints and relics are still used both for churches and for private devotion. Besides this almost universal use, carving was early employed for purposes of ornament. Many eastern nations have excelled in it. India and China have long been famed for their artistic skill both in wood and ivory, particularly the latter. The ancient Babylonians practiced the art among other purposes in the carving of heads for staffs and signet rings, In the family of Abraham, who was a Chaldean, these ornaments appear according to some allusions to have been preserved. The pledges which Judah gave to Tamar include the shaft and the signet ring. Among the Greeks, statues of the gods carved in wood and overlaid, were common at an early period. At a later period plates of ivory were used for overlaying statues, and were also largely employed for smaller ornamental work. In the early and middle ages, wood carving became general for the decoration of Christian Churches and altars. One of the most ingenious and useful purposes to which carving has been converted in more modern times, is that of engraving wood cuts for printing. These have been applied to almost innumerable uses in manufactures as well as art Some of these applications have given way to the art of engraving in metal and other processes, but new ones are continually arising. One of the latest developments of the art of carving is the invention of carving by machinery. A patent was taken out in 1829 by Mr. Joseph Gibbs, for the cutting of ornamental forms in low relief. These were executed with great accuracy, and were used in ornamenting the floors of Buckingham palace, London, England. A machine, the principle of which has not been made public, has since been used successfully by Mr. Cheverton, for obtaining miniature reductions of life sized statuary. A machine patented in 1845 by Mr. Jorday, is caduced, so far as that is possible, by revolving tools ; the finish is afterwards given to carvers to finish by hand labor. This machine was used for the carving decorations of the interior of the Houses of Parliament, England.



The spring exhibition of paintings, water-color drawings statuary, architectural designs, stained glass, etc., held under the auspices of the Montreal Art Association is now in progress.

A lovely parlor in light hues, on a ground scale, is arranged as follows The floor is inlaid in oak and natural cherry, and the walls have the palest tint of pink watered-silk paper, with a frieze of roses on a pale-blue ground, and cornice of pink, blue, and gold. The ceiling is in cream-color with gold stars sprinkled over it and a square panel of roses in the centre. The slender crystal and gold chandelier has pink candles.



We are indebted to the municipal authorities of Kansas City, Mo., for a copy of the annual report of Mr. <person>W. B. Everhart</person>, Superintendent of Buildings, of that city. In addition to the number, value, etc., of new buildings erected during the year 1888 the report contains statistics showing the volume of business done during the year, some of the engravings of principal buildings, and other interesting and valuable matter.
