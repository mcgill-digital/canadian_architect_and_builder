A rule to determine the ready quantity of paint required to cover any structure, says the Plumber and Decorator, is as follows Divide I the number of square feet of surface by 200, the quotients will lie the number of gallons of liquid paint required for two coats. Or, divide the area in square feet by t8, and the result is the number of pounds of pure white lead required to give three coats, where this pigment is permissible.
