AN experienced architect who recently The Cost of Remodell- remodelled an important public building Old Buildings.

ing, using a large quantity of the original cut stone and brick work, states that the ultimate cost of the work was several thousands of dollars in excess of what would have been required to put up an entirely new structure. It is safe to say that this statement would apply to a large proportion of the old buildings which have been remodelled. Nor have the results usually been satisfactory, because the architect was hampered by having to conform in large measure to the plan of the old building. Taking down, cleaning and replacing old stone and brickwork is a much more costly operation than owners of old buildings imagine it to be.



ATTENTION is specially called to the announcement appearing in the Students' Department of this number regarding a competition for students and draughtsmen. The sole object of this competition is to encourage and benefit Canadian students of architecture. It has been remarked that the students of the present day in Canada do not display as great ambition or put forth as much effort to achieve success as did the students of eight or ten years ago. Our own experience in connection with recent students' competitions seems to bear out this

Students'

Competition.
