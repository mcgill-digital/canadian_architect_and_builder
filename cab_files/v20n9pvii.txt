CANNED PAINTINGS.

Canvas paintings may now be preserved under glass indefinitely, it is said. The method of preservation is simple. The canvas is placed in a vacuum, where it is preserved, like fruit, being sealed up from all the destructive influences of the atmosphere.

Had the men of old known this, the pictures of Apelles might still live in the first freshness of their colors, and the work of Raphael and Michael Angelo would look to-day as it looked when it left the painters' hands.



The Dominion Trades and Labor Council met in Winnipeg recently for a four days' convention, beginning September 10.
