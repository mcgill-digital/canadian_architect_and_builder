THE annual exhibition of the <assoc>Toronto Art Students' League</assoc>, occurring almost simultaneously with the appearance of their highly decorative calendar for 1894, brings prominently before the literary and artistic public, the existence of an institution which has been quietly working its way upward, and which, in very many respects holds a unique place among the art organizations of our country. Its history is neither very long nor very eventful. It is a story of steady unobtrusive development by a healthy natural growth from a small beginning to a sturdier and maturer vigor.

On September, 22nd, 1886, a circular was sent forth by Mr.

<person>A.	H. Howard</person> to the artists and art students of the city, calling them to a meeting for the formation of a club, which, relying on the added strength that comes from union, should be in a position to afford better opportunity for the prosecution of art studies than could be secured by any individual action. The date fixed for the meeting was Friday evening, Sept. 24th, and the place a little room at 56 King street east, kindly loaned by Mr.

<person>0.	R. Hughes</person>, and at that time and place the alt faithful gathered together. It was by no means a large, and perhaps not a particularly awe-inspiring assemblage. The room was an upper room, and according to the story of some who were there,

it was very decidedly "upper,'

Thomson</person>, <person>Parker Newton</person> and <person>0. P. Staples</person>. The usual resolutions were drawn up and carried unanimously, of course, and the life of the League dates from that meeting.

According to Mr. Howard's first notice, sketching from life was to be a special feature of the club's work, and, in addition to this, a paper had been prepared by Mr. Manly outlining a scheme for the carrying on of a series of monthly sketches on given subjects suited to the requirements of landscape and figure men. The meeting adopted these two features as the foundation upon which the club should build. Provision was made for supplying a model's "throne" and a model's own reflector lamp ; several other lamps were added to the one already in their possession, and in a new brilliance as befitted a lover of light rather than darkness, the infant League set out on the straight and narrow path of art.

Someone had to send out notices and write minutes, and Mr. Hughes was made secretary; some one had to hold the money, and Mr. Howard was made treasurer a president would only be in the way, and none was appointed.



For a time there were many tips and downs, with apparently a majority in favor of the "downs." Models continually failed to keep appointments and when they did appear insisted on being paid, coal-men clamored, the landlord had to be satisfied, and the frequently recurring minute " Resolved that members be urgently requested to pay all arrears of fees" seems to suggest an impending financial embarrassment. The rough places, however, gradually became smooth and the general state of affairs soon assumed a more hopeful aspect.

On April 1st, 1889, the institution removed to its present rooms in the Imperial Bank building, Leader Lane, and with its removal it cast off the most unsatisfactory features of the Bohemianism that had held a dominant place in its old habitation. With an increase in membership, accompanied by a corresponding increase in the financial receipts. it was in a position to make its new abode comfortable with a plentiful supply of light and heat, to procure additional furnishings and provide for

drawing from the life several evenings a week instead of one as before. An elaborate constitution was framed and Mr. Blatchly was elected the first president. Mr. Blatchly successfully fulfilled the duties of this position until 1890, when he withdrew and was succeeded by Mr. Win. Thomson, who in turn withdrew in 1891 and was succeeded by Mr. R. Holmes. The management of the business is vested in an executive committee of eleven members elected annually on the first Tuesday in March.

The committee for the present year is composed of: Mr. R. Holmes, President ; Mr. J. I). Kelly, Vice-president ; <person>Miss J.

M.	F. Adams</person>, Treasurer; <person>Mr. W. W. Alexander</person>, Cor. Secretary Mr. <person>F. H. Brigden</person>, Rec. Secretary ; Miss <person>G. E. Spurr</person>, Chairman House Committee Mr. <person>W. D. Blatchly</person>. Chairman School Committee ; Mr. <person>J. Willson</person>, Chairman Library Committee.



The League is a co-operative concern. All members share alike in meeting the expenses and enjoying the privileges. There are no paid officers or instructors The membership fees are, for men, $3.00 for entrance and $2.00 per month during the eight working months of the year ; and $2.00 entrance and $1.50 per month for ladies ; and the amount received goes to pay itinerant expenses. The treasurer is instructed to make a reserve sufficient to meet expenses of the summer months, and if any surplus remains, the library or the house-furnishings or the models' wardrobe derives the benefit of it. The institution is first and foremost a life-class, and seems to have set itself firmly in the one resolve, unalterable as the laws of the Medes and Persians, that it shall draw directly from the life, and if necessary every other consideration must bend in obedience to the carrying out of this line of action.

The life-class meets always three evenings a week and frequently as often as five evenings a week, and a programme is laid out, providing for about an equal number of nude and costume studies. For some time considerable difficulty was experienced in securing suitable models, and many are the funny stories told of models who prided themselves on their physique because it tipped the scale at two hundred pounds This difficulty has, however, been largely overcome by a system of persistently paying the best prices and demanding the best service, and during last year out of nearly one hundred evenings there were only three occasions

when models failed to keep their appointments, and their places had to be taken by volunteers

The series of monthly compositions still remains a most important feature of the League's programme of work. The life-class is intended to supply the means of obtaining an intimate acquaintance with the form, proportions and construction of the figure, together with a knowledge of the textures of drapery rind the folds it assumes under varying conditions ; and an acuteness of perception, an accuracy of drawing and a facility in the
