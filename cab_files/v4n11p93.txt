THE architect and decorator desirous of learning how to secure the most pleasing color effects, might profitably have spent a few of the latter days of October in studying autumn foliage in its unusually varied and brilliant aspects



WE have been informed that previous to the publication of the October number of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, a misapprehension existed in the minds of many as to who was the author of the design of <building>St. Paul's Episcopal Church Toronto</building>. We are pleased to know that unwittingly we were the means of removing this misconception, and of placing the credit of the design where it properly belongs.





WE would like to point out to the late secretary of the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Sketch Club</assoc>, who is now a resident of the " Ambitious City,' a worthy object of ambition. It is that he seek to establish among the architectural students of Hamilton an organization similar to those now existing in Toronto and Montreal There should be sufficient material available for the purpose, and <person>Mr. Bond</person>enthusiasm and ability might be depended on to do the rest.



 MUCH loss is said to have been caused the builders of Winnipeg by a recent strike of union plumbers. A local paper slates that the employers signed an agreement to pay journeymen $4



per day after the 1st of August last, but when the time came, they claimed to be unable to carry out their promise on account of one shop in the city employing unqualified workmen at low wages. If this is the only reason the employers have to offer for the non-fulfillment of their written agreement, we unhesitatingly say that it is not a justifiable one.





THE Inspector of Buildings and the chief of the fire brigade have recently been engaged in making an examination of the public buildings of Toronto, with a view to determining whether sufficient means of exit exist. Their report has not vet been published but from private sources it is learned that some buildings in which large congregations of visitors daily assemble, have been found to be dangerous in this particular The last Inspection of this kind took place in 1879. The public safety demands that for the future such inspection should be conducted at more frequent intervals.





RIGHTEOUS	indignation has been aroused at the action of the <firm>Consumers Gas Co.</firm> in tearing tap the asphalt pavement recently constructed on Bay St., Toronto, for the purpose of laying mains on the intersecting street. Citizens were tinder the impression that no interference with permanent pavements of this character would be allowed, otherwise they would not have consented to be heavily taxed for the improvement. The large sums spent of late on asphalt pavements in Montreal and Toronto will prove to have been wasted if corporations of any kind are allowed to break rip the roadway. Heavy penalties should follow any future attempts in this direction.



A GOOD report reaches us from Hamilton concerning the plumbers of that city, to the effect that their work is of a uniformly higher grade than can be found in most of the cities on this continent. However this may be, some work which we recently had the opportunity to examine in houses of moderate cost in that City, is certainly very creditable, while the materials and fittings used are of a substantial character and superior finish. There can be no doubt about the wisdom of sacrificing, if need be, exterior ornamentation for the purpose of making this as perfect as possible in its sanitary appointments. We are informed that Hamilton has become too warm a place for the " skin plumber " to n-take a living in ,an d that in consequence the architects feel that they can entrust their work to any of the existing firms with confidence that it will be carried out as satisfactorily by one as by another. This must be admitted to be a gratifying condition of affairs.
