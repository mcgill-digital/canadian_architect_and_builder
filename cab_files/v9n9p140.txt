with water. The heat was then raised slowly to a temperature of 1075, and the column, which showed a



dull redness," was again quenched with water. The heat was then raised again to 1,300 and the column, which now showed a '' bright red," was again quenched with water. The column was beginning to yield by bending just before the last application of the water. The column was apparently unaffected by water, although it failed by bending under the load, the same as in cases 3 and 4.

COLUMN TEST NO	

I.- FIRE TEST WITHOUT WATER.

STEEL COLUMN.



MAY 19, 1896.

The walls of the furnace were of common brick, as described, and the door was closed with a double thickness of sheet iron, which made the opening practically tight. The column was a Carnegie steel box-channel, of the dimensions as shown in the diagram (Fig. 2), and was unprotected.



The weather was clear and warm, with only a slight breeze from the west. Temperature of the air So Fahr., in the shade. The gas producer was fired the day before, with valve closed against furnace. The packing in the hydraulic cylinder leaked and a fitting of the pipe gave out as test started. These causes delayed the use of the water pressure.

The column would have failed sooner if the working load of So tons could have been used.

The result of the test is shown in the flashlight photograph (Fig. 3) taken of the column before it was disturbed. After the column was removed from the furnace the photograph (Fig. 4) was taken. The brick walls cracked, as is shown in photograph (Fig. 5), the greatest damage taking place where one wall was bonded into the next and the cracks at these places extended through the bricks. Along the horizontal joints the walls cracked most on the bond courses. All the walls were hot, the eight-inch wall being too hot to hold the hand in contact with it.
