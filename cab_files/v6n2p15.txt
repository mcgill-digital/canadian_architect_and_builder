WE have received many Compliments from subscribers and advertisers upon the character of the New Year Number of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER publisher last month, for which we return our sincere thanks.



SOME Toronto architects and contractors, acting upon the suggestion printed in these columns soon after the conflagration which destroyed the city of St. John's Nfld., have visited the colony, and secured a considerable amount of work. Canadian manufacturers are also supplying large quantities of materials, which are being employed in the rebuilding of the city.



REPRESENTATIVES of the <assoc>Toronto Builders' Exchange </assoc>recently waited upon the members of the Ontario Government and presented arguments in support of needed amendments to the Mechanics' Lien Act. It is to be hoped that at the coming session of the Legislature an effort will be made to simplify the Act and render more equitable its provisions.



THERE is reason to protest against the unfair treatment which is frequently accorded to non-resident contractors who, in response to public advertisements inviting tenders, submit bids for municipal works. A thoroughly responsible contractor of Hamilton recently sent in the lowest tender for the supply of certain iron pipe required by the city of Toronto, and was given the contract. Subsequently, we believe, a pretext was found for taking the work from him and giving it to a local firm. Since then a contract for paving has been awarded to a Toronto contractor by the Board of Works of Hamilton, and pressure is being brought to bear on behalf of local contractors with the object of depriving him of it. This is a most unjust way of doing bust ness. Either let it be publicly understood that no outside contractor need expect to get the work, regardless of what may be his ability to perform it as satisfactory and at less cost than local contractors, or else let each tender, by whomsoever submitted, be considered entirely on its merits. Circumstances should in most instances enable the local contractor to the work more cheaply than an outsider, but If notwithstanding this advantage, the estimate of the outsider should be the lowest, and his ability to carry out the work equally unquestionable, he most t certainly should receive the contract.



THE question as to the best course to be pursued in the erection of the new city and county buildings in Toronto, has been under the serious consideration of the City Council and the architect for several weeks past. The Council have been advised by their solicitor that they are powerless under the terms of the contract to interfere in any. way with the architect in any course of action which he may see fit to pursue. On the other hand the opinion is expressed that so long as the city authorities refrain from attempting to direct the architect's course, no responsibility will attach to the city for his conduct. The city's solicitor deems it improbable that the courts would in any event order that the present contractor for the work be entrusted with its completion, but that he should be otherwise compensated for any damages to which he may be found to be entitled. The Council at their last meeting adopted a resolution in which the opinion was expressed, that while fully protecting the interests of the city, the architect should at once take such steps as would insure the resumption of building operations at the earliest moment in the spring. The situation undoubtedly requires the most cautious procedure on the part of the architect in order to avoid the
