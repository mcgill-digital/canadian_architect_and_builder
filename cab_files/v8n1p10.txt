Returns from the City Registry Office for the year just closed showed the total number of mortgages recorded during the year to be 2,133, and the aggregate amount of incumbrances, $6,188,

449.	The city, for the purpose of registry, is divided into the eastern and western divisions and the returns show that there were 213 more mortgages recorded in the eastern than in the western division, and a difference in the amount loaned of

What is the outlook for 1895? This is a question that seemed difficult to answer up to the first few days of the new year. Architects could not report that any large business was ahead of them. There have been talked-of operations in different lines. A million dollar hotel for Toronto has been named, and will be considered at a public meeting to be held this month, but whether it will go on, it is a hard matter to say. It would certainly add encouragingly to the work of the year. It is unnecessary to say that every citizen was pained to learn on Sunday 6th inst. of the disastrous fire that swept away the <building>Globe building</building>, the <building>McKinnon warehouse </building>and other valuable properties in the business part of the city, and they were appalled when on Thursday night it came to their knowledge that a second immense fire had broken out, and before its ravages could be stayed that a number of Large wholesale warehouses, in the vicinity of Melinda, Wellington and Bay streets had been destroyed. The total loss in buildings from the two fires will represent nearly $1,000,000. With hardly an exception it is to be expected that these buildings will be rebuilt. This, of course, will mean an unexpected increase to building activities in 1895.

<article title="Ottawa, Ont." author="">OTTAWA, ONT.



The greatest dullness in building circles prevailed in Ottawa during 1894, and the business done showed a marked decline over that of 1893. Few new buildings were erected. The work lone consisted principally of structural remodeling of old buildings. The work of greater importance that may be specially named is as follows: <building>Young Women's Christian Association</building>, $15,000 <building>Maternity hospital, Ottawa, Ont.</building>, $7,000; Grant's block, $18,000

Stavis' block, $ 11,000; <building>Hayter Reed's house</building>, $16,000; St. Andrew's church, improvements, $5,000, together with certain additions to the <building>Windsor Hotel</building>, the <building>Bank of Ottawa</building>, and alterations in the Perley block. The main work done throughout  the year was under the direction of <firm>Arnoldi & Calderon</firm>, <person>G. M. Bayley</person>, <person>F. J. Alexander</person>, <firm>Gregg & Gregg</firm>, <person>William Hodgson</person>, <person>M. C. Edey </person>and <person>James Mather</person>. There appears to have been little, if any, difference between the cost of building materials in 1894 and 1893, and prices for labor have remained about the same. With a few insignificant exceptions the principal material used in building has been local stone and brick. Ottawa s not a place where speculative building is indulged in to any alarming extent, and yet each year a number of cheaply finished dwellings are erected by contractors on speculation, meeting, seemingly, the requirements of a certain class of the population. Time alone will tell what 1895 will bring forth ; as yet no new work is in view.

<article title="Hamilton, Ont." author="">HAMILTON, ONT.



The total value of permits issued in Hamilton for 1894 was $464,832, against $471,768 in 1893, showing a decline of only

$7,136. It may, therefore, be said, that despite dull times the Ambitions City has held its own better than many other cities in the Dominion. The work completed has shown a goodly increase in residential buildings, with 18 business buildings and 4 public buildings. Among the latter can be included two schools, at a cost of $20,000 each, Mr. <person>A. W. Peene </person>and Mr. <person>W. A. Edwards </person>being the architects; House of Refuge, $22,000, <person>R. H. Barber</person>, architect; addition to <building>St. Joseph's Hospital, </building>$12,000, <person>R. Clopecy</person>, architect. The larger part of the work of 1894 was undertaken by the following contractors:

<firm>Halliday & Webber</firm>, <person>G. H. Mills</person>, <person>R. Press, </person><firm>Wark & White </firm>and <firm>Hannan & Jacques</firm>. The cost of building materials in 1894 was considerably less than in 1893. Labor, skilled and unskilled, commanded about the same price as a year previous. Not a little of the prosperity of Hamilton during 1894, and this likely explains the increase in the erection of residential buildings, is due to the Hamilton smelting works, located in the outskirts of the city, a concern employing a large number of workmen. Architects and builders look forward to a prosperous year in 1895.

<article title="London, Ont." author="">LONDON, ONT.



Building operations in London for the years 1893 and 1894 have run about parallel with each other. The more important buildings erected in 1894 were: <building>St. Paul's Cathedral</building>, at a cost of $50,000; <building>First Presbyterian Church, </building>$25,000; remodeling the Huron and <building>Erie Savings and Loan Building </building>at an expenditure of $15,000. These buildings were designed by <firm>Spiers & Rohns</firm>, of Detroit, Mich. <firm>Tainbling & Jones </firm>were contractors of the first named building, <person>E. Martyn </person>and <person>W. Tytler </person>of the second, and <person>J. Haymon </person>and <firm>Jones Bros. </firm>of the third. A large amount of residence building was done during 1894 and of a character that reflects credit on <firm>Moore & Henry</firm>, <person>H. C. McBride</person>, <person>J. A. Gauld </person>and <person>George Craddock</person>, home architects. It is to be noted that the heavier work of the year has fallen to American architects, and this disposition on the part of the people of London has been further aggravated in awarding the designs for the new <building>Free Library buildings </building>to Mr. <person>C. C. Haight</person>, of New York, though he has since established himself in business in London. Why should this be so with talent of the first order at home? The money that goes to pay for such edifices as St. Paul's Cathedral, the Presbyterian church and the Loan Society comes from the people of London. Prices of material during 1894 were considerably less than in 1893. The labor market has remained about the same. The prospects in building for 1895 are exceedingly encouraging.

<article title="Owen Sound, Ont." author="">OWEN SOUND, ONT.



The growing town of Owen Sound in 1894 did not fall behind the year previous in building operations, the figures for both years running about $35,000. The most noteworthy feature has been the erection of a considerable number of residential buildings of the decidedly better class. Only one business block of importance was erected in 1894. Brick and limestone trimmings have predominated in material employed. Prices of material were about the same in 1894 as in 1893. An unhealthy feature of the building trades has been the disposition in many cases to take work at abnormally low prices. Some contracts of the year were undoubtedly taken at a loss. This may be considered a good thing for the capitalist who is putting his money into
