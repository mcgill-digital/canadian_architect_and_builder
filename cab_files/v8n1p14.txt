"C. A. & B." COMPETITION FOR A <building>MUSKOKA

COTTAGE.

</building>

T

HE judges in the above competition have submitted the following report

"Although a great many designs have been submitted, this competition is not at all satisfactory. The

competitors have exercised the greatest freedom in the interpretations  of the conditions, but in spite of this not one of them has produced anything approaching an ideal "Muskoka Cottage."

"Ye Olde" has been placed first because in this design alone some artistic skill is evinced in the treatment of the elevations, but the planning is very weak. No advantage has been taken of the variation in levels in the site, and the avowed purpose of enclosing the walls of the two elevations not shown with siding, cannot be too strongly condemned.

"Rearing our temple let it be our pride

Nought to neg1ec, but build with patient care.

A perfect building, finished everywhere

Not a mere facade with one good side.'



A 12x22 room without a fireplace and with a stair and four doors opening off it, is not a "generous living room" for a Muskoka cottage, and the pantry would be very much better between dining room and kitchen. The 10x10 room with a stair reducing the height of one side to 4 ft. 6 in., lighted only from a window overlooking the front verandah, and labelled "bedroom," would be of very little use for that purpose, and there are not enough closets.

"Bydand" gets 2nd place by the ingenious manner in which he plans his bedrooms, but the verandah is much too narrow and would be much better without the rise of three steps at the west end. This difference in level, while it prevents an entrance to the verandah at the ground level, has the effect of reducing the privacy of the front bedroom. The fireplace in living room is very badly placed, and this room would be much better for a window unshaded by the verandah. The arrangement of doors to kitchen and pantry is bad.

"Eureka," which takes 3rd place, is unquestionably the most carefully thought out plan submitted, and would, but for the silly affectation of symmetry, in showing two stairs from the living room, both landing in the same spot on first floor and balancing the porch by the cloak room, have taken a better place. The idea of giving the whole of the ground floor to the living room  verandah, and taking advantage of the hillside site to get the kitchen department at a lower level is good and well adapted to the requirements of Muskoka life, but it would be better to have the dumb waiter larger, so that it could act as a sort of moveable pantry, as this would enable the removal of dishes, &c., from the living room after meals to be effected very rapidly and easily. The fireplace alcove is too near the door, and the cloak room too far from it. The bedroom floor is well planned, but a bath-room is hardly necessary in a Muskoka summer cottage. The flat roof would be an excellent place for a dance on a moonlight evening. Although excessively ugly, praise is due for the frank way in which the elevations are treated, and the drawing is good.

"Rosseau" comes in a good fourth, with a good verandah but very poor living room. The fireplace between the stairs and pantry door is utterly useless, and the cutting off of the internal corners of the living room is childish. The "den" would be better treated as a simple alcove off the living room. The bedroom floor is fairly well planned, but would be better if the little triangular closet were left out and the N. W. bedroom finished like the N. E.

"Gravenhurst" submits a simple plan, substituting dining room, reception hall and sitting room for the living room called for, but all the windows to these rooms are shaded by the verandah and the proportions of the elevations are not good. A fireplace and chimney built of boulders as shown in the section would be cumbersome and difficult to keep clean.

"Hunter" has a very good arrangement for his earth closet and the kitchen and pantry are fairly well arranged, but both living room and verandah are poor, and the bedrooms are not sufficiently lighted.

"Ken ozsha" has a good living room but very poor verandah. The space between kitchen and ground floor bedroom would have been much better as one good pantry than cut up as it is. The bedroom floor plan is good, but rather too much space is devoted to the hall.

The work submitted, with perhaps the single exception of "Ye Olde," points to a familiarity on the part of the students with second rate examples of American design, but evinces little or no knowledge or study of the principles of true architecture, and we would advise the students to direct their attention to the study of better examples of architectural design. Osbourne' s House Planning gives the principles of domestic planning in a very concise form, and examples of skilful and artistic design for small houses are to be found in plenty in the pages of the "Builder,"" Building News," and other similar publications.

Most of the drawings submitted might, for any evidence of artistic knowledge they contain, have obtained their motive from some of the publications issued by the "Co-operative Building Plan Association" or other similar institutions, and if "the budding architect" cannot produce better work than this, the public can hardly be expected to go to the expense of architectural services for buildings of this sort.

<article title="Bearing Power of Foundations" author="">BEARING POWER OF FOUNDATIONS.



FROM the valuable note-book of Mr. <person>E. L. Corthell</person>, of the <assoc>Western Society of Engineers, </assoc>we have been pern~itted to extract the following data respecting the bearing power of foundations.

CIay.—From 2 to 8 or 9 tons per square foot, without allowance for friction.

Sand.—The different kinds vary greatly in bearing power Sand mixed with loam will not bear more than 5 tons per square foot. 9.3 tons per square foot were placed on fine gravel and sand at Urk viaduct masonry piers on cylinders 4.8 inch diameter; friction neglected.

In India, on coarse sand in deep foundations, not over 9 tons are used.

In experiments 20 tons have been put on sand without measurable settlement.

Friction.—Side friction varies from 200 to 600 pounds per square foot.

All the above are in gross tons=2,240 pounds.—<person>B. Baker </person>April 17, 1888

Clay.—Black Friars Bridge, 5 tons per square foot. Settled badly.—<person>Randall Hunt</person>, Engineering and Building Record, June 23, 1888

New London Bridge, 5 tons per square foot on piles,=80 tons per pile. Settled badly.

Newcastle-on-Tyne, 1 1/2 tons per square foot; no settlement.

Fargo, Dakota, four-story building, 2 1/2 tons per square foot; failed. Then 1 1/2 tons per square foot; no settlement.

Cleveland, new viaduct, to 1.7 tons per square foot.

Washington Monument, 9 tons per square foot, inside edge. Clay and sand, 3 tons per square foot, outside edge.

Sand.-—Coney Island pier, 5 tons per square foot.

<firm>New York Steam Company</firm>chimney, 4 tons per square foot on fine sand; settled.

Brooklyn Bridge anchorage, 4 tons per square foot.

Nantes Bridge, 6.8 tons per square foot; settled.

Berlin, considered safe, 2.3 tons per square foot.

Sometimes used to 4.1 tons per square foot.

Albany Capitol, 2 tons per square foot; settled.

Cairo Bridge, fatigue weight:

Channel piers, 3.34 tons per square foot.

River Piers, 33.08 tons per square foot.

Friction on sides taken at 4,000 pounds per square foot; fine sand.

Sioux City, Pier III ; sand, 2.64 tons per square foot.

Soft Soil.—India, one ton per square foot used.—Journal of Engineering.
