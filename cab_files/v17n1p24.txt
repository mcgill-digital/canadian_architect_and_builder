For the different shades of blue, different proportions of cobalt. For a very light shade of blue for spectacles, a mixture of cobalt and red oxide of iron. London smoke is obtained by mixture of the oxides of copper, iron, and manganese. A black is produced by increasing the proportions of these three oxides. Purple glass has for coloring element oxide of manganese. A glass so colored and made with soda gives a purple shade, edging on the red, while a potash glass will give a bluish purple.
