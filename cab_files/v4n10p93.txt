THE Ontario Association of Architects have had two competitions with the object of securing a suitable design for an Association seal. The results in both cases have been unsatisfactory. Here was the opportunity for some of the younger men in the profession to distinguish themselves. It is to be regretted that no one with the necessary ambition and ability could be found to take advantage of it.





<assoc>THE American Institute of Architects </assoc>will hold its twenty-fifth annual convention in the city of Boston on the 28th, 29th and 30th of the present month. It is announced that a number of valuable papers have been prepared for the occasion. There will also be an interesting exhibition of architectural drawings under the direction of the Boston Chapter. The occasion will in all probability be marked by a large attendance.



IT has been found for the present impossible to complete the tests of Canadian building stones recently undertaken at the School of Practical Science, Toronto, by the Ontario Association of Architects, owing to the incapacity of the testing machine. The authorities of the School have under construction a machine with double the capacity of the one at present in use. This machine, which will have a crushing capacity of 200 tons, is expected to be available within a month, when the series of tests will be completed, and the results in detail published.



ATTENTION is again directed to the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER'S competition for students of the Ontario and Province of Quebec Associations of Architects, which was announced in the September issue of this paper. It is earnestly hoped that a large number of students in the offices of members of both Associations will feel called upon to enter this competition and do their utmost to uphold the credit of their respective provinces. If this is done, the result will no doubt prove of much interest and value, and sufficiently encouraging to induce the holding of other competitions with a similar object.



A PERUSAL of the competitive advertisement columns of some of our contemporaries is occasionally refreshing (or depressing ?). Here are two samples which are a little out of the ordinary type. Designs for a county jail in Wisconsin are wanted and the authorities "promise and agree to pay a reasonable price for plans and specifications which the committee may adopt." Possibly the ideas in regard to a reasonable price as entertained by the aforesaid committee will be very far from those of the poor deluded architects who may submit designs. A California school board offers a premium of $100 for plans and specifications of a $2,500 building. Truly, if a premium of 4 per cent. is offered for this amount of work the place must be an Eldorado for architects. But we hope no young Canadian will be tempted to go west on the strength of the offer.



THE City Improvement Board of Sydney, New South Wales, are of the opinion that " it should be compulsory for designs of buildings to be submitted to some competent body for approval, not only for aesthetic reasons and to secure some general harmony of character and design in contiguous edifices, but also to regulate the nature and class of buildings that should be permitted in particular localities." There is need for something to be done in this direction, not only in South Wales, but also in Canada. The practicability of carrying the proposal into effect may, however, be doubted. It would be difficult to secure
