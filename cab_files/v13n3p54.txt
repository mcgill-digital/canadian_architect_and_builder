	     In 1897	Pig Iron.	  Steel.

	United States	9,652,680	7,156,957

	Great Britain	8,789,455	4,585,961

	Germany and Luxembourg... 6,879,541	5,119,300

	All Others	7,615,814	4,157,643

	32,937,490	21,019,861



A writer in a recent number of The Spectator stated that he considered Germany was in more dread of the United States as a commercial competitor than Great Britain, This statement is borne out somewhat by the above figures as the iron market has oftentimes been called the barometer of trade. These notes on the iron industry will no doubt be of special interest at the present time when Canadians are looking forward to the day when the large iron and steel works at Sydney, Cape Breton, will be turning out over 300,000 tons of pig iron annually. The whole of Canada only produced 53,000 tons of pig iron and 18,000 tons of steel in 1897, so that one can judge from these figures the importance to Canada of this enterprise. Canadians will no doubt be proud that their own country will then be able to supply her mills with pig iron instead of being obliged as at present, to look to others for the supply of this most important material.



II. —COPPER.



This metal is very widely distributed, rich deposits having been found in various parts of the world. It is generally obtained from its ore by what is known as the dry or pyre metallurgical method, that is, if containing more than 414402f copper. When the ore contains under this amount it is usually obtained by the hydro metallurgical or wet method. The dry process is the one usually employed, and consists of roasting, calcining and refining, as many as 6 and oftentimes

different processes being gone through to convert the ore into good copper.

Copper is found in a few cases in the metallic state (when it is termed " native copper ") hut more often in some combination of oxides, sulphides or carbonates. The yellow sulphide commonly known as " pyrites

being probably the most common. The world's production of this metal for 1889, 1893 and 1897 was as follows

	Europe	81,613	88,922	 88.828

	North America... 1 10,674	158,553 239,679

	South America... 31,983	27,220	25,300

	Asia	16,125	18,000	23,000

	Australia	11,582	6,667	17,322

	Africa	. 7,860	6,090	7,440

	259,837	305,452	401,569



This table clearly shows that North America has nearly 6057216710f the world's production to her credit while the table following shows that the United States alone has over 504575200f the world's product of copper

	United States	220,571 tons.

	Canada	 5,938

	Newfoundland	  1,800

	Mexico	 11,370 "



Total North America. .239,679



The chief districts in the United States where copper ore is found are Montana, Lake Superior district and Arizona. The chief foreign producer is Spain, the world famed Rio Tinto mine alone producing in 1897 nearly 34,000 tons of copper.

	III.	LEAD.



There is hilt one ore of lead that is of any commercial importance, the sulphide (Pb. S.) which is more commonly known as galena. It is usually associated in greater or less quantities with silver, and when the silver is in paying quantities the ore is generally termed argentiferous galena. The silver is not hard to separate and when over 3 oz. to the ton is generally separated. The theory of smelting lead is as follows The sulphide is converted into either the oxide or sulphate and then fused with a quantity of unchanged ore which yields metallic lead and sulphurous acid.

Galena is well distributed, the chief producing countries being the United States, Germany, Mexico and Great Britain, in the order mentioned. The United States produced ;n 1897, 192,000 tons, while Spain, the next largest producer, turned out 170,000 tons. Canada had 17,700 tons to her credit, being eighth in the list of lead producing countries. Iron plates coated with an amalgam of lead are called terne plates.

IV.	ZINC.



Zinc is usually obtained from either the sulphide when it is called blende, or from the carbonate when it is termed calamine. Metallic zinc when made into cakes or ingots is known in commerce as spelter. The ore is first crushed or ground and washed, then calcined in a reverbatory furnace, afterwards going through a series of' retorts for reduction purposes. Zinc having the exceptional property of being readily volatile at the temperature of its reduction, it is necessary therefore that this operation should be carried on in some form of retort and the zinc obtained as a distillate.

Zinc is capable of being rolled at a temperature of 100° to 150° C. into very thin sheets. At a temperature of 200 C. the metal becomes brittle and capable of being pounded in a mortar. At 415°C it fuses, and at 1040 C. it boils. The chief producing countries are Belgium, Silesia, Germany and the United States, the Vielle Montague Company, of Belgium, being the largest single producer, turning out in 8897 over 68,000 tons of crude zinc. Great care should be taken in using zinc to see that it is perfectly pure as in the event of its containing iron it will not resist the action of the atmosphere. The expansion is greater than in other metals, which is the chief drawback to a larger use of this material.

Expansion of Zinc= .0030

Lead = .0028

Tin =.0024

Copper= .0017

Iron=.0011



It is chiefly for this reason that zinc has been used as a coating for iron plates, which have been called erroneously, galvanized iron.

V. —TIN.



This metal, in contradistinction to the other four above mentioned, is very sparsely distributed, the chief countries producing tin being Great Britain (almost entirely in Cornwall) Straits Settlements and Australia. The ore is found in veins or layers within the older crystalline rocks and slates. It often also presents itself in loose crystals in the sandy beds of rivers, having been washed away from its matrix, and is then called stream tin. It is used extensively in the process of tinning iron plates which has of late become quite an extensive branch of the iron trade. There were, in the year 1897, 69 tin plate establishments in the United States alone. No deposits of tin of commercial importance have, however, so far been discovered in either the United States or Canada, and the tin used in the manufacture of these plates is all imported.
