<assoc>THE National Association of Master Builders </assoc>of the United States held an informal meeting in Washington on

March 5th to arrange the preliminaries for a regular convention to be held in the same city next October. Three years have passed since the last general convention of the Association. The value of such gatherings is recognized as affording opportunity for considering all important questions affecting the building industry. An occasional convention of the master builders in the various provinces of the Dominion would no doubt prove beneficial to all concerned. Apart from local Builders' Exchanges in a few cities there exists no organization in Canada among employers in the building trades.

It is hoped that the Council will be as much alive to the future welfare of the city as are the public spirited citizens who are moving in the matter.



A gentleman who recently spent some

time in visiting Canada after having

lived many years in New South Wales has some interesting things to say about that country. He describes it as a country of vast natural wealth. As evidence of its development mentions that, although the population is only 800,000 the export trade amounts to £13,000,000 annually. He states that New South Wales appears to be the Mecca towards which political theorists and economists tend, and in consequence socialistic ideas prevail to a much larger degree than in Canada. For example, all railways, telegraph lines, and public works of every kind are managed directly by the government. Asked regarding the result of these conditions, his reply was that under the prevailing system the cost of public
