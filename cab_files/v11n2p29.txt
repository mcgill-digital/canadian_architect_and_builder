THE LONDON BUILDING DISASTER.

IN the London disaster there was a terrible loss of life, and it is our purpose to determine as nearly as possible the cause or causes resulting in the disaster. We have in this case a large public hail crowded with people who are in a somewhat excited condition, and as a result inclined to crowd together around a central point, which was, in this instance, the platform. The hall was 45'.0 wide by 72.0 long, with the platform placed nearly in the centre of one of the end walls. A portion of the floor of the hall in one of the corners gave way and precipitated those upon it onto the floor below. The size of the floor which gave way was 22. 0" x 28.0, and extended across the hall from one of the side walls. The platform was 16'. 0" wide by 7.0 deep, and 14'. 9 x 7'. o" of it was over the portion which gave way. A beam having a span of 21.0 supported the centre of the space which gave way. The load which was on the beam was that due to the weight of the material in the floor and platform and the weight of the people upon the floor and platform of a space 21.0" x 14'.0", of which the platform occupied, 7'.9' x 6'.6". The total area of floor bearing upon the beam is 294 sq. ft., of which the platform takes up 50 sq. ft. The weight of the floor is close upon 25 lbs. per sq. foot, and of the platform 10 lbs., which would give a dead load, including the weight of beam, of 8,425 lbs. If we allow that the floor should be calculated to carry 100 lbs. per sq. foot, we have a live load of 29,400 lbs., or a total load of 37,825 lbs., upon the 12" X 14" beam.

It is somewhat difficult to arrive with any certainty at the live load. The statement has been made that there were 250 persons upon the portion of the floor which gave way. If we allow the average weight per person to be 135 lbs., we have a total live load of 33,750 lbs. over the entire space which gave way, or a live load of 16,875 lbs. thrown upon the beam. Two hundred and fifty persons on a floor span of 22.0" X 28'. 0" would be equal to one person to every 2.46 sq. ft., which cannot be considered as close crowding it all were standing. From all accounts the crowding was in front of the platform and over the beam which gave way, and it is probable that at least one hundred and fifty of the two hundred and fifty were standing on the portion of the floor supported by the beam. if such should have been the case the load upon the beam would have been 8,425 lbs. dead load and 20,250 lbs. live load, or a total load of 28,675 lbs.

The authorities are not agreed as to the probable load upon a floor of a densely packed mass of people. Hatfield, in his work on the "Theory of Transverse Strains," places the average weight of males between 20 and 50 years of age at 137.9 lbs., and that when closely packed they will occupy 15" X 20' = 300 sq. inches each = to 66 lbs. per sq. foot. An allowance of 300 sq. inches per man does not necessitate men standing very close together, for it has been shown by actual tests that two average men can be packed within the same space, which would make a load of 132 lbs. per sq. foot.

A test was made a short time ago at the School of Practical Science by Mr. Wright as to the number of men who could be crowded into a given space. Thirty-two students were crowded into a space 2'. 11 13-16 X 11'.25/8"=33.46 sq. ft. The total weight of the thirty-two students was 4,656 lbs. 139 lbs. per sq. foot. The average weight of the students was 145.5 lbs., a very high average. Another student could have been packed into this space, which would have made the weight per sq. foot of surface 143 lbs.

Mr. Binder B. Storey (see American Architect, April 15th, 1893) some years ago packed 58 laborers, weighing in all 8,404 lbs., into a deck house of a ship, the floor of which contained 57 sq. ft., which gave an average load on the floor of 147.4 lbs. per sq. foot. On another occasion he packed 73 men, weighing 10,948 lbs., into a hut containing 73 sq. ft., which gave an average weight of 142 lbs. per sq. foot. Prof. Kernot placed sixteen students of his Engineering class in a space of i8 sq. ft., which gave an average of 134.7 lbs. per sq. foot. The students stated that they were not as

closely packed as they could have been, and that there was room for another man. The above tests go to prove that a floor may be loaded to at least 145 lbs. per sq. foot. Some authorities, on the basis of the above tests, claim that a floor should be calculated for a live load of 300 lbs. per sq. foot, to allow for jar through the movement of the crowd ; but 200 lbs. should be ample, as a crowd so densely packed as to weigh 145 lbs. per sq. foot would not be able to move very much.

One of the witnesses at the inquest claimed that the failure must have been due to the jar or impact caused by the movement of the crowd, and seemed to be of the opinion that the result of such impact must be very great. There is not much data at hand to determine what this force amounts to in proportion to the actual load. Hatfield made a number of tests to determine the increase in weight due to movement of people on a floor. Lie used a platform scale 8'.6" x 14'0", which was accurate. Eleven men from a foundry were placed upon the scale, and when standing quietly weighed 1,535 lbs., or an average of 139.55 lbs. per man. The weight when the men were stepping without order was 1,545 lbs., or an increase of 10 lbs.; and when stepping simultaneously or in military order, 1,694 lbs., an increase of 159 lbs., or over 10The men were finally directed to use their utmost exertion in jumping, when the weight produced was 2,330 lbs., or an increase of 795 lbs., or about 52 8668ncrease.

According to the above experiments, the weight of 11 men standing still was 1,535 lbs., moving about indiscriminately, 1,545 lbs., marching in time 1,694 lbs., and jumping about in the most violent manner 2,330 lbs. To obtain the above result the men had to have considerable space to move about in, which would more than counterbalance the increase in weight owing to their jumping. They had a space of 119 sq. ft. in which to jump about in, which made the total load about 20 lbs. per sq. foot. It is not at all likely that when a number of people are packed as close as possible that they will be able to move about in a manner which would increase their weight more than 10We may therefore place the greatest weight which can be exerted upon a floor by a dense mass of people at 160 lbs. per sq. foot, which, with 25 lbs. to the sq. foot for the weight of the floor, would amount to 185 lbs. per sq. foot. As a floor to carry the above load would have to be heavier than an ordinary floor, we may place the weight per sq. foot which should be provided for at 200 lbs. This would be an ample allowance for a crowd of men standing and packed close together as in a dense crowd. Where a hall is fitted with fixed seats 125 lbs. per sq. foot would be an ample allowance, as it would be impossible to get more than halt the number of people into such a hall as could be packed into one without seats.

In the London disaster we have a dense crowd around the platform. This crowd was standing practically over the 12" x 14" beam. The width of the floor which gave way was 22' .0", and of the platform 7 ft.; this would give 15 ft. in front of the platform carried by the beam. The actual load thrown upon the beam would be the number of people carried upon a space 21.0 X 14.0, of which the platform occupied 6.6 x 7.9. We will figure that the total load upon the floor of the hall was at the rate of 150 lbs. per sq. foot, and on the platform at 75 lbs. per sq. foot. This would give a total load of 40,-350 lbs., as against 28,675 lbs. if we take the estimate that there were 250 people on the floor which gave way and that 150 of them were over the beam. This load was carried by a 12 in. x 14 in. beam, built up of four pieces (3 in. x 14 in.) spiked together, but not bolted. This beam, according to Kidder, would carry safely, under a factor of safety of 4, 13,440 lbs., provided that it was composed of average material in a sound condition. The breaking load of the beam would be 53,760 lbs. if the beam was weakened by knots or dry rot 331 as claimed by one witness, the beam would break at 35,840 lbs. Another witness stated that the strength of the beam was not affected by the knots more than 10 7624ch would place the breaking load at 48,-384 lbs. We have figured the possible and likely load upon the beam at 40,350 lbs., which we judge would be
