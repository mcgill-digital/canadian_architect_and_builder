COPYRIGHT OF PLANS.

May 5th, 1893.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



SIR:	Re the complaint of piracy practised by parties claiming to he architects, in the April number of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, permit me to say that in the United States a copyright can be obtained for a design, map, drawing, etc. This, however, must be done before publication of the article. Two complete copies of the work must be sent prepaid, or under the free labels furnished by the librarian, to perfect the copyright. Without the copies above required, the copyright is void, and a penalty is incurred. No copyright is valid unless notice is given by inserting in each copy "Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year — by in the office of the Librarian of Congress at Washington."

The copyright secures the exclusive right of publishing the article copyrighted for the term of 28 years. Is not this the practice in Canada? Then why can't those who feel injured by the piracy of so-called architects, as you call them, get redress?

Respectfully,

Vox POPULL

ART MAXIMS.

THE following verses, kindly sent to us by a correspondent, are from the poems of William Watson, who wrote the best ode on the death of <person>Tennyson</person>, and it was thought might succeed him

Often ornateness

Goes with greatness

Offener felicity

Comes of simplicity.



Talent that's cheapest

Affects singularity;

Thoughts that dive deepest

Rise radiant in clarity.



Life is rough

Sing smoothly, 0 Bard !

Enough, enough.

To have found life hard.



No record Art keeps

Of her travail and throes.

There is toil on the steeps.—

On the summits, repose.

LEGAL DECISIONS.

At the Hamilton assizes a laborer brought an action for $1,500 damages against Mr. <person>Joseph Kent</person>, contractor, of that city, under the Workmen's Compensation Act. It appears that the plaintiff was employed in building a sewer in November last, and while removing some boards the side of the trench caved in and the plaintiff was seriously hurt. It was claimed by him that the trench was improperly shored up. The defendant, however, gained a verdict in his labor.

In Cook v. Belshaw the question is raised whether a mortgage, registered before a lien but riot made until after the attaching of the lien, can be considered a prior mortgage of such a nature that the lien-holder could avail himself of the benefit of the provisions of the Lien gets, giving him priority for the amounts to which the selling value of tile land was increased by the lien-holder's work or materials. The Master-in-Ordinary held it was a prior mortgage in this sense, but his decision has been appealed against.

Caldwell v. Mills was an action tinder the Workmen's Compensation get brought by <person>J. Caldwell </person>against <person>George E. Mills</person>, contractor, of Hamilton, for $2,000 damages for injuries. The plaintiff, it appears, was carrying scaffolding across a plank when the plank broke and he fell into a cellar, breaking three of his ribs. It was alleged the plank was rotten, but mite defense was that the plank broke by another workman throwing a heavy piece of scantling on ii when the plaintiff was crossing. Verdict for the plaintiff, $75; the question of costs being reserved.

<person>Jones</person> v. TORONTO SCHOOL BOAR n—The plaintiff carried out certain works for the defendants under a contract which contained the usual clause to the effect that no extras would be allowed unless the work was executed under the written authority of the architect. Certain extra work was carried out without such authority, but the architect allowed a certain sum for same and when the job was completed the plaintiff accepted in full of all claims a check setting out the amount of con tract, the claim for extras and the amount allowed for such by the architect. After the lapse of two years the plaintiff brought the present suit claiming the balance of the extras as charged by him. The ease was heard by Chief Justice Armor, who dismissed the action without calling upon defendants, because plaintiff could not produce any written authority for the extra work as called for by the terms of his contract.

<person>EVANS</person> v. <person>COWAN</person> (two eases. )—In this ease the plaintiff invited tenders separately for the stone foundation, brickwork and carpentry to a large building to be erected in Montreal for a skating rink. The defendants price for the brickwork was accepted, and a contract was entered into upon the usual terms. When the foundation work was finished the brickwork to the walls was started by Cowan, but after constructing a part serious defects showed themselves in the work which the defendant alleged was due to the had construction of the foundation. Evans ordered the work to be pulled down which Cowan did, but refused to rebuild After protests and counter protests between the parties Cowan took action in the Supreme Court, asking to have his contract declared at an end, that the plaintiff be condemned to pay him $1,000 damages, and allow him to remove all his building materials About the same time Evans entered a suit against Cowan for $3850 damages for non-completion of his contract, The two actions were heard together before Mr. Justice <person>Matthew</person>, who gave judgment in favor of Cowan in both cases, on the grounds that the evidence showed the foundation to be defective, and, as Evans provided that work, Cowan was not obliged to accept and build upon it. Appeals were taken against both judgments and the higher Court decided in favor of Evans in both suits, holding that there was no clear evidence that defects existed in the foundations for which Evans was responsible.
