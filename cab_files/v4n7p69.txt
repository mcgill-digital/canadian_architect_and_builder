"ARCHITECTS and the Law" is a little e publication which should prove of great use to architects of use in pot only showing them what cases it would be safe to press in the way of litigation, but also what to avoid. <person>Mr. Gambier-Bousfield </person>has here compiled a list of cases tried in English, Canadian, French and American Courts, and while not professing to give examples of every kind of dispule which may arise in the course of an architect's practice, the ground covered is quite extensive, as the headings indicate. We commend the work to Canadian architects as a useful one for reference, and do so all the more heartily in that it has been prepared by a member of the Ontario Association.



THE Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc> has had printed and circulated in pamphlet form the by-laws of the Association together with a complete register of the members arranged alphabetically and also according to place of residence, and a transcript of the Ontario Architects Act. Toronto leads off with 73 members, Ottawa following with 19, Hamilton 11, Kingston 7 and London 5, while the members in other towns total 39. making in all a membership of 154. This number includes practically all the architects in the province, a fact which should enable the Association to ask of the Ontario Government at it's next session that the much-maligned word " registered be struck out, and only properly qualified men entering the profession through the Association permitted 10 call themselves "Architect."



THE proceedings of the Council of the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc>, printed in this paper, indicate that active efforts are being made to achieve the fulfilment of the objects which the Association set out to accomplish. The numerous applications for membership on the part of architects and students are extremely gratifying, and may be taken to indicate that the organization is felt to be necessary, and the objects which it is seeking to attain such as are calculated to promote the progress and welfare of the profession. The Association is to be congratulated upon having secured suitable rooms for the exclusive use of its members. The means should be provided to render these rooms a centre of architectural interest, especially to students. The success which has attended the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Sketch Club </assoc>would suggest the desirability of a Montreal institution conducted on somewhat similar lines.



A LEADING lumberman in an interview with a representative of the Canada Lumberman, is reported to have said that the shingle mills throughout the country are working day and night owing to the strong American demand for shingles. American architects and builders are said it have discovered that tin and galvanized roofs such as they have been using of late years, do not possess the necessary weathering qualities, and that in consequence of this discovery they are reverting to the use of wooden shingles. Sixteen inch shingles are said to he in most demand, and prices are rising. We should be pleased to know what has been the experience of Canadian architects and builders with the various kinds of roofing materials. An enquiry reached us a few days ago from an architect in one of the smaller cities for information as to the merits of asbestos roofing. It was learned that in the city of Toronto asbestos is not being employed to any extent, if at all, for roofing purposes, having, it is claimed, been found to be an unsatisfactory material for the purpose.
