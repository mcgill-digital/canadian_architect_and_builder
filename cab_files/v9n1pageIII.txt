O

 U R new Patent Folded Paper Floor Deafener is the most practical and common sense Deafener ever placed between double floors, on account of its peculiar construction forming air chambers, which makes the best deafener known. It IS just coming into use and has already been tested by a number of Architects, from whom a number of testimonials were sent us unsolicited on our part.



If you have an opportunity to use a deafener, we trust you will give this a trial, as we can assure you it will be no experiment if used properly Our regular Carpet Lining will not answer for this purpose, so be sure the Deafener is USED and not the Carpet Lining, in contracts where our Deafener is called for.

It is put up in rolls of 450 square feet, each 36 inches wide, and can be supplied at the factory or bought from our agents at one cent per square foot. Any other information you may wish in regard to the material will be gladly furnished upon application to
