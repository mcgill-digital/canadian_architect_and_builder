<article title=" NOTES.

" author="">NOTES.

We regret to record the death of Mr. John Hillock, a well known figure among the builders of Toronto. Mr. Hillock, when making a Thanksgiving Day visit to his daughter, the wife of Dr. Addison of Penetanguishene, caught a cold from which pneumonia developed. He was born in Toronto in 1834 and had lived there all his life. He is survived by four daughters, three of whom reside in Toronto.

Mr. John Moser, a well-known American architect, died at the age of seventy-two, at Atlanta, In early life he practised in Ohio arid in Canada, but in his later years he settled in Alabama and Georgia, after having filled the place of a designer in the office of the Supervising Architect, under Mr. M. E. Bell, Amongst the buildings designed by Mr. Moser may be named the Cotton Exchange at Galveston, Tex., and St. Philip's Episcopal Cathedral in Atlanta, Ga., the latter being carried out in association with Mr. E. G. Lind.
