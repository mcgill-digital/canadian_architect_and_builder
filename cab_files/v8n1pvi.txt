Architects and Builders say

That Baker's Improved Plaster Board is the best and most common sense system of plastering up to date. It being nailed on dry there is less dampness and dirt. And it can be finished in half the time.

THERE BEING NO FALLING OFF OR CRACKING THE FIRST COST IS THE WHOLE COST. THIS IS RIGHT!
