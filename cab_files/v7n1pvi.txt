IMPROVED PLASTER BOARD

Patented Canada and United States.

European Patents Applied For.





TO ARCHITECT8 AND BUILDER8:

I beg to call your attention to my improvement in

Plaster Boards, which overcomes the one serious objection to its use. I refer to its liability to crack at the joinings. Heretofore, in order to remedy this defect as much as possible, it required great care, extra labour and material, adding considerable to its cost, and then it could not be guaranteed.



Plaster Board is acknowledged by all the leading practical men to have many advantages over all other systems of plastering, in tact, but for this defect referred to, to be superior.



I claim this defect has been overcome by a very simple but equally valuable invention, by which means each board is securely fastened to the adjoining board, all the boards being nailed to the ceiling. They are fastened together by my patent coupling strips ready to receive the finishing coat, making the ceilings and walls practically one piece, all cracking or falling off being entire]y obviated.



Each board contains six superficial feet 3/4 in. thick, representing the lath and two coats of mortar thoroughly dried before being applied, which can be done in about the same time as it takes to apply the laths only, thereby saving about two-thirds of the time required to do ordinary three coat work, which is the on]y way to do good work in old style plastering, either on wood, wire or metallic lath ; then taking the time required for the timber of the building and the air to absorb the enormous amount of water used in the mixing of common plastering, the saving of time and damage to building must be considerable.



ITS ADVANTAGES AND SUPERIORITY:



"It will not fall off"

"It will not crack."

'It will save the time of putting on and drying out two coats."

It is a non-conductor of heat or cold."

"It will not soak the timber."

"It is more fire proof."

"It is cleaner and more vermin proof."

"It will do away with a lot of vexatious and costly delay."

"It is comparatively cheaper."



Try it and save considerable future annoyance and discomfort.
