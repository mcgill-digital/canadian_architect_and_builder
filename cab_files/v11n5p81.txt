The Slate Trade

THE properties of slate and its adaptability to the uses of mankind are said

to have been accidentally discovered in warlike times in Wales when the material, so abundant in that country, was used in the construction of earth-works and fortifications. This, of course, was long antecedent to its discovery and use in the United States. Now, however, slate to the value of nearly one million dollars per year is exported from the United States to Great Britain, This trade began in 1876, and strange to say, at that time, Welsh slates were still being exported to New York, Boston and Philadelphia.



WE. commend to the consideration of Capital and Labor, the leaders of the labor organizations,

the following opinions regarding the rights of capital and labor as expressed by Mr. P. M. Arthur, President of the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers ''1 differ from many labor leaders as to the methods to be pursued in bringing about the best results. I say organized labor is the hope and salvation of the workingmen. The great stumbling block that has injured us in so many ways is the so-called labor organization which attempts to dictate. It cannot see two sides to any question. We should give and take. The interests of capital and labor, I say, are identical, and the only way these matters can be settled is by a fair honest method—Christianity, I might say. We must do unto others as we would have them do unto us.

'We must recognize the fact that we are all entitled to certain considerations. What is capital? You work, accumulate money and get into business. Must you be condemned for that? I say no. That is capital. It is only when it becomes tyrannical that we resist it."

The floor dropped a distance of two feet at the
