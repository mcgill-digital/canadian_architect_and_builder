ing such instruction is for a pupil to enter an architect's office, where. during three years pupilage, he is expected to acquire all the instruction arid training required to qualify him to pass the final examinations required by the Association.

I think you will admit that the office work usually allotted to a student during his pupilage while giving him a good training in practical work which could not be otherwise so well obtained, does not really afford the training in many subjects with which he should familiar the acquisition of knowledge in these subjects depending almost wholly upon his own diligence in the stud' of such works on architectural subjects as may be within his reach. When we consider the cost of architectural works, and the usually very limited means which an architect's student has for purchasing them, it is evident that his means for obtaining information in this way is somewhat limited, and unfortunately, it is to be regretted that the public libraries of Montreal do not contain the class of architectural works most useful to the student who might have the privilege of consulting them.

Until within a comparatively recent period, the same conditions as exist here fur acquiring the training necessary to qualify for the practice of architecture existed elsewhere, but during the last thirty years many members of the profession in Britain, France and the United States, have realized the fact that while the pupilage system has many advantages which cannot he ignored, it does not really afford a training in many subjects with which the student should be familiar if he expects to reach a high position in the profession.

It was probably owing to a realization of the defects of the pupilage system some thirty years ago by eminent members of the R.I.B.A., that an agitation was commenced for tile establishment of a standard of qualification to which a candidate should attain before he was considered fit for practice as an architect, and that his fitness should be proved by passing examinations in prescribed subjects in the same manner as was required by the members of other professional bodies. The result of the agitation was, that the Institute prepared a scheme for voluntary examinations in subjects prescribed by them, the first of which rook place in 1863. As the successful passing of the examinations under this scheme conferred no distinction upon the candidate nor did it give him a position in the profession over those who did not attempt to qualify under the conditions, it is not surprising that the scheme, leading to no practical result, was in a great measure a failure, and the examinations carried out under it gradually languished. After a few years trial of the scheme, some modifications were made in it which had the effect for a time of giving it new life and bringing forward more candidates for voluntary examination. These modifications consisted principally in the dividing of tile examinations into two classes, termed "preliminary," and "proficiency," and the granting of certificates to successful candidates with the title of " Graduates of the Institute," but still leaving them entirely voluntary. After the scheme thus modified had been in operation for some rime, it was felt by many of the leading minds in the profession that though connection with the Institute as Associate had a very considerable value, it did not always give the holders of it the standing in the eyes of the public that they should have it was, therefore, proposed sortie ten years ago, with a view to increase the value of the title <assoc>A.R.I.B.A.</assoc>, to make the examinations compulsory on all future candidates for Association of the Institute. This proposal was, after considerable discussion, adopted, and a scheme of examinations prepared, the successful passing of which entitled the candidate to rank as an Associate ; this scheme has now been in operation for about ten years.

The adoption of compulsory examinations by the Institute soon made it evident that a better system of training than was then in vogue was required to enable candidates to successfully pass them, consequently we find that in University College and Kings College, London, in which the study of architecture formed part of the regular course of instruction modifications were made in their curriculums which better adapted them to furnish, if not the practical, at least the theoretical knowledge necessary to enable their students to pass the examinations fixed by the Institute. Besides these colleges there were a number of institutions of various kinds in London and elsewhere throughout Britain that offered pupils in architects offices an opportunity of obtaining instruction in subjects necessary to qualify for such examinations.

At this distance it would appear as if the opportunities for architectural training in Britain were ample, but judging from the action lately taken by the <assoc>Architectural Association </assoc>composed principally of the younger members of the profession, they do not consider the existing system of education entirely satisfactory, and during the last two years have promulgated a scheme, which is now in actual operation. The promoters of this scheme, while disclaiming any intention of daring antagonistic to existing institutions in which architecture is taught, or of interfering in any way with the present pupilage system, think they can supply the particular education required better than can otherwise be obtained and better calculated to enable their students to pass the examinations prescribed by the R.I.B.A.

On referring to the proposed curriculum of the Architectural Association, I find that it extends over a period of four years divided as follows

First year—The orders of Creek and Roman architecture,

their origin, development and application the several varieties of classic Ornament ; the nature of ordinary building materials and the elementary principles of construction ; plane geometry applied to actual work projection of solids and development (if surfaces; ; elementary physics as applied to building the rudiments of perspective mensuration, chemistry, geology geometrical drawing of ancient examples and free hand drawing.

Second year—English architecture from the Conquest to A. D. 1500 and the successive development of the styles; the characteristic mouldings and ornaments of each period ; the nature of ordinary building materials and tire elementary principles of construction continued from the first year; the calculation of the strength of materials ; land surveying and leveling chemistry of building materials; elementary ornament and color decoration ; drawings of ancient examples ; free hand drawing ; solid geometry.

Third year—History of architecture and features of mouldings and ornament ; materials and their application in building; strength of materials specification writing and taking of quantities ; ornament and color decoration ; sanitary science as applied to drainage elementary natural philosophy, including light, sound, heat, hydrostatics and electricity ; designing and construction of modern buildings ; free hand drawing ; perspective construction masonry.

Fourth year —History of architecture ; materials and their application in building; ; sanitary' science, including water supply, ventilation, lighting and heating ; measurement and valuation of buildings professional practice ; design and construction of modern buildings ; drawings of ancient buildings graphic statics and perspective ; modeling and water color.

From this brief description of what is being- clone in Britain for architectural training, it is evident that it is a subject of vital interest to the profession, and one which at the present time is receiving greater attention than has ever before been given to it.

This interest in the education of architects is not confined to Britain, In France the subject has received time attention of the State, so that some two years ago an ( Official Commission in Paris was appointed to examine the legal conditions tinder which the profession of an architect is exercised, the system of study which gives access to it and the character of the diplomas granted in connection with this study. This Commission after a year s investigation in which they were assisted by provincial societies of architecture, made a report respecting the training to be obtained in Provincial Ecoles des Beaux Arts, and called attention to what they considered defects in the system, the principal defect being that after providing a course of training to qualify as an architect no diploma was granted that would give the holder of it a states as an architect duly qualified to practice his profession. In the report the Commission also calls attention to the peculiar legal responsibility for his work which the law imposes upon an architect in France, and points to the anomaly that while the State exacts certificates of proficiency from contractors doing work of the most common character, it requires no certificate of proficiency- or diploma from the architect who is supposed to be a compendium of knowledge in all that relates to building. The Commission recommend the establishment of district schools in affiliation with faculties of the State for the study of architecture, and that entrance to them should only be obtained after the candidate has shown by' examination that he is sufficiently advanced in his studies to enable him to follow the special course of instruction necessary for his training architect.

The course of instruction recommended for these schools embraces pretty much the same subjects as are provided for- in the curriculum of the Architectural Association to which I have already referred, and consists of the study of architectural forms, analysis of monuments, study of design, decorative art, history, archaeology, perspective stereotomy, hygiene theoretic, technical and practical construction, ventilating, hearing, lighting and professional practice.

The Commission strongly recommend the granting of diplomas to those who pursue tire full course of construction and pass the examinations, and to make the diplomas of value they suggest that only those holding diplomas shall be entrusted with government or municipal work.

The subject of architectural training has of late years received a large share of attention in the United States, where in addition to many art and technical schools of local character that afford assistance to architects' pupils in tire prosecution of their studies, there are several universities, colleges and institutions which have Chairs of Architecture in which a full course of architectural training may he obtained. Among the institutions 1 may mention the Universities of Cornell, Illinois, Philadelphia, Columbia College and the Institute of Technology, Boston. In each the course of instruction extends over four years, and their curriculums embrace all the subjects of a scientific and art character necessary to qualify- their graduates for practice. In the first two years other subjects are taught which do not pertain directly to architecture, but in the last two years of the course the studies are almost wholly confined to architectural subjects. Time art schools of the <building>Metropolitan Museum of Art </building>in New York also conduct courses in architecture, which are so arranged as to prepare pupils who desire it for-admission to tire <building>Ecoles des Beaux Arts</building> in Paris, while for pupils who are engaged in architects' offices and cannot devote tire time necessary for a full course, special classes and lectures are arranged to occupy only
