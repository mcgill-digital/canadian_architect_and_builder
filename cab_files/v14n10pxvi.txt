KELSEY

CORRUGATED WARM

AIR

GENERATORS (Pat'd)

The James Smart Mfg. Co., Brockville, Ont.	Winnipeg Man.. May 16th 1901

Gentlemen,—When erecting our School Board Office Building in the fall of 1900 your agent suggested we should use the 'Kelsey' warm air generator. Tire Chairman of our Building Committee, Mr. John McKechnme, a thoroughly practical man, owner of the Vulcan Iron Works, and myself made a careful examination of the furnace and we agreed it was what we wanted. It was in use all last winter and we are satisfied. It is a good heater, having a large radiating surface, is free from gas or dust, sent heat into most distant part, the attic, and we had to provide a register opening into the basement in order to warm it sufficiently for use.



From a large experience in heating plants 1 have no hesitario in saying the "Kelsey"

	is built ton right lines. Yours		truly,

		J.	B. MITCHELL.

			   Inspector of School Buildings and Supplies.



Over 1,600 KELSEYS in use in its home City, Syracuse N. Y.

KELSEYS are being shown at the Pan-American Exposition.
