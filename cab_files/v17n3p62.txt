NOTES.



The specifications of the new naval barracks at Chatham. Eng. stated that the floors were to be caulked, and the contractor, entered into a sub-contract for the work. The space between the boarding was said in the contract to be 3/8 inch. Owing to the shrinkage of the timber this space was increased, and the subcontractors claimed to have expended 1371. on the additional glue and oakum that was required. The defendants admitted the shrinkage, but maintained that it occurred after the caulking. The jury gave a verdict in favor of plaintiffs, with 1181. damages.
