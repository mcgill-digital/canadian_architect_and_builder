<doctype type="text;ad">December 1889	CANADIAN  ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	143



Horwood, which bespeaks talent worthy of encouragement. The colored perspective of the new <building>upper Canada College</building>

by Mr. <person>George Durand</person>, of London, is a particularly bright and pleasing picture, and shows great facility in the handling of the brush—a distinguishing feature also in the residence of <person>Mr. Labatt</person>. The college is rather residential than scholastic in design, and seems to lack that nobility of effect which we would desire in our Alma Matet.

<person>Mr. Balfour</person>, of Hamilton, has two or three sets of drawings, among which is a court house design drawn with great freedom and spirit by Mr. <person>D. A. Gregg</person>, but lacking in eftective contrasts. The <building>Hamilton Court House</building>, by the same architect, is a well proportioned design, and shows fine drawing.

Mr. <person>J. W. H. Watts</person>, of Ottawa, sends a number of lithographs of decorated interiors and designs for art furniture. The drawings are elaborate, but lack freedom and vigour. The only set of measured drawings are sent by Mr. <person>A. M. Calderon</person>, of Ottawa, the subject being "Stone Church, Kent."

We noticed some artistic sketches by Messrs. <firm>Edwards & Webster</firm>. The massing of shadows more in accordance with the principles of nature would, however, materially improve these sketches.

A sepia sketch of the City Hall and Law Courts, San Francisco, Cal., by Mr. Fuller, is a wonderfully clever bird's-eye view of a clever design, cleverly adapted to a peculiar site.

An excellent example of the old time Manor House is <person>Mr. McLaren </person>house at Perth, by Messrs. <firm>Darling & Curry</firm>.

The competitive designs of the <building>Confederation Life Assurance building </building>and of the <building>Board of Trade </building>occupy considerable space. But criticisms on these would be somewhat superfluous here as they have already been subjected to professional criticism.

We were amused to see <person>Mr. Paull </person>Salvation Army Barracks hung cheek-by-jowl with photographs of the glorious old St. Mark's in Venice, but we suppose this to be a little joke on the part of the hanging committee.

Space prevents our giving allusions to the many excellent drawings which line the walls.

THIS

 building will be seven stories high. The interior will be constructed of iron frame work and fire proof brick, in a new and novel manner. The construction will be so arranged that one or more, or even the entire partitions through out any flat, can be removed without affecting the construction

of the other floors. Every accommodation is provided for the occupants—vaults for all offices, private lavatories on all floors, and public lavatories for male and female on top flat. There will be two iron passenger elevators. All staircases will be wrought iron with marble steps. The main entrance will be about 20 feet wide, forming a handsome archway, and will have marble staircases, and marble floors and walls. The exterior will be constructed of Connecticut and New Brunswick brown stone, and a selected quality of new colored brick. <person>E. J. Lennox, </person>architect, Toronto.

<article title="Proposed Architectural Club" author="">PROPOSED ARCHITECTURAL CLUB.

There has been a growing feeling among the younger members of the profession in Toronto, favoring the formation of a new Architectural Club. A representative meeting of those interested was held in the Canadian Institute on December 5th, to discuss and formulate ideas on the subject. Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, on request took the chair and opened the meeting by some thoughtful and pointed suggestions. A lively exchange of opinions followed, in which a large number of those present took part. The prevailing sentiment seemed in favor of an organization which would embrace in its membership all those engaged in the practice and study of architecture, as well as members of that large class who are indirectly connected with the mother art. By including the latter, it was thought that the engineering and artistic elements of the club might be individually strengthened. The architect, the sculptor, the decorator and the mechanic could meet on a common ground, and aid each other towards a higher standard of thought and design. Regarding the objects and methods of the club there were many suggestions and a good deal of debate. Competitions to be held at least once a month, were generally conceded desirable, as also regular debates or lectures on technical subjects. It was suggested that the club be made attractive by the establishment of classes in pen and ink, water colour and modelling in clay, and also by keeping professional papers on file, and by the development of the social and friendly relations of its members. To do all this successfully, permanent club rooms were deemed necessary, and it was thought if located up town they would be more convenient to the mass of the members. It was not expected that the proposed club would be in any sense a rival of the Architectural Guild of Toronto. Working with different ends in view, and with a less restricted membership, it was hoped not only to receive its support and favour, but also to include on its roll many members of the older association.

A committee composed of Messrs. Jarvis, Lennox, Gibson, Dawson, Goldstone, Gregg, Brown and Cowtor was appointed to make the necessary arrangements for organization, and everything points to a successful out come of the new venture.



A meeting to be held in the Canadian Institute, is called for Friday evening, December 20th and all interested are cordially invited to be present.
