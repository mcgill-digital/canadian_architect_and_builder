<article title=" The Specialization of Architects " author="">The Specialization of Architects.

A recent writer complains that amid all the specialization of present conditions of work the



architect alone declines, as a rule, to specialize; and he argues that. it is for this reason that the architect is ceasing to be an artist and has become a man of business. There is something- to be said on this side. That is to say, it is the opportunity to make his work perfect that develops the artist, and it is only by exclusive devotion to one problem or one class of problems that an architect can give his mind to his problem enough to produce real design. Otherwise the stock materials of design, that have served so many purposes, must he tossed up again to put a decent face upon new problems which there is no time to think out.. The flew problems must, however, be taken up. There are no quiet eddies now in the stream of business. Could something he done by specialization in firms? It will mean larger firms and less profits, but more of a life— and we have only one life.



We are going to he put to shame soon in this matter by cities in the United States. The

journals have long been crying out about the non-exaction of the laws against over production of smoke and reforms are now following. '[hat the reforms not only can he brought about but brought about suddenly, is shown by the action of the Mayor of Rochester who decreed that black smoke must cease on the first of June. It ceased on that day and Rochester since

An hour or so of black smoke is allowed early in the morning to get things started ; but after that, if the watchers stationed on various high towers see any black smoke, there is trouble for the man who made it. That is he way it is done. There is nothing new Or remarkable about it except that it is really done. Other towns have about the same laws and the same facilities for carrying them out. One demonstration of the feasibility of carrying out the law will no doubt produce a sequence of similar results.





The <assoc>Manitoba Association of

Architects </assoc>was organized on

May 25th, about forty architects being present at <building>Manitoba Hall</building>, where the session was held. Only three or four outside architects were present, but the association will supply a long—felt want to correct the abuses and competition craze which has infested Winnipeg.

The following officers were elected: President, <person>S. F. Peters </person>; Vice-president, <person>J. H. G. Russell</person> ; 2nd vice-president, <person>C. H. Wheeler </person>; Treasurer, <person>L. 0. Bristow</person>; Secretary, <person>Pery Over</person>. Directors : Messrs. <person>S. Hooper</person>,

<person>J.	Greenfield</person>, <person>J. Chisholm</person>, <person>Atchison</person> and <person>Elliott</person>.

The constitution adopted was similar to that of the Eastern Associations as was also the schedule of fees. A set of rules governing competitions—to govern which is one of the first reasons for associating was also adopted. The first rule, that $25,000 should he
