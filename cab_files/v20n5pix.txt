WATERPROOF GLUE.

Waterproof glue is manufactured of gum shellac three parts and India rubber one part by weight, these constituents being dissolved in separate vessels in ether, free from alcohol, subject to a gentle heat. When thoroughly dissolved the two solutions are mixed and kept for some time in a vessel tightly sealed. It is further claimed that this glue resists the action of water, both hot and cold, as well as most

acids and alkalies. If the glue is thinned by the admixture of ether and applied as a varnish to leather along the seams where this has been sewn together, it renders the joint or seam water-tight and almost impossible to separate.



The railroad tunnel through the Cinch Mountains, near Richmond, has been stopped because a bed of rock has been encountered that the steel drills cannot pierce. Dynamite that was exploded in the rock did not affect it.
