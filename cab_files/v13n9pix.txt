The Toronto Master Plumbers' Association have been at work for some time on the preparation of a new plumbing by-law, which will shortly be handed over to the city council for consideration and adoption.

The committee appointed at the recent convention of the National Master Plumbers' Association of Canada, to confer with

the manufactures with a view to the adjustment of certain matters in dispute, are said to be endeavoring to induce the manufacturers to form an Association with which the Plumbers' Association could deal. The desire is that the manufacturers should sell only to members of the Plumbers' Association, and that the latter should buy only from the members of the Manufacturers Association. A code of price is also desired.
