RELATING TO PRESSURE OF AIR AND WATER 

It appears that the relations of pressure to distance in the forcing of water do not apply in the ease of air, especially for long distances, although for short distances they may he taken as similar. Thus, if a certain head



pressure be required to maintain an air current of a given volume and force through 1,000 feet, twice the head would not be sufficient for 2,000 feet This is because of the increase in volume due to reduction in pressure, or loss of head, by the time the cud of the first 1,000 feet has lit-en reached. Consequently a greater pressure must be used to counteract this increased volume, in addition to tile extra head required to maintain the force of the current beyond. The bulk of the pressure, however, is lost by leakage and by the bands and elbows of the tube, especially when the latter have too small a radius, the resistance or retarding effect increasing in some at present unknown proportion as the radius of the curve diminishes. In one cast- the loss of pressure, including leakage, was only two pounds of the initial 60 pounds required to transmit 875 cubic feet of air per minute through an eight inch pipe, 150 feet. long. In another case, the driving of the Jeddo tunnel, at Ebervale, Pa., the loss was only 0.002 pound in transmitting air through a six inch tube a maximum distance of 10,800 feet to drive two 3 1-4 inch drills. The volume of air required, however, for this purpose, 230 cubic feet per minute, was in small proportion to the size of the tube used. By careful consideration the transmission losses may be reduced to a minimum.— (R. Peel, Mine and Minerals, Pennsylvania, Vol. XX.)
