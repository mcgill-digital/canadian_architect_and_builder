THE Australasian Builder suggests that New South Wales copy the example of British Columbia by sending to the World's Fair specimens of its native timbers Our Pacific province will build a structure which will contain all the varieties of native woods. It will be built in sections of contrasting woods, neatly mortised together ; the roof will consist of native slate and a variety of cedar shingles. The building will be shipped to Chicago in sections, and will he put together on the fair grounds.



ADDITIONAL interest would he given to the annual meetings of the O. A. A. if to the usual exhibition of drawings there was added an exhibit of building materials and appliances. We understand that an upper flat in the School of Science might be utilized for this purpose. Such an exhibit would be especially interesting to members of the Association practising in the towns and smaller cities of the Province, who are without the opportunities open to architects in large cities of becoming familiar with the latest improvements in materials. An exhibit of this character might assist in bringing to the annual meetings a larger number of the members resident outside of Toronto. There is little reason to doubt that manufacturers and dealers would be pleased to exhibit if the necessary accommodation for the purpose was provided.

IT was announced early this month by Sir <person>John Thomson </person>that the Dominion Government intends to erect a statue to Sir John Macdonald on Parliament Square, Ottawa, and the announcement was received by all members of the House with great satisfaction. What the intention of the Government may be as to the employment of an artist for this work we have not heard ; the money has yet to be voted for the purpose, and until that is done no decision will be made. It is, however, earnestly to be hoped that the best talent in the Dominion may be secured for the work—-and that there is talent capable of executing the work to be found within our boundries there can be no reason to doubt. No one but a Canadian should have the com mission for such a thoroughly national monument, and every facility should be given to Canadian artists to enable them by competition or otherwise to show that they possess the necessary talent.



THE appointment of <person>Prof. Saunders </person>as Canadian Commissioner to the Columbian Exposition or "World's Fair" will be a satisfaction to every one interested. Prof. Saunders has had great experience in these matters, having acted as our Commissioner in nearly all the exhibitions Canada has taken part in, and we feel sure that so far as the Commissioner is concerned, the exhibition of Canadian products and manufactures will be a success. As to exactly what the arrangements are for our exhibits, we have not yet been able to find out; very little seems to have been done as yet. The Montreal Board of Trade are taking the matter up on behalf of or in the interests of the city, and it is to be hoped that, other cities will now begin to interest themselves in the matter. All loyal Canadians should do their best to make this exhibition a success, sinking petty jealousies with regard to our neighbor and remembering only the great interests of Canada.
