T

HE following report prepared by a Committee of the <assoc>Quebec Association of Architects </assoc>on the nature of the building stones in what is known as the Lake St. John District, will no doubt prove of interest and value to Canadian architects and builders:

To the "Province of Quebec Association of Architects, and all whom it

may concern.

The undersigned, at the instance of the Quebec Local Association of Architects, have the honor to make the following report on the quarries now open on the Quebec and Lake St. John Railway line; the said quarries having been visited at the invitation of the Railway Company, on the 13th and 14th inst. in company with other architects, stone cutters and others.

1.	The first quarry visited and called Bourg-Louis" quarry, is situated at a half mile distance on this side of the station of that name, and thirty miles and a half

from Quebec. It was opened last summer by M. <person>Ignace Bilodeau</person>, who is also the proprietor. A number of bridge piers and culverts have been constructed in its neighborhood with stone extracted from it. All the stone paving of Dambourges hill in this city has been drawn from there since. Although opened for a comparatively short time, the appearances at present are that this quarry will furnish a very fine building stone. The predominating colors in it are the red, blue and light grey, which blending together, produce sometimes a good effect.

2.	The second quarry is situated at a distance of one mile from the Riviere a Pierre station, which is itself at 58 miles distance from Quebec. It is on the slope of a mountain and a few arpents only from the main road. It was opened by M. <person>Frs. Parent </person>during the course of last summer, but it is owned by <person>M. Voyer</person>. We find there some layers of stone of above three feet in thickness and very regular, which could furnish material for monolith columns and other stones of large dimensions. The stone is coarse grained, of a grayish color admixed with red, and presents a brilliant surface owing to the feldspath which it contains: the effect is very fine.

3.	About one third of a mile further from this quarry, and on the same mountain slope, we find the

quarry owned by M. Frs. Parent, which was opened by him only a few weeks ago. The stone from this quarry has all the qualities which characterize its neighbor. It is being employed at present in the construction of a house for the Hon. <person>Chas. Langelier </person>at the corner of Grande-Alley and Conrey streets, in this city. The string courses dividing the stories will probably be polished, as the stone gives every indication of lending itself well to the process. Stone from this quarry and the previous one has been used in the facings of <person>Chevalier Baillarge'</person>s house on St. Louis street (on the site of the old Montgomery house) and the adjoining one owned by <person>M. Hogan</person>. nevertheless the eye cannot detect any difference in the appearance of the two stones, a fact which proves their identity. As the quarry is situated at a certain distance from the railway line, the company will construct a siding to facilitate transport.



4.	At half a mile distance from Miquick river station, and at 74 1/2 miles from Quebec. we <person>find M. Bolanger'</person>s quarry, which is being worked for a couple of years past. We can obtain here stones of very large dimensions, which the proprietor uses in the construction of monuments and constructions of all kinds it can be easily polished and cut in any form. <building>The Cartier

Brehoeuf monument </building>erected on the shore of Lairet river in 1889 is from that quarry, also the heavy copings and pillars around the Court House in this city. This stone is spotted with black and bluish-gray, and has a very fine appearance.

5.	Further on, and at a distance of 178 1/2 miles from Quebec and 1 1/2 miles from <building>Chambord station</building>, on the littoral of Lake St. John on the Chicoutimi and St. Alphonse embranchment we arrive at the quarry owned by <person>M. H.

J.	Beemer</person>, the constructor of the Quebec and Lake St. John railway line. As in the case of the Bourg-Louis and Miquick quarries, this one is close to the railway line, and can consequently be easily and cheaply worked. The stone is calcareous and is stratified, as are all sedimentary stones the thickness of the beds varies from one to two feet. As this stone can be extracted in large blocks, it is found very advantageous for the construction of bridge piers and other similar works, when stones of large dimensions are required. Its color is of a bluish gray, with a very fine grain and a texture better suited to rock work than to finely cut faces. The masonry work of the bridges on the St. Charles river at Lorette and that of Riviere des Merces is from this quarry; a fact which proves the superiority of the

stone in construction of that kind, since the contractors have gone to such a great distance to

obtain it.

6.	At Roberval, a distance of 190

miles from Quebec, and also near the shore of Lake St. John, we find there other quarries of a calcareous nature, similar to the Chambord quarry, but of a finer and more homogeneous grain, which renders this stone more fitted to finely cut work than the others. One of these quarries is at a distance of about 4

miles on this side

of Roberval station and is owned

by a <person>M. Ouellet</person>.

The stone cornices and window and door trimmings of <building>Hebertville Church </building>are from this quarry. The other two quarries are at a few arpents distance only from <building>Roberval church </building>and near the railway station: one of these belongs to M. <person>Ephrem Brassard </person>and the other to <person>M. Menard</person>. All the stone which was employed in the construction of the <building>Ursulines Convent at Roberval </building>comes from these two quarries.

7.	A fine quarry of granite (gneiss)

of a reddish color

is seen at about 4 miles distance of Roberval, in a cut made for the passage of the rail. way; this quarry is not worked, but by the appearance of the stone we cannot but think that it

would furnish a

fine building stone. At many other points on the railway line, where cuts have been made for the passage, can be seen further indications of a good stone for constructing purposes and street paving. With the exception of M. Beemer's quarry at Chamford, and those of Roberval, which are all of a calcareous nature, the other quarries mentioned are of granite (gneissie) formed by the agglomeration of three minerals: feldspath, mica and quartz.

As already referred to, the granite show varied tints, but the proportion of the three minerals not being the same in each, it follows that the stone in some quarries is much harder than that of the others, according to the greater or less proportion of quartz contained in each kind. Notwithstanding this fact, all these granites can be cut with ease and give a fine polish, Their great durability renders their adoption most advantageous, in spite of their being a little more expensive to cut than lime stones, and as the means of extracting and transporting them are not costly it is clear that we should prefer them to lime stone: they also possess a greater variety and richness of colors.

The calcareous quarries of Chambord aud Roberval furnish a stone of an earthly texture, coarse grained and of a rough surface when broken. The
