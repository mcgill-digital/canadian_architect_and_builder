Some Hints for Mill men.

MILL men are often called upon to get Out stuff of various kinds for which no provision has been made for working

Out with the machines at their command. With a

work that can be produced, and in case an ornament or a different number of sides from 4 to 8 is desirable, the gain shown and the block maybe made to suit. The manner of operating is shown at Fig. 2, when the saw is forming the cross ornament. It is necessary the block should have as many sides as the desired ornament, and that the gain be made to fit the block. It is

The size of the device is not material. It should, however, be proportioned to the size of the work to be done.

For example, for a s-inch rosette it would be well to make Fig. I about one foot long arid four inches high. The gain in the inclined piece should be about 2'4 inches square and the block should fit neatly in the gain of the inclined piece. The gain and the block may he square or semi-circular. The following direction will indicate how the attachment is to be used: Cut the face figure of the ornament first, then fasten it to the block by means of wood screws as shown. Drop the
