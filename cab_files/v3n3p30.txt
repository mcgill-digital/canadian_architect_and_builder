TORONTO, March 4, 1890.

	Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER.



SIR,—One of the chief objections raised to technical instruction by means of trades classes has been, that it would increase so largely the competition in the different trades taught, as to prove an injury rather than a benefit to those engaged in them. I do not see it in that light, for as soon as bricklayers, plasterers, carpenters, etc., had got to work, there would be established classes for plumbers, printers, etc. The boy who would seek to learn the trade of printing would not attend the class for plasterers and bother his mind with trying to learn how to run segmental, elliptical and gothic arches.

I would like to ask the opponents of trades classes, how an apprentice is to lay out works such as his employers never contract for? For instance, there are men in Toronto who have served their apprenticeship, but have not the least idea of how to lay out or run an arch of any kind. I am now speaking of the plastering trade.

This matter of technical instruction should be taken up by somebody, but there is small encouragement for anybody to take it up, when we find as its opponents the very people it would most benefit, viz., the tradesmen. We can hardly expect doctors, lawyers, or professional men of any kind to interest themselves so long as this condition of things exists. Professional men have their "trade classes" (under another name). Fancy an architect opposing the teaching of architectural drawings, and giving as a practical reason that it would make too many architects !

Yours truly,

ONE INTERESTED IN THE APPRENTICES.





<article title="Employment of a Quantity supervisor" author="Baillairgé, Charles">EMPLOYMENT OF A QUANTITY SURVEYOR.

QUEBEC, Feb. 26, 1890.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—Your remarks re the advisability of architects employing "quantity surveyors" in the preparation of bills of quantities for contractors to tender by, are altogether to the point, as my 40 years experience enables me to testify; and there is among others one very potent reason why this practice should be adhered to, to wit when quantities are supplied direct from the architect whose design is to be carried out, he is, in case of any omission, error or deficiency in the quantities looked to by the contractor to recommend extra pay on account of the additional work thus entailed, and which he has made no allowance for, though binding on him to execute under the requirements of the specification and contract.

This puts the architect in a false position towards his employers, by saddling him with a responsibility of which he should be clear, and is, when the quantities are had from a third party, whom the contractor can hold liable for errors or satisfy himself of the correctness thereof, thus in either case disengaging the architect's responsibility and securing his absolute impartiality of action in the premises.

DEAR SIR,—Could you inform us of the address of a manufacturer of Canadian portable houses. We believe these were made in Upper Canada the time of the opening up of the North West. We have an inquiry from a friend in London, who would probably take about a dozen.

TRENTON, Feb. 19th, 1890.



Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—Under the head of "Queries and Answers" "Enquirer,, is advised to line his chimney with glazed drain pipes, as it would be an absolute remedy against dampness, complained of. I believe it would; but it is possible that he might get into another difficulty that would be no less annoying.

I was once employed on a chimney where the contractor supplied glazed pipes 15 inches diameter, and thought he was using the best material, but on inspection the glazed pipes were ordered to be removed and their places supplied with unglazed pipes, as the soot was said to collect and adhere to the glazed pipes so that it could not be swept off, and the flue would eventually be stopped up.

I would like to hear from some one who has had practical experience on this point.

Yours respectfully.

VAULT CONSTRUCTION.



Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



SIR,—In your January number a correspondent asks for opinions as to the relative value of " two 8 inch walls with 2 inch air space between, or 12 inch wall outside. and 2 inch air space with 4 inch wall inside, bonded say every 5 feet super. to outside wall."

While I am of opinion that no vault, intended to be fireproof, should have its outer wall less than 12" in thickness nor its inner wall less than 8", I agree with you that two walls 8" thick, entirely disconnected to springing line, with 2" air space between, affords greater protection against fire than the other plan suggested by your correspondent ; for I consider that a 12" outer wall would, in case of a severe fire, absorb more heat than the 4" lining could safely resist.

Again, the method of bonding the walls together with a header brick every 5 feet super. is objectionable; for each header would become a conductor of heat, and thus the benefit of an air space would be lost, and the fundamental principle of vault construction would be completely ignored.

Yours truly,

FIVE PER CENT.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



A

 MEETING of architects practising in this city was recently held in the office of <person>Mr. Berlinguet</person>, when a committee was named to take the necessary preliminary steps to organize an Association of Architects for the city of Quebec, with the view, later on, of extending its operation over the Province of Quebec, by requesting Montreal architects to join In the movement. At a late meeting of the committee It was decided to defer any further action until it was seen how the Bill to incorporate the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc> fared, particularly as it was impossible to get a Bill through the Quebec Legislature this session owing to the proposed early adjournment of the House.

Referring to the City Hall competition, one architect speaks of the 'Instructions to Architects" as reading more like a description of a design already prepared, than as a basis of designs yet to be elaborated, while another considers it unfair that the document referred to should have been printed in English only, a reasonable objection, when it is remembered that with one exception all the local architects are French, as well as a
