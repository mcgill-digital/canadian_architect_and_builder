EARTHEN PIPES AT FOUNDATION WALLS.

THERE is frequently asked a question in regard to stopping earthen pipes outside the foundation walls which is now always answered in a satisfactory manner. A man laying earthen pipe, unless he has strict orders to the contrary, is inclined to carry it to the inside face of the foundation. When left in this condition, the plumber carries his house drain into the earthen sewer, covers the joint with a good supply of cement (which in a great many cases only covers the upper half of the pipe), and the work is considered complete. Then follows the mason who points up the opening made in the stone work, very much as we have shown in Fig 1. There is no fault to be found with this at the













































time of construction, provided the plumber has succeeded in making a tight joint between the earthen and iron pipe.

If the house has an area, as shown in Fig. 2, the earthen pipe or house sewer is usually brought inside the area small and left nearly flush with the outside wall of the foundation. The concrete of the area is laid down over the earthen pipe, and the area wall is pointed up. This is, like the former, a good job while it is new, but it is very objectionable when carried out in the way shown for this reason The excavation is always made somewhat larger than the wall, and the wall itself, sitting on fresh soil, is liable to settle. Even the light area walls have considerable movement. In addition to this, the dirt behind them (as shown in the figures) is loose, and after rains usually goes down sometimes to the extent of several inches. The walls being cemented close around the earthen pipe, go down with the dirt, and the result is either the cement around one of the joints of the house sewer is split or broken or the pipe itself breaks. This break being on top is not readily discovered, but at the most dangerous place in the whole house it permits the entrance of foul gases into the basement of the building from which they will be carried by the natural currents into all parts of the house. In case there is an area the danger is usually quite as great, because the area wall is built with less care, and























































settlements under the action of frost and rain are much more common than in foundations. These settlements are also greater in extent. It was probably for this reason that the New York city plumbing rule calls for the iron pipe to extend two feet outside of the outside face of foundation or area walls through which the pipe passes.

In cities where earthen house drains, as well as earthen sewers

are allowed, the trouble from settlement is just as great as in the two cases mentioned. But it is possible to overcome this difficulty if proper precautions are taken. These precautions are simple and not at all costly. If the pipe passes through an opening so arranged that the settlement of the wall cannot affect the pipe, the object is accomplished. If, as in Fig 3, at the foot of the foundation wall a flag stone, or other foot stone is at ranged, so as to support the wall, at the same time leaving an opening for the pipe to pass through, the settlement will be provided for without throwing any pressure upon the pipe at one















































point, and the pipe, not being disturbed, will be safe. This precaution can he taken at area walls equally well, and the result is the safety of the pipe at a critical point. When pointing it must be kept in mind when carrying the pipe through a wall in this way, that is, if the hole where the pipe comes through is cemented up solidly, as is sometimes done, the advantage of having an opening or arch which might be used instead of the flat stone, all the advantages will be destroyed. Hence this opening should be filled tip loosely and only the very face of the wall closed with cement in sufficient quantity merely to keep out vermin.â€”Metal.

INSANITARY CONDITIONS IN MONTREAL.

MR. <person>R. P. Fleming</person>, speaking as to the sanitary conditions in Montreal, says that the serious defects found in houses examined for the first time reaches 83 per cent. The inspection referred to was among large houses in the best part of the city, so that this gives no idea of what may exist among smaller properties where the inhabitants have to depend upon the owners and authorities for a proper condition of things. In his report to the Montreal Sanitary Association on this subject, Mr. Fleming particularizes cases of defects of various characters, such as bad plumbing and pipe laying, but in almost all the cases sewer gas has direct access to the interior of the houses. It is surprising that such a state of things could possibly exist in a city like Montreal. In a large house in the best part of the city the soil pipes were found simply laid in without any jointing of any kind, and one two-inch pipe, perfectly open at the end, was discharging volumes of sewer gas into the house. Besides this the cess-pool was situated directly tinder the kitchen where the servants lived, worked and cooked. The report closes by calling upon the association to take further steps to urge the City Council to provide proper inspection and supervision of all sanitary arrangements. It is hoped the petition which the Sanitary Association have prepared, when presented to the Council, will be acted upon ___________________

The leaves of the book are intersected with over 50 illustrations dealing not only with matters relating to the Exchange, but also by a series of good cuts taken from photos of models exhibited at the Paris Exhibition in 1889, showing the different class of habitations in the principal countries of the world. The book should be in the reading room of every Builders' Exchange.
