NOTES.

	A St. Paul architect has won a case in court to	recover his

fees	for	making	and furnishing	plans, is.	the	jury deciding a



question specifically	put to them that the architect did not agree to cut his is fee. The decision is a welcome one in more ways than one. There seems to be a somewhat general impression that it is perfectly proper for a possible builder to go shopping around for plans, and to secure sketches on the same terms that samples of dress goods are secured from departmental stores. The architect s work is not appreciated by the general public and it seems to be taken as a matter of course that if the proposed building is not erected, there is little obligation to the architect. A few more wholesome court decisions, as a means of enforcing the fact that the architect's work should be paid for, whether the client builds or not, would be quite educational as well as very satisfactory.
