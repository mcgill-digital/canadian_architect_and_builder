<article title=" THE TORONTO BUILDERS' EXCHANGE " author="">THE TORONTO BUILDERS' EXCHANGE. <assoc>THE TORONTO BUILDERS' EXCHANGE</assoc>

The Toronto Builders' Exchange may be said to have originated from the old <assoc>General Builders' Society</assoc>, which was established in 1867; at a later date was formed the Federated Builders' Association. The Federated Association was merged into the Builders' Exchange in 1892, when the Exchange became incorporated.

The first President was Mr. <person>W. J. Hill</person>, who subsequently represented the Liberal interest in West York in the Ontario Legislature.

The Exchange at first occupied offices at Victoria street near Adelaide street; later, more suitable premises were taken on Victoria street near King street. The present premises are entirely inadequate for the largely increased membership, and the Hoard of Directors are negotiating for premises which will give ample accommodation for all branches of the building trade. The new premises will comprise offices for the various sections, together with Board room, Estimating rooms, Committee room and a large general Assembly room.

The management of the Exchange is vested in a Board of Directors which meets monthly. The following committees deal with such matters as come within their province Finance Committee, Legislation Committee, Labor Committee.

Should any differences arise between members, the same may be referred to an Arbitration Committee for settlement.

The usefulness of the Exchange has been manifested in many instances. The advisability of adopting a uniform contract form has been for some time very apparent, some of the contracts which builders have been called upon to sign having been notoriously unfair.

By mutual agreement between the Architects' Association and the Exchange, the "Revised Contract" was amended in 1904 and this form will be used in all future contracts.

The adjustment of labor difficulties in connection with the building trade has also been a feature of the Exchange work. It has always been recognized that a policy of fairness and conciliation in treating with their employees is the best, and the Exchange has endeavored to carry out this principle, although when the demands of organized labor were unreasonable, the Exchange has always declined to accede to such demands.

The usefulness of the Exchange in every-day affairs becomes daily more apparent.

Apart from other considerations, the daily association of men engaged in similar lines of industry must, naturally, result in better feeling, and broader and more liberal views in business matters. In proportion to the interest taken in Exchange work by the members will its usefulness be extended.

The large amounts of money expended every year in building operations, and so large a percentage of the population being employed thereon, the Builders' Exchange must necessarily be an important factor in the future of Toronto.

The Act of Incorporation states that the purpose of the Exchange shall be to "inculcate just and equitable principles, and to promote good feeling and harmony among those engaged in the building trade, to the end that membership in this Society shall be an assurance to the public of skill, honorable reputation and probity."

These principles, if carried out in practice, must

prove beneficial to all the trade, and fully justify the existence of the Exchange.
