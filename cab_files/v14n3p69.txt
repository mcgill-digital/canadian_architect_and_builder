A CORRECTION.

<article title=" A CORRECTION " author="Bryce, P. H.">

Toronto, Feb. 28th, 1901.



Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



SIR,- -Mr. Bishop, Architect of the Public Schools, Toronto, has brought to my attention the report of my remarks at the recent Convention of the Ontario Association of Architects.



The rough report of my remarks was looked over very hurriedly, and I am sorry I am quoted as having said, The ventilation of our schools was criminally neglected."



I have no recollection of using the words " criminally neglected, and certainly would not use them, but I think I was referring in my remarks to some 28 class-rooms which I inspected two years ago, used as a temporary accommodation.



Many of the schools arc as regards fresh air well supplied if not overcrowded, and I am glad to learn from Mr. Bishop that arrangements are being made for supplying adequate moisture, and in new schools for mechanical means of ventilation.



I shall be obliged if you will give this note space in your next issue.

Yours truly,

P.	H. Bryce
