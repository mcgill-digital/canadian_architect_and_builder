pipe is called Scotch it will pass, no matter bow inferior in quality in fact the magic name of "Scotch" renders it

unnecessary to inspect the —pipe. Scotch pipes are being largely used in

Toronto this year and are to be seen at most street corners. I would ask you or any of your readers to examine the first batch of these pipes that you see. The outside of the pipe is salt glazed undoubtedly but how about the inside? In the case of perhaps 50 per cent, the glaze inside the pipe is put on with a sponge or a brush, and great care is not taken to cover the whole surface and the glaze is streaked on. I don't say what that glaze is, whether varnish paint, or a slip, but I do say it is not salt glaze, because salt glaze is not put on with a brush or a sponge, but is the chemical action of chloride of sodium in a volatilized condition) on the silicate and alumina contained in the clay, and the pipes are subjected to this process when at a temperature of about 2,700' Fahr.



The inference is that these pipes are not first quality, but that the exigencies of competition against

the growing industry in this country, has made I it necessary for dealers to buy a cheap pipe ; and this idea is borne out by the fact that importers of Scotch pipes are entering them at customs at the following prices :—.4 inch pipes per yard. 40.; 8 inch, 6'!.; 9 inch, 9d. ; 12 inch, is. Is it reasonable to suppose that a Rood article could be delivered from 10 to 15 miles from the works, alongside ship in Glasgow at these figures?

The facilities for manufacturing on the Ohio River are equal superior to Scotland, but in face of the severe competition in the United States. the prices are at So per cent, off the list :—4 inch, 12c. 6d. ; 6 inch, 18c 9d. ; 9 inch, 33c.=1s 41/2d 12 inch, = 25. 11/2d. =

-	from 50. to zoo per cent. higher than Scotch. I consider the Ohio pipe far superior to the

Scotch6 being well glazed and of a denser body and better calculated to resist absorption and the action of acids, but they are not up to the standard of thickness—in fact, they are in some sizes 25 per cent. below it, This is probably occasioned by the necessity of saving freight in shipment, hut the standard—1 inch in thickness to 12 inches in diameter, is quite thin enough to bear the superincumbent weight of earth, and should be insisted upon by engineers.'

Scotch pipes of some brands do not come up to the standard of thickness, and the change to a lighter pipe has been noticeable during the last three years, the same object being in view, viz., to lessen the freight at the expense of utility.

In reference to the pipe made at St. Johns, we would say, that it is the strongest pipe in the

market, well glazed, of dense body. and thoroughly



	vitrified and	think we cannot offer a

fairer way of settling the question of their being equal or superior to any pipe imported into Canada, than by offering to meet in open and public

competition, any other brand—the pipes to be tested by any means suggested by an engineer named by us, and one named-by the represents two engineers

nominating a third. All the writing in the world would not remove the inborn prejudice in some men's minds but an ocular demonstration might, and we invite all importers to take up this challenge, which we will attend to very promptly.

Yours very truly,
