rested while the lower portions were cut away. A few of the illustrations show this work in progress.

As soon as the useless walls were removed the old piers were prepared for the foundation of the steel columns by placing heavy limestone courses on top and then a grille of steel beams bolted together placed longitudinally and filled in solid with concrete. By this means the weight above was distributed from the narrow base of the columns to the old foundation area as nearly as possible.

The steel columns were formed of 15" steel I beams rivetted together, with steel bases and plates and 15" I beams on top, strongly reinforced at the points where the heavy crushing weights would prevail. The ends of the beams were cantilevered over the corner columns, securely rivetted together at the ends and secured on the top with a heavy steel plate cut to the radius of the corner. Upon this plate and system of cantilevers the round corner at Yonge and Richmond street is carried, and there now exists a band of steel beams securely rivetted together extending the full length of the Yonge street frontage, and a portion of Richmond street, which binds the whole together stronger than before. The columns and beams being set in their proper positions, the intervening space between the needles was built up with brick and cement and firmly wedged up with heavy slate wedges and allowed to set perfectly hard before any of the supports were drawn. Each set of beams was sufficiently secured to the existing iron beams by means of steel plates and tie rods with turnbuckles in the centre, so as to tie the old and new steel work together and make a complete connection between the two.

All exposed ironwork was fire-proofed by terra cotta casings and cement fire-proofing, the steel columns being encased in brick and cut-stone to harmonize with the other stone work of the building. The general treatment of the elevations is in harmony with the commercial requirements and restrictions, and do not materially affect the general architectural appearance of the building as a whole. The premises affected by the alterations are fitted up for general business purposes, with attractive fronts and entrances, and were all leased before the works were commenced, showing the monetary value of such an undertaking, and no doubt will continue to increase substantially the revenue of the company, as the location is becoming year by year the commercial centre of the city. I cannot close this brief description without referring to the intense interest taken in the work and the hearty support given me by the workmen on the building. Everyone seemed to realize how much was dependent on him individually. Messrs. Isaac Wardell & Son, who executed the shoring, and Mr. Alexander Marshall, the masons' foreman, were exceptionally careful and painstaking, and all employed entered heartily into the undertaking, determined to make it a success. To this care can be attributed the fact that the works were executed without a single accident of any kind. I mention these facts because it is so unusual to have such general co-operation by the workmen in such an undertaking, they invariably considering

THE ONTARIO ASSOCIATION OF

ARCHITECTS' CONVENTION.

THE convention of the Ontario Association of Architects promises to have matter enough for discussion. A special committee has been at work considering in what ways that are feasible the Association can be made useful. A report from this committee will be presented to the convention, and it is hardly likely that the convention will pass without the enactment of something that will make a decided change in the present condition of affairs. The proposition to have a room down town, in association with another society, is likely to be made, in spite of the lukewarmness with which a similar proposition was met when advanced earlier in the year. The scheme is possible when combined with a proposal to make the registrarship an honorary office. The cost of maintaining a room will be met by the saving in the other department. There can be no doubt that the possession of a local habitation would foster the growth of all associated work that meetings, the reading of papers, exhibitions of pictures, the use of a library, and students' classes and sketch clubs, all of which are the natural functions of a voluntary Association, will have a much better chance of thriving and developing. As a close corporation with power to force culture upon architects, or at any rate upon intending architects, the Association could do good work with a secretary, a board of examiners and a solicitor ; but voluntary efforts require to be drawn out by opportunity and inducement, and the convenience of a room which would accumulate facilities for such efforts would be a great inducement to make them.

It is proposed to hold the convention down town instead of as formerly at the School of Practical Science. This experiment will show whether the convenience of meeting down town will be so great as to offset the privileges that have been enjoyed at the school. It ought to further a full attendance, for the Registrar's office, in which it is proposed to hold the meeting, is in a central position, near all architects' offices and also near the hotels.

All efforts of the Association to increase its effectiveness seem to be aimed at the cultivation of architecture. It's aim is always to do something for architecture; the architect is left to the operation of the law which makes him rise with exaltation of his art. Yet it does seem as if a little attention paid to the commercial well being of architects would turn out to be as potent a stroke as can be made for the advancement of architecture. If a tariff of fees would give greater strength to the commercial position of architects, it would do the art of architecture a lot of good. To look at the matter from the other side If it is true that the architect will rise with the improvement of architecture, it is equally true that architecture will decline with the debasement of the architect. It is to be hoped that, if there is in the report of the special committee no recommendation that there should be an authorized schedule of fees, the proposition will be made by somebody outside of the special committee.
