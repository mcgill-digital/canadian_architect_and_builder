THE tendency of modern architectural practice, as of many other pursuits, is towards centralization in the hands of the best organizers—men who have, with other necessary qualifications, the ability to Secure business and to dispatch it with Such facility as to leave them free to devote a large Share of their time to securing business. Ability of his kind consists of a combination of talent and training for what may be called the business side of the profession. With some there is little development of this faculty. While with some the possibilities in this direction are extremely limited, with others they are neglected. Every architect's assistant who does not wish always to remain such, should be awake to the necessity of studying how to do business. The peculiarities of every transaction he has a chance to observe, should be carefully noted and analyzed. The study of human nature and the adaptation of onesself to his surroundings, so as to be in touch therewith, is most important for the purpose mentioned. Next to this, nothing is more helpful than a good knowledge of the best methods in general office work. A habit of independent thought and a reasonable degree of self confidence should be cultivated. Students and young architects should not be satisfied with learning how to design and build in an artistic and practical manner. To be successful they must learn to handle the necessary business transactions with promptness and good judgment.



THE 16th and 17th of January is the date fixed for the annual convention of the Ontario Association of Architects. This convention, the arrangements for which are already far advanced, gives promise of being one of the most interesting and important in the history of the Association. The advisability of again bringing forward at the approaching session of the Provincial Legislature the proposed Bill to amend the Act of Incorporation of the Association, will be fully considered at this meeting. The opinion largely prevails that no more favorable opportunity of pressing the measure is likely to be afforded during the term of the present House. It is proposed to exhibit at this convention by stereoptican drawings or photographic views of buildings designed by members of the Association with the purpose of eliciting an exchange of friendly criticism. An invitation has been extended to the members to contribute drawings and photographs of their work for this purpose. The result of this new departure will be eagerly awaited, and we cherish the expectation that it will prove to be a most valuable feature of this and future meetings. Papers are promised from Prof. Colelman ,of the School of Practical Science, on Building Stones; from Mr. C. H. C. Wright, Lecturer in Architecture, School of Practical Science, on Cements, based on original tests; from Mr. John Langton, Electrical Engineer, on Electricity Applied to Buildings; from Mr. Hamilton McCarthy, Sculptor, on Sculpture, its Relation and Application to Architecture; an illustrated paper on Architectural Rendering, by a student of the School of Practical Science, and four short papers on subjects not yet specified, from members of the Association. From the foregoing it will be seen that a programme of unusual interest is being provided. In order that the convention may be an unqualified success, it is required that the members of the Association should support it by their presence.
