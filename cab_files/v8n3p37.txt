THE building season of 1895, about to open, promises to be one of much greater activity in Ontario at least than that of 1894. The recent extensive fires will create a considerable local demand for labor and material in Toronto. This will apply in a lesser degree to London, Halifax and other places. The number and extent of new building enterprises seem also to be on a more promising Scale than last year. We therefore bespeak for architects, builders and supply firms the enjoyment of more satisfactory conditions than those which have fallen to their lot of late.



EVER since the <building>Ontario Legislative buildings </building>rose to public view, there has been but one opinion expressed by capable judges concerning their outward appearance, viz., that it displays not a single interesting feature. Occupation of the legislative chamber has demonstrated the fact that its acoustic properties are also of the worst possible character. A daily paper affirms that "The members can't hear each other on the floor of the House, the press is at a great disadvantage for the same reason, while as far as the visitors in the galleries are concerned they might as well be at a pantomime." It seems pertinent to inquire what advantage has accrued to any Canadian interest from the employment of an American architect in the erection of these buildings over the heads of capable home talent.



IN the paper on "English Methods," by Mr. <person>Frank Baker</person>, A. R. I. B A., presented to the 0. A. A. at its last meeting and printed in the present number, the author says "The system of carrying all soil pipes on the outside of outside walls is a good one, and though it is said that our severe climate prevents us from adopting this principle here, it is likely that we will come to it in some form eventually. Perhaps a well ventilated brick flue might be constructed to contain these pipes, but something ought to be done to get them outside of the building." We are heartily in accord with this view. In spite of all the precautions that can be exercised, there exists an element of danger to the inmates of a dwelling in which the damage system forms part of the interior construction of the building. The method of carrying drains outside the walls of dwellings has been followed to a considerable degree of late, and it would add materially to the security of human life if means coul'1 be devised whereby the soil pipe would likewise be relegated to the outside of the building







ABOUT two years ago the Council of London, Eng., decided to abandon the system of submitting to tender the public works of the municipality, and to have them carried out under the immediate supervision of its own officials. By this means it was claimed there would be Saved to the citizens the contractors' enormous profits. The experiment, which has been watched with world-wide interest by municipal bodies and public contractors, seems to have proved a dismal failure. In the case of several costly public improvements carried out under the new method, the cost is shown to have exceeded the estimate of the city officials by 20 per cent., or in round figures £7,200. A quarter of a million pounds has been invested in buildings and contracting plant, which will be practically lost should a return
