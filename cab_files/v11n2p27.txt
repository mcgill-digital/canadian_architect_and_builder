	THE CANADIAN	ARCHITECT AND 



BUILDING OPERATIONS IN 1897.

THE building trade of the year 1897 was not characterized by special activity. In comparison with the previous year there was but a slight gain in the value of buildings erected. Early in the season the outlook was hopeful, but it soon became evident that many new buildings which had been talked of would not be proceeded with. During the latter half of the year the general commercial improvement seemed to wield an influence upon capitalists, and as a result there were a number of buildings commenced late in the fall which are not yet completed. In Toronto some advancement was made, while in Montreal the total expenditure shows a falling off, notwithstanding that the buildings erected were greater in number. One feature of the year was the extent of building in the vicinity of mining operations. At Rat Portage alone it is estimated that there was an outlay on new buildings of three-quarters of a million dollars. The conditions prevailing in British Columbia in the west and the maritime provinces in the east call for no special comment.

Without being considered too optimistic we believe it can safely be said that the outlook for the building trades in 1898 is decidedly better than for several years past. There is a general belief that we have entered upon more prosperous times, this belief being backed up by the high price of agricultural products and the attention that is now being paid to Canada by foreign capitalists. The number of projected buildings in Toronto and other cities stands as a further evidence of this improvement. Some disastrous fires during last year will also assist in swelling the volume of building to the credit of 1898. The most noted of these were at Windsor, N. S., and Casselman, Ont. The loss in the first instance was over one million dollars.



MONTREAL.



In 1896, according to figures furnished by the Building Inspector, there were erected in Montreal 31 buildings, at an estimated value of $1,983,750. Last year, although 408 buildings were erected, the total valuation is placed at $1,414,300, showing a decrease of $569,450. Several projected buildings of considerable importance were not proceeded with. There was an increase in the number of dwellings erected and buildings remodel led, while in the suburbs of the city the season was quite active. In Westmount the total cost of new buildings was $757,950.



During the year the chemical and mining building of McGill University, the gift of Mr. \V. C. McDonald, was carried to completion. It is of Italian Renaissance style, and built of limestone. The Jubilee Nurses' I Home, corner Dorchester and Cadieux streets, is of pressed brick and stone, of Florentine Renaissance architecture. The architect of the above buildings is Mr. A. T. Taylor, F. R. I. B. A. St. John's Baptist church on Rachel street was remodelled and extended, at a cost of $50,000, the architect being Mr. Joseph Venne. This church has since been completely destroyed by fire. Mr. Venne also erected the church of St. Eusebe. Mr. Edward Maxwell, architect, built a large building near Phillips Square for Mr. Joyce, of brick, with bath stone trimmings also a block on Beaver Hall Hill for Mr. McIntyre. A large school is now being completed at the corner of Rachel and Parthenon streets for the parish of St. Gregoire le Thaumaturge, of which Mr. A. Raza is architect. This building is three stories in height, with Laprairie pressed brick front. From the plans of Mr. A. Prefontaine a convent building was erected for the Sisters of Jesus and Mary, at a cost of $22,000.8 several important dwellings were erected by Mr. A. (7. 1 Hutchison, architect.

These figures, in comparison with those of the previous year, show that there were erected last year a larger number of dwellings, factories and warehouses. Some of the best dwellings were erected on St. George Street. The first permit of importance taken out last spring was for the brick warehouse of the T. Eaton Company, corner Albert and Louisa streets, which cost $19,000. The new store and office building of W. & D. Dineen followed. This was erected by Mr. F. H.

A number of new buildings are in sight for 1898, and the outlook is considered good.
