<firm>The Royal Insurance Company, of Liverpool</firm>, has had printed and circulated a form of specification for rendering buildings less liable to destruction by lire. It provides that buildings shall not exceed So feet in height. Above the ground floor glass is to he ¼¼ inch thick in sections not larger that 2 square feet. In the case of wired glass sections are to be not less than 4 square feet. For external walls, brick terra cotta and concrete are to be used. Stone may be employed as facing when backed by not less than 13 inches of brick. On buildings constructed in accordance with this specifications tion, the Company will make a reduction in their rates.



THERE is said to exist a slight

prejudice against the use of spruce

lath on the ground that sometimes they discolor the plaster. Recent inquiries from leading contractors in the Maritime Provinces would seem to disprove this contention. Messrs. <firm>B. Mooney & Sons</firm>, of St. John, write that they have never seen any stain or discoloration from spruce laths, and that, when clear of sap and wane, they give good satisfaction. In the eastern markets, including Boston, New York, and Philadelphia, spruce laths made from slab stock bring higher prices than any other. It is claimed that pine laths containing knots or balsam

will discolor the plaster, whereas this drawback is not met with in the case of spruce. As the merits of spruce laths become more generally known a greater demand for them will develop.



Alarm has been caused the citizens of Glasgow by the discovery that the stone work and especially the costly

carving on the municipal buildings is showing marks of rapid decay. The buildings were erected but a few years ago at a cost of about $2,500,000, stone from a newly opened Bannockburn quarry being used. As a test of the stone it was allowed to lie for a year in the builder's yard before being placed in the building. Although it stood this test satisfactorily, it began to decay in situ. The reason has not been discovered. Much older buildings in the same locality are in a good state of preservation. Instead of cutting out whole capitals of pilasters, as was at one time proposed, only the decayed portions are being cut a way and a silicate solution applied for purposes of preservation. £600 has already been expended on this work.
