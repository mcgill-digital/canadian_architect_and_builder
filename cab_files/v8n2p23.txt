<doctype type="text">lessons to be learned from an examination of the burned structures are

The necessity of thick walls, including party walls; the resting of wooden joists wherever practicable, on corbelling, instead of the ends being built into the wall ; the necessity of fire-proof shutters on all openings which are exposed to risk of fire from adjacent premises ; the unreliability of steel unless thoroughly protected from even a moderate degree of heat, and the necessity of fire-proofing all business premises which exceed a height of about seventy feet.

And now I will not detain you farther from the business for which you have met than to say, that I hope we may enjoy our annual reunion; that the papers and addresses may be as beneficial to the hearers as they have doubtless already proved to those who have so kindly prepared them; that our criticisms and remarks may be uttered in the spirit of frank brotherly kindness, that the occasion may be one of refreshing to us all, and that we shall be encouraged to enter upon another year with fresh impulses towards the highest development of our powers in our noble calling, and with a firm resolve to observe the golden rule in all our dealings with one another.

$217.00. there have also been for new registrations and one registration fee of last year, which colors into this year's accounts.

Students.

Seven new students were registered during the year. There are now 92 students on the list, but of this number there are less than 50 with whom I can feet reasonably sure that I am in actual communication. Some are not in the country; some are, I think, engaged in other work ; some I hear of as practising, having abandoned or postponed the idea of registration. But their indentures are still with me, and I have received front them no notice of their withdrawal from the Association.



Classified according to the examination required of them, the roll of students in subdivided as follows

	For first intermediate examination	14

	For second '	27

	For final examination	51

Proceedings of the Council.

The Council, in order to keep down the running expenses of the Association, met only on the day after the Convention (Jan. 18) and on the morning of the present Convention.

In fulfillment of the Instruction from the Convention In consider the advisability of calling an occasional meeting in Toronto of members of the Association, or of encouraging the formation of a local branch, it was decided to have two lectures in the course of the year, one to be or interest to the public, and one of a more technical nature for members. The first lecture was given on March 8. at the School of Practical Science, by <person>Mr. Helliwell. </person>The lecture was an expansion of his paper on Current Arebluectural Styles read at the Convention. 'and was illustrated by Mr. Wright by a large number of carefully selected views of buildings thrown on a screen by means of the magic lantern. The second lecture was on Graphic Static's, and was given by Mr. Wright on November x6, at the Canadian Institute.

An application was received from the <assoc>Royal Military College Club </assoc>requesting that graduates of the Royal Military College be placed on an equal footing with graduates of the School of Practical science with reference to the requirements of the Association from its students. The question arose whether the Association has the power to grant such a concession. The matter seas referred to the Minister of Education. who decided that it was not within the power of the Association to so enlarge tile scope of the Out. Architects' Act. The Minister expressed himself in favor of granting the concession if found warrantable, and undertook to investigate the character of the work done in the architectural course at the Royal Military College.

Renewed efforts were made during the year to press upon the attention of the Dominion Government the need of an exact method of collecting the customs on foreign plans. Copies of the memorial presented to the Minister of Customs by a deputation from the Association in 1892 were presented again by Members of Parliament representing Toronto. The Controller of Customs replied that the system proposed in the memorial was already in operation.

The Library.

There have been no books added to the Library this year.

The number of lending was III or 41 less than in 1893.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

W.	A. LANGTON, Registrar and Librarian.
