PRICES of many lines of building materials continue to advance. Recent increases include tin plates, galvanized

sheets, window glass for future delivery, varnishes, linseed oil. In sympathy, prices of heating furnaces have also been advanced 10 per cent. Prices have not advanced in Canada in nearly the same degree as in the United States, nor to an extent which should put a check on building enterprise. It is to be hoped that the limit of advance has almost been reached, and that those who have the intention to build the coming- season may not find in the prospect of increased cost cause for hesitation and postponement of operations. It seems reasonably certain that no decline in prices of materials is likely to take place for at least six months to come, and probably not then. Therefore buildings which are to be erected this year should be commenced as soon as possible.



<article title="Canadian Society of Civil Engineers" author="">A NEW and commendable departure was made in connection with the annual convention of the above society

this year. The convention opened in Montreal, where the usual routine business including the election of officers took place This was all disposed of on the first day. The remaining three or four days were spent in Boston in inspecting important engineering works and in fraternizing with the engineers of that city. It is gratifying to note by the address of the retiring president that the membership of the society is rapidly advancing and that its surplus funds have already reached the sum of $10,000 The society is asked to consider ways and means for the profitable expenditure
