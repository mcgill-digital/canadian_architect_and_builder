TO ADVERTISERS.



For the benefit of Advertisers, a copy of this journal is mailed each week to persons mentioned in the CONTRACT RECORD'S reports as intending to build, with a request to consult our advertisement pages and write advertisers for material, machinery, etc.



RECENT tests at the School of Practical Science, Toronto, of Samples of porous terra cotta brick of ordinary red brick size, for use as interior linings of brick and stone walls, are Said to have demonstrated the fact that these bricks have an average ultimate crushing strength of 12 tons per foot, and that a 6-inch arching is sufficiently heavy for ordinary office building construction.



IN the present number is printed the first of a series of articles which will appear regularly in succeeding issues of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, over the nom de plume of " The Bystander.' These articles will be written in the form of notes by a member of the staff of this Journal, and will treat of architectural and kindred matters of current interest. The publisher will appreciate any information which friends of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER may place at "Bystander's" disposal. and which would assist him to give interest and value to his department.



IN our illustration pages will be found portraits of all but two or three of the officers of the British Columbia Institute of Architects. We regret our inability to include in this group portraits of all the officers of the Institute, owing to the failure of some to respond to repeated requests for photographs. After delaying publication for several months in the hope of being able to complete the group, we have been obliged to present it in the somewhat unsatisfactory form in which it appears in this number. Friday, the 2nd of November, has been fixed as the date on which the annual meeting of the Institute will be held in the City of New Westminster. We hope to be able to print in our November number an account of the proceedings.



THE citizens of Montreal are considering whether or not they will hold an Ice Carnival during the coming winter. To those who favor such a project we would say, don't do it. No doubt the festivities of these Carnivals are pleasing to many and attract a large number of visitors to the city, but the advertising usually done for the occasion is of a kind calculated to do Canada more harm than good. It is unfortunately true, that outside of this country the opinion of the majority of people s that we are entitled by climate to the exclusive use of all emblems suggestive of cold weather. This is not more true of Canada than of many other countries. In proof of this statement we can point to the variety of crops that are produced here, including all fruits grown outside of the tropics. There is a habit, altogether too prevalent among our people, of representing life in Canada, or thoughtlessly allowing it to be represented, as if the distinguishing characteristic of the climate were extreme cold with almost perpetual snow and ice. We are all familiar with such representations in many Canadian pictures. We wish to protest against such a setting for Canadian works of art, whether in print, on canvas or in more enduring forms, and would like to see our people and artists in every line co-operating to correct the wrong impressions, which, as stated, are already too widespread. Our aim should be to show Canada to the best possible advantage at every opportunity.
