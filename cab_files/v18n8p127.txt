DO YOU KNOW?

The difference between "SOVEREIGN" RADIATORS and others is that they embody new features in construction and design. We are the most thoroughly practical men in the trade and have spent years in study on the subject of Radiation, and have embodied all the latest features and discarded every weak one known to the trade-â€”that's the answer.

























































"SOVEREIGN" RADIATORS

ARE NEW

	Screwed Nipples	No Bolts



Merit always wins. Leading Architects protect their reputation against prospective danger and trouble by specifying Only Radiators of Actual Merit. This quality is found only in the Sovereign.
