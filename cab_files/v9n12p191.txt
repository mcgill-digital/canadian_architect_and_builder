THE completion of a ten-storey build-Tall Building. ing in Toronto, and the proposal to

erect a fourteen-storey structure on the site of the present St. Lawrence Hall hotel in Montreal, would Seem to be evidence that the craze for tall buildings which has marked Chicago and New York for several years past, is exerting its influence upon the architecture of our Canadian cities. It may not be out of place at this juncture to point out that in the American cities we have named popular favor is being withdrawn from these abnormal specimens of nineteenth century architecture, and legislation has been introduced For the purpose of restricting the height to which buildings may he erected in the future. Another potent influence tending to discourage this style of architecture is that the number of such structures already built so far exceeds the demand that the owners are said to have been compelled to reduce rentals by 50 per cent., while some of the high structures in Chicago which were designed for office purposes are being used as storehouses, in which capacity it will of course be impossible to obtain a fair return on the owners' investment. The unsatisfactory experience of our American neighbors in this direction, coupled with the lower land values in Canadian cities, would seem to render inadvisable the erection of structures exceeding say six or eight storeys in height. ____ ______

been of the most modern type, fitted with so-called safety catches, which in the event of the breaking- of a cable or other accident, are supposed to grip the slides and hold the elevator in place. The accident referred to points to the necessity for protective devices which can be depended on to accomplish their purpose. There is also a greater degree of competency required on the part of persons in charge of elevators. Not only should the employment of lads for this purpose be forbidden, but the man who is placed in charge of an elevator should be required to become thoroughly posted regarding the method of its construction and operation. To illustrate the present condition of knowledge, the writer recently made a few inquiries from a young man in charge of an elevator in a modern office building as to whether there was anything to prevent the elevator from falling in case of accident to the guys. He was assured that there were catches for this pur
