Under the Dominion Companies Act letters patent have been granted to the above company for the purpose of manufacturing building and paving brick and for other purposes more fully set forth. The Company purpose entering into the manufacture of brick by a process that is entirely new, to this country, although it has been introduced for about ten years, with great success, in Germany, Norway and Sweden, and has lately found a strong foot-hold in the United States, there being now four extensive plants there in full operation. As described by Mr. <person>George J. Sheppard </person>of the firm of <firm>Charles Sheppard & Sons </firm>the extensive brick manufacturers of Montreal, who have been known to the building community for the past 45 years, the process is a very simple one though very effective The materials used are sand, - any clear sharp sand and five per cent. of thoroughly slaked lime. The bricks are made on powerful presses similar to those used in the dry press process, but after they leave the press, comes the great difference, instead of the expensive and tedious methods extending to a period of several weeks in drying and burning under which clay or shale brick have to be made, Silicate brick are wheeled on flat cars each holding 2,500 bricks into an immense steel cylinder 6' 6" in diameter and 40 ft. in length containing 10,000 brick. The cylinders are then hermetically closed and live steam introduced at 120 to 150 lbs.

to the square inch. The bricks are allowed to remain under this baking process for twelve hours and are then wheeled out to cool and when cooled are ready for use in any building. A part of the process includes the introduction of tanks under the cars of brick containing fresh lime. The chemical action arising from the steam and lime and the great pressure used hardens the bricks; when exposed to the air they continue to harden becoming virtually a solid mass of silica.

Thc process is fully protected by patents both in Canada and the United States. The Montreal Company have acquired rights to manufacture in the Province of Quebec and will erect a large factory in that city.

Highly satisfactory experiment have been conducted at the establishment of Messrs. <firm>Charles Sheppard & Sons</firm> since last September, and that firm is so thoroughly satisfied the new process is bound to revolutionize the brick industry, that they have taken a prominent part in the organization of the Company and will conduct its future management, dividing the departments between Mr. <firm>George J. Sheppard</firm> and Mr. <person>Edmund Sheppard</person>.

David Robertson</person>, President; <person>George J. Sheppard</person>, Vice-President & Managing Director; <person>Hon.
