be quite accurately determined beforehand by ascertaining the value of t in the equation of the hyperbola, (a + x) y = K, in which (a + x) represents the absorbing capacity of the exposed surfaces in the room together with that of the audience, whilst K is a constant proportional to the volume of the room. The duration of reverberation is thus inversely proportional to the absorbing capacity of the room and its contents. In the case of the Fogg Museum the duration of the sound was successfully reduced from a little over five seconds to about two seconds. For concert halls, a duration of about 2.30 seconds is desirable, to give fulness of tone, whilst three seconds would be too long. For lecture halls a shorter duration is desirable. The New Music Hall at Boston is designed with a duration of audible reverberation of 2.31 seconds.

In answer to questions asked at the end of his lecture, Prof. <person>Cox </person>said that, while Prof. <person>Sabine</person> had treated the question of the form and proportion of a room as of comparatively little importance, it should be remembered that his work so far dealt only with reverberation, and that his further investigations might illustrate the importance of these matters in certain cases. Prof. Cox's own personal experience, in speaking in rooms of different form, led him to believe that the form of the room, its proportions and the position of the speaker had much to do with good acoustics.



<article title=" THE P.Q.A.A. SKETCH CLUB." author="">THE P.Q.A.A. SKETCH CLUB.

The Club held its annual general meeting on the 20 the of December. The Council's report showed that in addition to three preliminary meetings and two visits held in the spring the Club had had ten weekly meetings in the Winter session 1905 including the opening meeting, two lectures, two sketch design competition meetings, three book reviews, one general discussion and an exhibition of measured drawings. Besides the sketch design competitions, two monthly competitions in design had taken place and a prize for measured work awarded. The officers as elected were as follows President<person>, C. S. Burgess</person>, A.R.1.B.A., Vicepres., <person>J. E. Fortin</person>, secretaries <person>Al. Wright </person>and <person>R. Charbouneau</person>, treasurer, <person>F. Peden</person>.

Our ancestors had only a few materials, which they thoroughly understood and used in the most direct and unflinching manner. If they did not know the chemical and physical properties of these materials as well as we do, they had a practical insight into their working, which is of far more importance in design than the most profound analysis.

<article title=" MOVING A BLOCK OF HOUSES " author="">MOVING A BLOCK OF HOUSES.

The construction of an extension to the Thirteenth Regiment Armory, in Brooklyn, N. Y, required the removal of two rows of brick houses adjoining. It was at first proposed to pull them down, but they are being moved bodily to a site 300 feet away but round a corner. One block is already moved, the other is in process of preparation. The work does not differ from other removals except in the size of the mass and in its irregularity. The block moved is about 90 feet long, of buildings stone fronted but not substantially built, erected at different times, with thin double party walls and varying projections in the rear; one house had a three-storey bay window in front. To turn the corner the pushing jacks had to be operated with a greater number of strokes for each unit of distance from the pivotal end. When half way round the process was reversed ; the forward wheeling end became the pivot and the former stationary end was pushed back. After reaching their required position the buildings were lowered 6 feet to place.

A correspondent of Carpentry and Building writes:

I enclose a sketch showing my method of tying a knot































in sash cord. The knot is shown tied loosely in order to clearly indicate the manner in which it is made, but in actual practice the knot is of course tied down against the weight, thereby causing the latter to hang plumb and true.



Men were not born equal, the axiom is false; but each is given a sphere wherein to work. The vessel that holds not water may still hold grain. It matters not so much what a man cannot do as what he can. In the struggle for world-supremacy, it is the fittest that survives and gains the mastery.
