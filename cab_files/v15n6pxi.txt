<person>O. M. Weand</person>, a railroad contractor, of Reading, Pa., has just finished building a house for himself and to commemorate the event, has published an illustrated pamphlet of fifty or more pages containing the criticisms of leading citizens. The title of the book is "The Mistakes I Made in Building a House." Following are some of the criticisms of His friends:



'Of course, you are building the house, but if it were mine, I would run an open porch around the corner so as to connect the two porches.''

''I would l)reter one large window in the second—story front, instead of the double window



"You'll make a mistake if you don't pebble dash the exterior



"You better run the 13-inch walls all the way up. It gets pretty windy out here sometimes.''

''I think the ceilings are two low.''

"My!" How small the rooms are.''

"You ought to be on the other side of the street.''

· 'If it were may house, I would prefer to have t lie cornice several inches higher."

"By all means put a double line of boards on the first floor. It keeps the cellar dust from coming through."

"Those chimney tops look like tomb-stones."

''The lawn steps should have been immediately in front of t lie main entrance."

''Why didn't you set the house in the middle of the lot?"

Personally, I prefer steam heat to the hot water system.'
