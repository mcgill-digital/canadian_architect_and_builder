The Singer buildings new building on Broadway, near Liberty street, which will be 625 feet high, the tallest skyscraper in the city, is to have wind anchors so that it may he firmly braced against every gale.

The wind pressure, on account of the structure's great altitude, will be tremendous, and for that reason the building is to be literally tied to its foundations by an ingenious arrangement of steel rods. They will be three and a half inches in diameter and descend for nearly fifty feet into the concrete which forms the

caissons resting on solid rock eighty. five feet below the curb. The lowest rod has on the end of it a great anchor plate to which it is secured.
