January, 1893	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	7



get it I found it in water. (Poor St. Mark, he is down in that moist sepulchre.) As the hat in its wet state was colder than none, I took it off. My sympathy, under the circumstances, was with the boys, for the spectacle of a man seated on a stool in the middle of the way, with opera glasses continuously elevated, notwithstanding that he was drawing, and with no hat, a red nose and a drop at the end of it, was a sight that to any intelligent boy's mind would require immediate investigation.

These are some of the toils of sketching, but there is still much to he done at night in turning shorthand sketches into drawings; finishing up and putting in order for future use; in reading hooks that will throw light on the present field of work or on one to come; and in writing the diary which is such a burden abroad and such a priceless possession at home.

Under these circumstances, it is questionable whether, with all its discomforts, solitude is not a state of advantage. I had a friend in Venice, an Austrian whom I had met in New York. 1 had his address and went to call early in my stay, hut found him out of town. Subsequent visits at intervals always brought from his housekeeper the same answer, unintelligible except for words which I knew to signify "other town." Finally, just before my departure, I thought I would have a last shot at him, and found him arrived. He took me out in his sandalo -- the Venetian equivalent to a dogcart. Venice suddenly became a new place. Titled persons of different countries were pointed out to me, some of whom I bad observed before, hut they had not appealed to my unprejudiced mind as noble. We took off our hats to two young ladies whose name my companion murmured to me as we approached. I had had a good deal to do with an ancestor of theirs in my meditations among the tombs. He was a Doge of the fifteenth century. It seemed preposterous to find two such pretty young ladies still above ground, and alluded to in simple fashion as the M 's". I hardly know why, but this more than anything seemed to shake the foundations of my life. Afterwards, when I found myself meeting English and American artists at dinner and talking English talk at the English Club it all seemed a matter of course, hut I was glad I had had my fling in solitude

 SIR, — As you do not care to continue this discussion in your editorial pages, kindly insert the enclosed statement in your advertising columns and charge me at ordinary rates. I send this as there are proofs to hack my previous statements which should he made known.

I am, yours faithfully,

<person>C.	H. ACTON BOND</person>.

[In view of the course which one of the parties to the above controversy, whose name, however, has hitherto not appeared, has seen fit to pursue, we feel called upon in our own defence to make an explanation which will place the position of affairs in its proper light before our readers. 'The first letter, published under the nom de plume of "Doric," in reply to Mr. Bond's criticism, and which purported to have been written by some friend of the sculptor whose work had been called in question, was in reality sent to us with a request for its publication by the sculptor himself, Mr. <person>Frederick Turner</person>. A portion of this letter was of such a personal character that it was withheld from publication. Mr. Bond next reasserted the correctness of his statements over his own signature. Following this, on the opposite side of the controversy, came a letter from <person>Mr. Watson</person>, the City Building Inspector, which began with the following remarkable statement:

"In reply to young (Mr.) Bond's communication of the 22nd of October last, in reply to mine which you previously published." Here it will he observed Mr. Watson distinctly claims to he the author of the letter signed 'Doric." which, as above stated, was written by Mr. Turner. It rests with Mr. Watson to explain and the reader to judge what induced him to make a statement so directly contrary to the fact. Seeing that on one side the controversy was being unfairly conducted, we announced that it must close-A few days after the publication of this decision a letter reached us from Mr. Bond, in which he stated that he had proof of the correctness of his statements, and as his veracity had been challenged he thought we should allow him the privilege of substantiating his position. While recognizing the force of this appeal, we replied that we felt bound to stand by our decision, publicly announced, not to allow the controversy to proceed further, and the only way in which further publication could be secured would he by advertisement, to be paid for at the usual rates. After having informed Mr. Bond to the above effect, we received a personal letter from Mr. Turner, in which he charged Mr. Pond with having used his position as a correspondent of this journal to vent his spite and injure his (Mr. Turner's) reputation as a sculptor. He also forwarded to us a tracing from Mr. Bond's drawing, lettered "Motive for carving, to he executed in bold relief," the ridiculing of which he claims induced Mr. Bond to make a "spiteful" attack upon his work. In this letter he said, "it will be only fair to your old subscriber and advertiser that the impartial criticism (of the sketch) he (Mr. Bond) asks for should be given by you, showing as it must the animus that prompted his attack on myself." We replied that we must decline to be in any way personally .drawn into the controversy,—that being in a position to judge impartially, and from personal conversations with Mr. Bond on the subject, we had reason to believe that his criticism was not prompted by personal feeling, and that regarding the value and appropriateness of the suggestion contained in Mr. Bond's sketch for the carver, an architect who is a member of the R. I. B. A.. on examination of the tracing said, that presuming the sculptor to he familiar with the various orders 'f architecture, he considered the sketch sufficient by way of suggestion. This letter was written in the most friendly spirit with the hope of inducing Mr. Turner to rightly view the situation. We regret that this desirable end was not achieved, as the following brief epistle, received a day or two later, will show: "Dear Sir, — Be good enough to discontinue my subscription to the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER and also my advertisement in your paper at expiration of contract." We are always glad to he of service to our subscribers and advertisers, but not in the direction which Mr. Turner seems to desire. — EDITOR C. A. & B.1

<article title=""CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER" COMPETITION

FOR A CITY HOUSE." author=" FRANK DARLING, JOHN GEMMELL,



A.	FRANK WICKSON ">

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,— In compliance with your request we have examined the competition plans for "a city house," and herewith present our report.

We 'have given first place to the one under the norn de plume of" New Year," and the second place to "Etudiant." We beg to say in connection with this decision that the author of the first prize design would do well to give more attention to the rendering of his drawings. We regret having to criticize rather severely the top story of the second prize design, it being very inferior to the rest of the work. It is very bad judgment to break back the wall of the entire story for the purpose of getting up the two paltry gables; the roof construction is also bad; the planning is very good ; the rendering is well done and would reproduce easily ; the pier at the east side of drawing room bay is too light.

Several of the competitors, viz.: "Utile Dulci," and 'Palmer Perniex," violated the requirements of the competition by making buildings with two stories and an attic instead of three c/ear stories.

In the design submitted by "Chauer" the plan of the entrance has been sacrificed to the exterior. The drawing room lacks shape, being too symmetrical and formal to have good effect; the light well at west side would be absolutely useless, being barely two feet wide, and with the wall of another building built on the line the lavatories, back stairs and bath room, would be practically dark. A billiard room only 11' o" wide would be useless. The design is much too expensive for the appropriation. The drawings were not on the right sized paper. The draughtsmanship is quite clever and the drawings are very ship-shape.

"Utile Dulci " has sent in a well drawn set of plans and very

· well designed elevations, though not complying with the conditions. The plan is somewhat defective. Neither the reception room nor parlor is large enough to make a good room. Two main entrances to the one hall are not good; the mere fact of having one at the side does not make it in any way beneficial. A guest coming in one door and being let out the other would he liable to considerable confusion. Nothing is gained by cutting off the corners of the dining room. The kitchen door is too directly opposite the door to main hall. The back staircase and the first floor passage are dark.

The plan submitted by "Palmer Perniex" is good, though both staircases would be very dark. The esat elevation would be quite effective, but does not conform to the conditions.

The general lay-out of the house designed by "Incog" is rather good, but most of the rooms are much too small for a house of that character, the kitchen and bath room particularly so. The connection between kitchen and dining room is too direct and the doors too close together. Nothing has been gained and much lost by receding the pantry wall to give a north light to the dining room. The simple style of the elevations might be made to look very well, but to carry it out properly more study would be required.

There is one set sent in without a motto by a painstaking competitor, but the amount of work spent on his drawings could be much more judiciously applied. We would suggest that the author of it should study some good examples of rendering, and he would also do well to devote considerable time to practising printing, it being of great advantage to be able to print well and rapidly.

Yours very truly,

<person>FRANK DARLING</person>, <person>JOHN GEMMELL</person>,
