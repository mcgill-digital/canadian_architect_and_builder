<article title="No Teutonic Art" author="">NO TEUTONIC ART



THE art we call Teutonic is really Byzantine. The tribes which were planted on the various frontiers of the empire, and were largely in its service, were all directly indebted to Byzantium for their art. Hence while we find the same art, with slight Local differences, among the Goths of the Crimea, the Lombards in Italy, the Burgundians in Austria and Switzerland, the Alemani on the Rhine, the Merovingians in Gaul, the Angles and Saxons in Britain, the Visigoths in Spain, the Vandals in Africa, and the early Scandinavians in Denmark and Scandinavia. The cloisonné jewelry, the interlaced dragon patterns, etc., all of which have such a common likeness, have an equally common likeness with the work which we can trace to the Queen of bosporus. and, as Lindenschmidt was never tired of preaching, there

is no Teutonic art. The art of all the Teutonic tribes who founded the modern States of Europe was in reality the art of Byzantium, and this was so in later times also. The art of the Carlovingian Empire, and of the later Anglo-Saxons, was the art of the exarchate of Ravenna, just as the art of Southeastern Europe, as preserved in the churches of Kief, was the direct daughter of Constantinople.—Sir Henry Howarth, in The Anti

quarry.	_______________________



So far from stenciled effects in wallpaper losing their popularity they are unquestionably gaining ground, and those who admire them most are those whose taste is best cultivated. The design of a wallpaper based on stencils is as artistic and effective as any, provided, of course, that proper care is taken in the selection of colors.



A writer on painting states that the ochre best suited for the purposes of the house-painter will show an analysis about as follows: Hydrated oxide of iron 45 per cent.. Silica 35 per cent., Alumina 20 per cent.

Yellow is the Chinese imperial color, not to be desecrated by common use. Imperial buildings are roofed with yellow tiles. The Pekin Gazette is issued in a yellow cover; the national flag has a yellow ground ; and the Emperor's own robe is of yellow silk, embroidered with a gold five-clawed dragon.
