<article title=" ARCHITECTURE AT THE S. P. S." author="">ARCHITECTURE AT THE S. P. S.



There are six students of architecture in course at the School of Practical Science, in the first and second years.





The new Y.M.C.A. building in Vancouver is well under way, the outer walls are tip and the roof in place. The general design of the building is now evident. One of the most important features is the gymnasium which is one of the largest in Canada being 60 feet long and 50 feet wide the ceiling being 20 feet high. The building will be heated and ventilated by the Plenum System, and ducts running to every part of the building, keeping temperature at the proper degree. By the Plenum system, warm fresh air is supplied through these ducts to every part of the building- from an electrically driven fan in the basement. Mr. E. E. Blackmore is the architect of the building and Mr. A. E. Carter the contractor in charge of the work.

The Don Valley Brick Works

are now manufacturing
