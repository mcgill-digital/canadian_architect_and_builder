cient Greece and the Middle Ages. One of the conditions brought about by the rapid growth of our cities is the necessity for more floor space within a limited area, and in order to accomplish this buildings of graded heights have been erected, finally culminating in the modern skyscraper. For the solution of these problems it was necessary to appeal to the engineer; and mark how carefully, step by step, he has dragged us with him into the vortex at the imminent risk of losing our reputation—our fair heritage of centuries of standing. (Hear, hear). No sooner was the problem of the seven story building solved than he insinuatingly suggests ten, and so on, worming his way insidiously, Uriah Heep fashion, until finally he takes the reins out of our hands and is dragging us, wither knows, ever onward, higher and higher, our fates indissolubly linked together, For each art is interdependant. He ruthlessly tramples all our aesthetic feelings under foot, turns a deaf ear to all our cries and protestations, and as already pointed out to him by someone, he looks not upon the sanitary aspect of this question—the damp, unwholesome and

microbe-laden air, which must lurk in the deep ditches of streets between these mountainous structures, the dark, untenable, uninviting offices of the ground floor and the congested condition of the sidewalks, when the vertical carrying

capacity exceeds the horizontal. But there is no turning hack in his mad career: his day has come and he is stung to greater madness, when he thinks of the long-continued sway of the noble art of architecture. Why cannot his profession be characterized a noble art? And in his hallucination he drags his now passive brother to his destruction, until finally he lands him, a drivelling, ornamental draughtsman to pilaster, and be-cornice and drape his awful Eiffel Towers. (Laugher and applause). Gentlemen, I think our heartiest thanks are due Professor Wright for his paper and in moving this vote of thanks I take this opportunity, now that we are all assembled together, to make mention of the deep interest he takes in this Association-a working interest, not a passive interest, that costs but little. He is always willing to saddle himself with work and the thorough manner in which he goes



The Samson Cordage Works, of Boston, arc sending out a very neat desk calendar, showing sample of their cord, and table of sizes anci weights.



We have received from The B. Greening Wire Co., Limited, Hamilton, an advance copy of their annual calendar for 1902, which no doubt will be much appreciated.
