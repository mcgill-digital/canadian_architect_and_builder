The Peterboro Radiator and Boiler Co: has been organized with a capital of $40,000 to manufacture a heater invented and patented by Mr. R. G. Sturgeon, plumber, of that city.

Rear-Admiral Bowles, the new chief constructor, seems to be unalterably opposed to the use of fireproofed wood in the American navy. His objections to the wood are its non-durability, its tendency to sweat, and its chemical action on iron and brass in contact with it. It may be added that the British Admiralty is more than favorably disposed to the use of such wood. The question has not yet been finally decided, so far as the United States navy is concerned, and before Secretary Long takes action in the matter, it is understood that he will probably refer the subject to the Board of Construction at Washington.
