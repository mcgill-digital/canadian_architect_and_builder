The Treasurer, in submitting the accompanying statement, has to report that all outstanding accounts for the year, as far as presented, have been paid. The expenditure ($314.72) is $128.28 less than last year. This saving has been made up, principally, by the reduction in the salary of the Registrar of $100. The receipts, amounting to $375.40, including bank interest, are $187.05 greater than last year. The increase in thc receipts is due to the payment of arrearages by a large number of members who were in danger of having their names left off the register. The fees received for 1898 amount to $86. The balance in the bank is $1,082.46, being an increase over last year of $60.68. The following is a comparative statement of the income and expenditure for the past three years

Respectfully submitted, 

EDMUND BURKE, Treasurer.



In presenting the report, the Treasurer drew attention to the increased amount received from members' fees, and pointed out that this was owing the fact that a number of members who were in arrears for some time back had paid up, and therefore the deficit was less than it would otherwise have been. '[his payment of back fees was something, however, which might not occur again, and he thought the Association was fast approaching the time when they must revert to the order of things which existed before incorporation,

when all services were honorary. Unless something could be done to enlarge the membership roll or increase the fees, to continue in the present course would be suicidal, as there was year by year a decrease in the amount of the balance in hand, and in a few years at most they would find themselves without funds. He could therefore see no other course than to revert to the plan of having no paid officers, if the balance they ought to maintain was to he preserved.

The President agreed that it would he necessary to take some such action as that suggested by Mr. Burke. Although this year the receipts were slightly in excess of the expenditure, owing to the causes explained by the Treasurer, it would be impracticable to continue much longer on the present lines.

The Registrar, Mr. Langton, pointed out that if all the members in arrears paid up there would still be a considerable lump sum to come in ; but the regular annual income from the membership fees and other sources would on the present reckoning amount to about $328, which was too close to the expenditure.

On motion by Mr. Siddall the report was then received and adopted.

The report of the Registrar and Librarian was then read by Mr. Langton, as follows

REPORT OF REGISTRAR AND LIBRARIAN.



MEMBERS..—Pursuant to the recommendation of the last Convention the Council omitted from the list of members printed in 1898 the names of those who were in arrears for the annual fee for a longer period back than 1896. Members so in arrears were notified by registered letter that their names would be omitted from the list if their arrears were not paid up to this point. The membership as thus printed numbered 37 non-resident members, 29 resident members and 6 travelling members; in all 72 members. Since the list was printed one non—resident member has died.

STUDENTS.---There have been three students registered. The examinations were held in March. The board of Examiners was, Prof. Galbraith (Chairman), Messrs. C. H. C. Wright, S. G. Curry, R. J. Edwards, W. R. Gregg, Grant Helliwell, W. L. Symons, S. H. Townsend, A. F. Wickson, and the Registrar. There were two students examined; one for the First Examination, who was allowed a supplemental examination, but has not yet come up for it; and one for the Final Examination, who was plucked.

PROCEEDINGS OF THE COUNCIL.—The resolution of the Convention requesting the Ontario Government to place a sum of not less than $5000 at the disposal of the School of Practical Science, for the purpose of making such tests of Canadian building materials as will furnish reliable data for use in the building trades, was duly forwarded to the Government through the Hon. Minister of Education. The Minister, in reply, said that the recommendation is worthy of careful consideration, but that, as the House had risen, no money could be voted until the next session. There was a formal session of Parliament in the summer, but no general business was transacted. The Council have amended the by-law relating to Student's Fees, Article 3, to read

The fee for examination shall be $10,00 for each examination and $2.00 for each supplemental examination. This by-law to affect students registered after January :4th, 1897. Two competitions which took place during the year, one at Stratford and one at St. Thomas, were brought to my notice by members of the Association as having unsatisfactory conditions and, as instructed by the President, I wrote to the promoters of the competitions to endeavor to procure amendment of the unsatisfactory clauses of the conditions in accordance with the Association model of conditions of competitions which I enclosed. In each case I was told that the competition was too far advanced for a change in the conditions to be possible.

The LIBRARY.—There have been 42 lendings among 19 borrowers. Additions to the library have been Building Construction and Superintendence, Part II., by F. S. Kidder; Specifications, by W. F. Bower; Lectures and Lessons on Art, by F. W. Moody.



On motion by Mr. Wickson, seconded by Mr. Baker, the report was received and adopted.

The President's address was then read as follows



PRESIDENT'S ADDRESS.



GENTLEMEN OF THE ONTARIO ASSOCIATION OF ARCHITECTS:

In welcoming you to this our eleventh annual convention, I am glad to he able to congratulate you upon the present prospects of increasing prosperity in most branches, at least, of our work. But I regret to say, I am forced to admit that, in connection with the Association itself, the outlook is not so bright.

Three years ago a former president (Mr. Darling, I think) stated that the Association practically numbered among its members every person following the profession of architecture within the province. Since then there has been a considerable falling off in our membership, and not a few young men have opened offices, and begun practice, without having passed the examinations necessary to entitle them to become members of the Association ; I doubt if thc present register contains the names of more than two-thirds of those now practising in Ontario.

There are, however, some grains of encouragement In Que
