PACIFIC COAST WOODS FOR PORCH COLUMNS.

The following paper on "Pacific Coast Woods for

Porch Columns'' was read before the Pacific Coast

Lumber	Manufacturers' Association	at of semi-annual meeting held at Tacoma, July 26-27, by August

Von Boccklin, of the Washington Manufacturing

Company, of Tacoma:

It is apparent the Eastern manufacturers have not been alive to their opportunities, and have confined their operation to very limited areas, whereas their Western competitors and Eastern distributing houses have not been so slow in perceiving it was possible to develop extensive business in porch columns made of Western woods, notably those produced in the so-called North Pacific coast region. Regardless of the conditions existing in the thickly populated sections of the country, which may or may not be responsible for what has transpired, the fact remains that every large Eastern jobber now carries stocks of porch columns made of Washington woods. Opinions differ as to which is the most desirable, some concerns insisting on obtaining nothing but cedar columns, others recommending spruce but the great majority are now educated to the use of fir porch columns, having doubtless discovered the virtues of our leading wood in the way of durability. superiority in grade, quality, strength, economy in the matter of prices, and—last lint not least— the enormous resources upon which to draw for supply.

Actual service is rapidly demonstrating the fact that few woods are so well adapted to porch columns as our Washington fir, and we are to be congratulated that this is the case, on account of the enormous quantity of Douglas fir available,

Being exposed more than any other part of the structure to the atmospheric changes, it is essential that the porch columns be made of material which will withstand the elements, and at the same time be sufficiently hard to withstand abuse the wood of which the columns are to be made must necessarily possess the commercial advantages which have been touched upon in the foregoing paragraphs, and must be of such a character as to enable the manufacturer to shape it with ordinary cutting tools and deliver to the consumer in the finished state fit to receive paint and retain a smooth surface once in the hands of the consumer it is highly essential that the wood resist to a reasonable extent the process of disintegration which occurs so rapidly in Eastern woods, particularly poplar. This is sketching briefly the fir column as it is
