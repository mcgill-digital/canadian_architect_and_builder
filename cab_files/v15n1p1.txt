office in Toronto, and it would be well to consider the question of changing in a fundamental manner the whole administration of building inspection. At the present stage of the city's growth, and even more in consideration of the growth that is coming on, it is important that the Department should be a Department of Architecture, and that the head Of

it should be an architect highly trained in modern methods of construction, and able to keep up with new ideas. A permanent official of this character, to amend and keep amended the building by-law, and to carry it out intelligently, would be worth a good salary for he would represent great possibilities for the city. It is essential to have a man who is big enough to be at ease under his responsibilities, or the authority given to him will degenerate into a wretched administration of red tape. But if he is big enough he will do much to foster a good class of building in the city.



The Exhibition by-law of Toronto having become law, brings into the region of realities the problem of

improving the Fair grounds. The argument for the by-law was that a successful Fair is an advantage to the city, and for this purpose new buildings were required. The main building was not rain proof, and

the first consideration, which outweighs all others, is therefore plain and practical—to protect the exhibits and if the building is made fairly presentable, as the plainest and most practical member of the Exhibition Association will desire it to be, so much will have been accomplished, as compared with the present state of affairs, that the Association may reasonably rest from its labors and say that, as the Exhibition did well before, now, with new and improved buildings, it is safe. But the attractiveness of a Fair from the point of view of beauty, which is already accepted as essential to success, does not depend only upon its buildings. Good buildings and large buildings are essential to give adequate motive for the scene, and an imposing background ; but the beauty and the real attractiveness of the Fair lies in the way the buildings are placed and the treatment of the spaces between them. Here is a field for the sort of charm that makes the Fair a sort of recreation ground for visitors, who care little about the exhibits. The possibilities are great and varied, and cost in comparison with the buildings, little but thought. What can be done to improve the grounds as well as the buildings? To hold its own the Fair must meet the taste that has grown up for this sort of thing. It is not really in a safe position if only the buildings are improved. The difficulty is in the number of fixed conditions that exist. But the alterations that are to be made, and in particular the
