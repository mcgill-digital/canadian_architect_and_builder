several balconies are reached from above downwards by suitable iron stairways, while the last flight leading to the level of the street is hinged at top, remaining up until in case of fire or panic it is released by a mere pressure of the foot and then falls to level of roadway.

Mr. Baillarge further suggests that any legislation dealing with this important matter, should contain a proviso that '' any boiler for the purpose of heating the building, or lighting it or for other service, as of elevators, etc., be situated without the building in a separate wing, so that in case of explosion, it may not jeopardize the building itself but confine its depredations to the wing in which it is erected."

It is to be hoped that Mr. Baillarges petition will receive from the governments to which it is addressed the measure of consideration which its importance demands.

ARCHITECTURAL COURSE OF THE MONUMENT NATIONAL.



As every Montrealer is aware a series of twenty lectures arc given each winter at the Monument National. The first fifteen of these are devoted to the theory of construction and the remainder to archaeology. These are specially intended for architectural students and those generally interested in construction. This year the professor has at his disposal over 400 lantern slides of the principal monuments of tile world.

The course which is given every Tuesday is free for all. Mr. J. Venne, Architect, who was the professor up to this year, has  reigned in favor of Mr. Eugene Pavette.

BUILDING INSPECTORS DEPARTMENT.



Since the departure of Mr. Lacroix from the head of this department Mr. Chausse, a member of the Architectural Association, has had charge and great changes can already he seen. Where lack of business like methods reigned, now order and method are to he found and a material addition to the treasury the natural result. The annual report will be produced at the end of the month hut the following items were procured.

	1900.	Number of permits.	Value.

	January	3	$ 6.00

	February	4	8.00

	March	5	10.00

	April	3	6.00

	May	22	44.00

	June	77	154.00

	July	32	64.00

	August	49	98.00

	September	27	54.00

	October	51	102.00

	November	16	32.00

	December	16	32.00



As Mr. Lacroix was in power to the end of April it can easily be seen that the changes have been very considerable, and how the committee even allowed a report to be issued with 3 4, 5 and 3 permits that is 15 buildings, for 4 months, seems past com

pretension. The following list of the work of this department for the past ten years has been compiled by Mr. Chausse and some interesting facts are disclosed thereby

	Year.	Income.	Buildings erected.

	1890	S297.00	937	$3,308,606

	1891	290.00	778	3,358,400

	1892	179.00	640	2,598,825

	1893	327.00	561	2,835,800

	1894	303.00	382	1,634,900

	1895	237.00	277	1,532,900

	1896	230.00	315	1,983,750

	1897	288.00	408	1,414,300

	1898	241.00	351	1,729,150

	1899	307.00	357	2,370,080

	1900	1051.00	432	2,670,903



In 1890, it will he seen, there were 937 buildings erected and vet there was only a revenue of $297.00, and in 1900 there were only 432 buildings erected, yet the revenue was $1051.00 or nearly four times as much with not half the number of buildings erected. Mr. Lacroixs office must have been a lucrative one and he will not be missed by those interested in the welfare of the city. A portion of the revenue this year has been from the license charged on woodyards these, it appears, were never collected by Mr. Lacroix, and we would suggest that the license be raised to $20.00 as the woodyards are a great menace to the city from a fire standpoint, and they also greatly diminish the value of all property adjoining The present license of $3.00 is certainly ridiculously low.

Beside tile improvement above noted in the Building Inspector's Department of this city, there have been various signs of changes for the better in other departments, a large proportion of which can be placed to tile credit of Alderman Ames, who has spent a considerable amount of his time and his inexhaustible energy towards the purifying of the city council. For instance take the sanitary inspectors who were recently in made to undergo examinations for their qualifications to hold the positions ill which they found themselves. The following were the questions asked and it may be fairly said that they were not likely to stagger any person who could possibly be considered qualified as a sanitary Inspector, and vet out of thirteen who were examined only four were able to gain 7016037f marks or over



1.	Describe the manner in which a test is made with oil 



peppermint and with smoke in order to see whether a new drain is without apparent defect.



What is the law regarding the ventilation of water closet apartments? What style of closet is permitted and what prohibited under the present byâ€”law ?

3.	If a room is If) feet long-, 12 feet wide and 10 feet high what would be the cubic contents, and how many adults could sleep in a room of this size?



4.	What does the present by-law describe as a properly constructed privy pit, and where only are such permitted to exist ? Is it permissible to connect it with a sewer, and if not, why not ?



5.	How should a house be constructed in regard to size and material of drains, and the prevention of siphonage?

6.	What is the present state of your own sanitary district as regards, nuisances, privy pits and dirty lanes ? Give approximately the number dealt with by you during the present year.



7.	What methods would you suggest for tile improvements of the Montreal water supply ?

8.	How can you detect the existence of gas leaks ? How would you take a sample of air for analysis ?

9.	In the case of a patient suffering from a contagious disease and removed to the civic hospital, describe two methods by which the sick room and contents may be thoroughly disinfected.

10.	If upon your arrival at a house to be disinfected you are met with objections on the part of the inmates, state briefly the chief arguments you could use to convince them of the necessity for routine disinfection after contagious disease.

Anyone who could not gain over of marks on the above paper dill hardly be called a suitable person for a large city's sanitary inspector, and it shews plainly how timely the examination has been. These remarks are intended to emphasize the necessity of those interested in hygiene and sanitary science (and who should be more so than architects) to do all in their power to raise the standard ill this city. The present building by-laws and plumbing by-laws are very lax, and it is high time that the present council should pass tile new by-laws, made up after serious work on the part of a committee appointed by the Architectural Association. Surely something might be done to bring the importance of this question before the council, and one might suggest that a strong deputation be sent to the council,
