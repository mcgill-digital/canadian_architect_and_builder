THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	February, 1893



Messrs. <person>Darling</person>, <person>D. B. Dick </person>and <person>Edwards</person> had been elected to the Council.

Mr. <person>Symons </person>then moved that the Council be recommended to elect Mr. D. B. Dick to the office of President.

Mr<person>. Kay </person>seconded the motion.

Mr. <person>Townsend</person>, While expressing himself fully in sympathy with the result of the balloting, and the recommendation it was desired to make, did not think in the present state of the Act it would be a proper course to adopt ; he objected to the principle.

The President said if that was the case the motion would have to be dropped, as there was no power on the part of the Association to pass such a motion.

Mr. Symons being desirous, on account of the delicate health of his partner in business, to relinquish the duties of auditor, it was moved by Mr. <person>Gordon</person>, seconded by Mr. Burke, that Messrs. <person>Langley</person> and <person>Gemmell</person> be the auditors for the coming year. Carried.

Mr. <person>Baker</person> inquired if it was not in order now to nominate the committee to assist the Council in the legislation which was being sought.

Mr. Townsend asked if it had not been decided that the Council should appoint members of that committee.

The Registrar said the sense of the meeting, at the time the question Was being discussed was, that the selection should be made by the Convention, but no vote was taken on the subject.

The President said it was better to have a vote on the subject, which being taken, it was found that the meeting favored leaving the appointment in the hands of the Council.

The President remarked that he felt it incumbent upon him to thank the Association for the unlimited confidence they seemed to repose in the Council.

During the progress of the balloting for members of the Council, the Registrar read a paper contributed by Mr<person>. R. C. Windeyer</person>, which was listened to by those present with marked interest. At its Close a vote of thanks, moved by Mr. Townsend, and seconded by Mr. <person>Belcher</person>, was accorded to Mr. Windeyer. This paper, owing to lack of space, is held over for future publication.

On motion of Mr. Baker, seconded by Mr<person>. Power, </person>the thanks of the Association were tendered to Hon. <person>G. W. Ross </person>and the Faculty of the School of Practical Science, for the use of the building, and the courtesy extended to members by Prof. <person>Galbraith </person>and Mr. <person>Wright</person>.

On motion of the Registrar, seconded by Mr. Burke, a vote of thanks to the retiring Auditor, Mr. Symons, was carried.

On motion of Mr. <person>Gregg</person>, the Registrar took the chair, and a vote of thanks was then tendered to the President, amid hearty applause.

On motion of Mr. Belcher, seconded by Mr. <person>Arnoldi</person>, the Convention then adjourned sine die.



A NEW DEPARTURE.



The suggestion was made in this journal that an exhibit of materials employed in building construction Would form an interesting and instructive feature in connection with the annual convention of architects.

The idea was this year taken hold of by Mr. <person>Taylor</person>, manager of the <firm>Toronto Radiator Manufacturing Co</firm>., who invited and received the co-operation of the following firms: The <firm>Gurney Foundry Co</firm>., <firm>James Morrison</firm>, <firm>Rice Lewis & Son</firm>, <firm>Warden King & Son</firm>, the <firm>Steel Clad Bath & Metal Co</firm>., and the <firm>Canadian General Electric Co.

</firm>The architects were given an invitation to make an inspection of the establishments of the firms mentioned on the day following the close of the convention, which invitation was largely accepted.

Entering sleighs at half-past nine in the morning, they were conveyed first to the extensive manufactory of the Gurney Foundry Co., on King street west, through which they were personally conducted by Mr. <person>Edward Gurney </person>and Mr. <person>Carrick</person>, the manager. They were shown the various styles of hot water boilers, radiators, etc., manufactured by the company and had explained to them as far as the time at their disposal would allow the details of construction.

The next stopping point was the factory of the <firm>Toronto Radiator Mfg. Co</firm>., on Dufferin street, Where with a few words of welcome they were received by Mr. Taylor, the manager, who explained that the establishment was the most extensive in America manufacturing only radiators. Beginning With the show room where finished radiators in variety of design and adapted for almost every conceivable position were exhibited, the visitors were guided through the various departments and shown the methods employed in their manufacture. In many respects these were similar to those already witnessed, but in a few important particulars, as for example the method of jointing the sections of radiators, they differed.

It was a matter of observation in both establishments that the utmost thought and attention are given to perfecting the article manufactured, while at the same time by means of labor saving machinery and devices reducing to the lowest possible point the cost of production.

At Messrs. Rice Lewis & Sons' extensive hardware establishment on King street east the company next alighted, and were shown the newest things in this important department of interior finish. Amongst these were locks of the finest quality and

mechanism, door finishings of aluminum, and bronze goods with sand-blast finish and having pleasing variation in color, and which the visitors were assured would never tarnish. These goods are excellent in design and are adapted to the principal architectural styles.

Fifteen minutes after leaving this interesting establishment, the company found themselves not less interestingly employed In discussing amid artistic surroundings, the merits of one of Webb's choicest menus. The proceedings were presided over by Mr. Taylor, having on his left Mr. Gurney, and on his right Mr. <person>Curry.</person>

Due appreciation having been shown to "material" things, brief speeches were made by the chairman, and by Messrs. <person>Gurney</person>, <person>Lee</person> (of Rice Lewis & Son)<person>James Morrison</person>, Gregg, of Warden King & Son, <person>Booth</person>, of the Steel Clad Bath & Metal Co., <person>Andrews</person>, of the General Electric Co., and <person>Cassidey</person>, Secretary of the Canadian Manufacturers' Association.

On behalf of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, Messrs. Curry and Burke expressed appreciation of the hospitality of the manufacturers and of the opportunity of acquiring information which had been afforded to the members. Mr. Curry took occasion also to thank the <assoc>Manufacturers' Association </assoc>for the assistance which they had given at Ottawa to the deputation of architects which some months ago waited on the Government to urge that a proper duty be imposed upon the plans of foreign architects. He hoped that in any future efforts which the architects might make in this direction they would have the support of the manufacturers.

It was pointed out by some of the manufacturers present that American and not Canadian materials had usually been employed in buildings erected in Canada by American architects, and that in consequence the manufacturers were directly interested with the architects in endeavoring to have the present condition of things remedied.

Mr. Gurney was of the opinion that the remedy would only be found in the passing of a contract law similar to the alien labor law existing in the United States. The architects were assured of the support of the manufacturers in their endeavors to secure the enforcement of a more equitable tax on foreign plans.

After a couple of hours had been pleasantly and profitably spent the round of inspection was resumed.

In the establishment of the Steel Clad Bath Co., on Queen street east, was found a young, rapidly developing and prosperous industry, vigorously managed and equipped with every facility for achieving the maximum of efficiency at the minimum of cost. The enterprise of the company extends also to the other side of the line, another factory being located in Detroit, from which the American market is supplied.

Considerable time was spent to advantage in going through the various departments of Mr. James Morrison's brass manufacturing concern, on Adelaide street west, it being one of the largest of its kind on the continent.

The show rooms of Messrs. Warden King & Son, of Montreal, manufacturers of the well known "Daisy" hot water boiler, are situated on the opposite side of the Street, and here a pleasant half hour was spent. This agency is in change of Mr. <person>Fairbairn.</person>

A visit was likewise made to the offices and show rooms of the General Electric Co., at 95 Front street west, where a handsome exhibit of electric fixtures was shown.

The manufacturers having engaged a section of the theatre for the benefit of the visitors, quite a number witnessed the Duff Opera Company's performance of "The Basoche."

This closed a day of unusual interest, and so agreeable and profitable did the occasion prove to all who participated, that we are assured the first attempt in this direction is likely to be repeated at regular intervals in the future





PERSONAL.

Mr. <person>D. B. Dick</person>, Treasurer of the 0. A. A., is at present in Europe.



Mr. <person>J. A. Pearson</person>, of the firm of <firm>Darling, Sproatt & Pearson</firm>, architects. Toronto, is in St. Johns, Nfld., where the firm have secured considerable work,

Messrs. <person>Edmund Burke </person>and <person>W. R. Strickland </person>have been appointed representatives of the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Guild </assoc>on the Toronto Technical School Board,

<person>Robert. J. McCallum</person>, architect, son of <person>Robert McCallum</person>, engineer of the Public Works Department of Ontario, died at his father's residence, Toronto, on the 12th inst.



The dead black finish which so often is used for cast iron backs and jambs for fireplaces. as well as for the ornamental iron work sold by the grate manufacturers, is not only always much admired, but it is quite durable as well, Painters are frequently asked to finish old iron work, that is to be repaired, in the same way. but they almost always look upon it as some secret process, the knowledge of which seems to be confined to the heater men. The process is really neither difficult nor secret, but is simply not a paint at all. The iron is first of all bellied to redness and then plunged into a bath of linseed oil, Sonic of the oil appears to unite with the iron on the surface in some way, to form a chemical compound, similar in a measure to the black oxide produced by the Bower-Barff process. Another portion seems to be actually baked upon the surface of the iron, forming a sort of coating, which might perhaps be compared to the glaze which is baked upon porcelain.—Painting and Decoration.
