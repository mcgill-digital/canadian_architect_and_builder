THE new chapel for the <building>Quebec Seminary </building>(R. C.) is now fairly under way (to replace the chapel lately destroyed by fire). Including the Sanctuary, it will measure 110 feet in length, with a width aver all of 62 feet exclusive of side chapels, of which there will be five on each side, having semi-circular ends to receive the altars. The walls are to be built of hammer dressed stone with fine cut jambs, string courses, etc. The basement is to be vaulted, upon which the tile flooring of the chapel will be laid. When fully completed, the cost will be about $35.000. The contractor is Mr. <person>Thomas Pampalon, </person>the architect Mr. <person>J. F. Peachy</person>.

A new frame building now approaching completion for the <firm>Richelieu Navigation Co</firm>., on their wharf, is also in the-hands of the same architect. It is built entirely of wood, and is of a very neat design. It is intended for ticket offices, stores, etc., and will cost about $3,000. Mr. <person>George Boiteau </person>is the contractor.

The first building on the new line of St. John St. (now being widened), is now being erected for Mr. Dynes. The first story consists of a plate glass front with stone piers, the upper stories forming a dwelling, being built of white brick with stone trimmings. It will cost $6,000. Contractor, <person>A. Cummings</person>; architect, <person>H. Staveley</person>.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



 THE competition plans for the <building>Provincial Government buildings</building>have all  been sent in, and the architects are waiting now to hear the successful

names.



The City council have at last resolved to return all the plans for their proposed new market. This last resolution arrived at by them is very unfair to those professional men whose time and talents have been expended apparently to educate the minds of the Council up to the requirements of their position. To return the immense quantity of work to the authors without any recompense after having culled therefrom all the information required, appears a very unjust and discouraging proceeding. The architects entered into this competition, adhering to the terms thereof as set out by the advertisement, believing of course that the most unusual reservation which the Council thought it wise to insert, of rejecting all the plans, would only be acted upon as a dernier resort, and not to be taken advantage of because they have now determined to build differently from the original idea. The Council have instructed Mr. <person>George Brown </person>to prepare plans for the new market, to cost $16,000

Mr. <person>Foulks</person> is building two more stores on his block on Main street.

The School Board are having the Smead hot air heating and ventilating system put into the schools.

The lookout in the building trade is brighter, and there will no doubt be several buildings go up on Main street this season.



<article title="Correspondence - British Columbia" author="">BRITISH COLUMBIA.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)

HERE are many fine buildings even in the youthful city of Vancouver,  of which any city in Canada would be proud. The <building>C. P. R. Hotel </building>is a magnificent brick structure. The New York block, in which Sir <person>George Stephen </person>is interested, the Van Horne block, the Lord Elplinstone block, and several others on Grenville street, are three and four story brick buildings heavily faced with grey granite. Sir <person>Donald Smith </person>has one under way which will eclipse anything on the coast, while the Ferguson block on the corner of Hastings and Richmond streets is a noble edifice. There are a number of fine buildings and business blocks already on the way, and when to these are added the New Government buildings, Dominion and Provincial, the <building>C. P. R. opera house</building>, the new <building>Bank of British Columbia </building>and Bank of Montreal blocks, now under contemplation, Vancouver will have, in proportion to its population, more fine buildings than any city in the Dominion. Up to last Christmas the total value of buildings erected was $2,000,000. The number of buildings erected last year was about 400 and their value about $1,000,000. A very great increase has occurred since, and at the present time the building boom is just starting for the season, although it has continued more or less all winter, if one flurry of snow and a few nights of frost may be called winter. However, before touching upon some of these in a more detailed way, I should like in my next to give a chapter on the sewerage and water works systems, which will be found, I trust, most interesting.

It must be borne in mind that the enterprise of building a city such as Vancouver is at the present time, was incomparably greater, situated as

was, than if its site were in a prairie or in open, clear country. Where it now stands, three years ago was a dense forest of giant trees, which to cut down, clear away and stump, was a gigantic task. Their enormous roots extend in every direction, and will neither pull out nor rot. Every stump has to be dynamited at great expense and at much risk of life, costing $500 per acre to do it. When I tell you that 1,000 acres of this land have been cleared, and put into lots, that 40 miles of street, have been graded, that 6 miles have been planked, that 47 miles of sidewalk have been laid down, that nine miles of park road have been made and most of it gravelled, that it-cost the citizens $60,000 to erect bridges, and that in the aggregate something like $300,000 has been expended in public improvements, including fire halls and fire engines, etc., city hail, market site, public schools, sewer.

age, and recreation grounds, readers will best appreciate the energy and enterprise that gave to it its being,

Nor is Vancouver the only city in British Columbia. Its older sisters, Victoria, Nanaimo and New Westminster are coming on apace and also showing wonderful development, each of which contains features of special interest in the lines on which the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is conducted. Not only are these progressive, but all British Columbia, for many years in the Slough of Despond. Its architects and builders are the sons of England, Ireland and Scotland and of the Eastern Provinces, and no nation on earth can boast of better workmen.



<article title="Correspondence - Ottawa" author="">OTTAWA. 

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)

BUILDING	operations are well under way, a large number of buildings commenced, principally dwellings. Very few business blocks

and public buildings are as yet spoken of. It may fairly be estimated that the amount to be expended this season will fall far short of last year. The principal work let out by the different architects since last report is: <person>F. J. Alexander</person>, architect, residence for Rev. Mr. Moore, $5,000; residence for Mr. Wild, $6,000. <person>J. R. Bowes</person>, architect, residence for<person> 0. R. Smith</person>, $4,500; improvements to <building>By Ward market building </building>$3,500; fitting for new <building>police station, Ottawa</building>, $1,200; store for <person>R. Sholdis </person>$4,500; store for <person>R. Steckel, </person>$3,000; warehouse for <person>J. Martin, </person>$4,200; Buckingham public school, $3,-

000. <person>G. F. Stalker</person>, architect, residence for <person>J. Gibson</person>, $3,400. The architects report plenty of work in the offices, but not ready to let out. A large number of small dwellings are under way on which architects are not employed, and as no account of them is kept in the city hall, it is impossible to give a report of them.

The <assoc>Ottawa Institute of Architects </assoc>seem to be pleased with the result of the late convention of architects in Toronto, and individually they hope for a Provincial charter at the next session of the Ontario Legislature.

The contractors here have done nothing yet towards forming a contractor's union, although individually they all favor the scheme, but no one seems inclined to take the initiative. I have no doubt you will be able to bring about a Provincial Association of contractors as you have done with the Architects' Association.

The Architect's Institute have now a room leased for holding their meetings which is open at all times to the members of the Institute. I understand from members that there are a few members of the profession practising in the city who have not yet joined, but it is expected they will join before the Ontario Association is chartered. The Ottawa Institue feel highly honored in having one of their members vice-president of the Ontario Association.

The new Departmental buildings erected by the Government will be ready for occupation on the 1st May, and judging from remarks recently made by the Minister of Public Works in the House of Commons, they will cost when completed close on one million dollars.



<article title="Correspondence - An Association of Ontario Builders and Contractors" author="">AN ASSOCIATION OF ONTARIO BUILDERS AND CONTORS.

TRENTON, May 10th, 1889.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR Sir,â€”Regarding the formation of a <assoc>Provincial Association of Contractors and Builders</assoc>, I desire to say that I am heartily in accord with the movement, and hope it may be the means of doing much good, as I am fully satisfied there is much room for improvement in the present condition of affairs. I don't complain of the short step between journeyman and contractor referred to by one of your esteemed correspondents, but I do complain of the competition of those who never were good journeymen, who don't know what a good job is like, and in consequence of whose operations the trade in many branches of building is becoming so demoralized that it is next to impossible for a builder of any taste and ability as a mechanic, to live and pay 100 cents in the $, especially in our smaller towns. Another great evil that I see is the attempt to do without the services of the competent architect in supervising the work of construction, We are called upon to figure on the cost of buildings according to certain plans and specifications, and sometimes are disappointed on being told, after putting in as reasonable an offer as we possibly could that our tender is far too high. On, seeing the proposed building erected, however, one is inclined to suppose that the fine specification must surely have evaporated long before the first cobble stone of the miserable pile now before us had been thrown into the trench and called a foundation.

Now, sir, if the Association could in any way cope with such evils as these, it would not only benefit those engaged in the business, but also the public. There are also many other existing evils which in my opinion, such an Association might help to remedy, besides forwarding the interests of the trade generally; but having trespassed already too much on your valuable space, I must leave the matter to be developed by abler men than myself. Promising to assist as far as my ability will warrant, I remain,

Yours truly,

ONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE A GOOD BUILDER.





Messrs. <firm>Aikenhead & Crombie</firm>, of Toronto, have secured the contract to supply all the hardware required for the new <building>Toronto Board of Trade Building</building>. The contract price is understood to be in the neighborhood of 6,000, making the largest single order ever supplied by a Canadian dealer.
