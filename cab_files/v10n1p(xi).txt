<firm>THE ONTARIO RADIATOR COMPANY</firm>.

APPLICATION has been made to the Ontario Legislature for the incorporation of the Ontario Radiator Co., Ltd., with a capital stock of $300,000. The first directors of the company are to be Messrs. <person>Thos. Kinnear,</person> <person>W. A. Mitchell</person>, <person>Samuel Crane</person>, <person>J. T. Jackson</person>, <person>J. A. Keyes </person>and <person>F. J. Travers</person>, of Toronto, and <person>Samuel Jackson</person>, of St. Catharines. The purpose for which incorporation is sought is to manufacture a patent radiator, the invention of Messrs. <person>J. T. Jackson</person>, of Toronto, and Samuel Jackson, of St. Catharines. The inventors claim that a fault with radiators as at present constructed is that the steam or hot water often lies dead or stagnant within the radiator loops, which are blind ends, and which, consequently, prevent a free circulation of the steam through them. A great difficulty is to get rid of the air in these

loops. The presence of the air in the loops prevents the steam circulating, and causes half of the radiator to remain cold and unaffected by the ingress of live steam The Jackson radiator has no blind ends in the loops. The steam goes up one side of the loop and down the other side. Then it passes on to the next loop, and repeats the same operation. "'he radiator is in effect a continuous pipe. The principle underlying its construction is exactly the same as that of a coil or straight pipe, all the air in which is driven Out by the steam as it enters, and continues along the pipe. A test of the radiator was recently made at the Polson Engine Works, Toronto, before a number of interested persons, including several architects, and is said to have been very satisfactory. A patent has been obtained for Canada, and applications for Great Britain, France, Germany and the United States arc tinder way.
