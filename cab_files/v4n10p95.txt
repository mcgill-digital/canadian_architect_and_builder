in the by-law under which <person>Mr. Jennings </person>assumed office, delegated to him the authority to control the salaries of the officials of his department. By-law No. 2534 fixing the duties and powers of the engineer provides that he shall have power to appoint such officers and clerks as he may from time to time consider necessary fur the proper and efficient working of his department and that he shall have power to suspend, dismiss and reinstate any officer, servant and employé of his department, and from time to time to prescribe their respective duties in lieu of or in addition to any duties prescribed by any statute or by-law. Sub-section of the 26th clause gives him power " to appoint such foremen and inspectors and employ such laborers as in his opinion may be necessary To efficiently carry out any work under his control ; and all such inspectors and foremen shall be paid such wages as shall be determined upon by him, subject to the approval (if the Committee on Works." This clause is the only one in the by-law which gives the engineer authority to determine the salaries of his assistants, and this authority applies only to inspectors and foremen, and is to he exercised subject to the approval of the Committee on Works. Mr. Jennings seems therefore to have proceeded on a false assumption in claiming that the right to control salaries was conferred upon him at his appointment. On the other hand, the fact that the by-law does not confer upon him this authority, rendered unnecessary the passing by the Council of the amending by-law. It is unfortunate that Mr. Jennings should have written the letter he did to the Council, as it served to accentuate the difficulty. Had a friendly conference taken the place of that letter, no doubt the matter could have been satisfactorily adjusted. As it was, arrangements were proceeding satisfactorily for an amicable settlement when the Board of Trade held an indignation meeting on Mr. Jennings behalf, which could have had no other effect than to confirm the attitude of those who had placed themselves in opposition to the stand which that gentleman had taken. One of the aldermen, who was also a member of the Board of Trade, was refused a courteous hearing when he essayed to make an explanation at that meeting of his course of action in the Council. In the light of these circumstances it cannot be surprising that the Council should have resented the action of the Board of Trade by voting down all proposals for a reconsideration of the matter. There was force in the remark of one of the aldermen, that while the members of the Board of Trade decline to serve the city in the capacity of aldermen, they have shown their willingness to dictate what the conduct should he of those whom the citizens elected to represent them. if the Board is not prepared to do more than find fault, it will best serve the public interest by confining its attention solely to commercial affairs The important duty now devolves upon the Council of appointing a successor to Mr. Jennings. Matters of great moment require attention, and forbid that the appointment should be delayed longer than is absolutely necessary. On the other hand, the very importance of the matters to be entrusted to his hands demands that the person to be appointed should be possessed of the character, education and experience which are necessary to enable him to exercise wise administration. Prior to entering upon office, a clear and definite understanding should be arrived at touching his duties, authority and relations to the Council, such as will prevent the recurrence of misunderstandings like the present one.



<article title=" TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB " author=""><assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.

ON Monday evening, October 5th, was held the annual meeting of this club in its new rooms, for. Yonge and Gerrard streets. There was a fairly large attendance and much enthusiasm.

After the minutes of the last annual meeting had been read and confirmed, the treasurer , Mr<person>. A. C. Barrett</person>, presented his report, showing that the columns of the cash book were like two forces in equilibrium---pretty evenly balanced. This is very satisfactory, considering the many expenses the Club has had during the year.

The  retiring President, Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, made a few remarks giving a short description of the work accomplished, and urging the necessity of the members putting forth a renewed energy. He drew attention to the fact that if members expected architects and others to continue preparing for them papers, they must make a point of keeping tip the attendance, as it could not be expected

that busy men would give up valuable time if it were not appreciated.

After several proposed changes in the constitution had been adopted, the nomination and election of officers was proceeded with, the following being elected —President, Mr. <person>J. A. Pearson</person>; Vice-President, <article title="" author=""> Secretary, <person>C. H. Acton</person>-Bond Assistant Secretary, <person>Murray A. White </person>; Treasurer, <person>T. R. Johnson </person>Directors, <person>C. J. Gibson </person>and <person>E. B. Jarvis</person>.

The Club has now very comfortable quarters, which, with a little judicious decorating, will be a credit to so artistic a body. Visitors will at all times be welcome, a hearty invitation being extended to all who are interested in the aims and objects of the Club

<article title=" CHURCH ARCHITECTURE " author="">CHURCH ARCHITECTURE.

MR. <person>JOHN WILLS</person>, F. S. Sc., architect, of  Dei by, Eng., who is a delegate to the Methodist Ecumenical Conference at Washington, D. C., addressed a meeting of Methodist ministers in Toronto recently on the subject of Methodist Church Architecture." He also exhibited a number of his own drawings from which churches have been erected in different parts of England. Mr. Wills recommends that there should be at least four means of egress for all large churches. He thinks the Gothic, properly and carefully adapted to modern forms of worship, the most appropriate style of church architecture. He is of the opinion that the situation of the organ and choir should be either behind the minister or in the same end in one of the transepts. Concerning methods of heating, his preference is for the hot water low pressure system.





PUBLICATIONS.

The <firm>Adamant Manufacturing Co. </firm>Toronto, have issued a neatly printed pamphlet explaining the nature and advantages of their new plastering material.

We are indebted to Mr. <person>William Mueller</person>, bookseller and importer of works of art, 695 Broadway, New York, for a copy of Academy Architecture and Annual Architectural Review,' for 1891, edited by <person>Alex. Koch</person>, architect, and containing a selection of the most prominent architectural drawings hung at the Royal Academy Exhibition, and a review of interest architectural subjects carried out or designed during the last few years in England and abroad.

In the November number, the Cosmopolitan will publish a series of letters written by <person>Gen. W. T. Sherman </person>to one of his young daughters, between the years 1859 and 1865 and covering most of the events of the war of succession. These letters present graphic pictures of a great soldier amid some of the stirring scenes in which he was a giant figure, and in them the patriotic spirit of the Federal general is seen to have been most attractively tempered by a strong affection for the Southern people.



PERSONAL.

On behalf of a Canadian syndicate invited by the government of Russia to tender for the construction of the eastern part of the Siberian railway, Mr. <person>Geo. A. Keefer</person>, the well known civil engineer of Ottawa, lately set out for the land of Russian exile, Mr. Keefers experience in connection with the construction of the C.P.R. through the Rocky Mountains, well qualifies him to serve the interests of his present employers.
