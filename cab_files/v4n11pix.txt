Sea, the Caspian Sea, the Persian Gulf and the Dead Sea, four great empires succeed one to the other. There was the Chaldean, 13. C. 2,300 to B. C. 1,600 swallowed up by the Egyptians then the rise of the Assyrian empire, about 13. C. 1,320, side by side with Egypt and the land of the Hittites, until its subjugation by the Egyptians in B. C. 625. Twenty years later the empire of the Babylonians sprang into existence, to be in its turn subdued by the all-conquering Persians, who, subduing the Babylonians and Egyptians. extended their empire from the centre of India in the east to the shores of Greece in the west.

	But besides these	great empires,	there was the country of

	of Phoenicia on the border		of	Palestine with the powerful republics

	of Tyre and Sidon		Of the	earlier history of these singular

	people little	known	prior to	B. C. 1,046, but discoveries have

	proved that they	  were an	enterprising	people, having colonies in

	Spain, Italy,	 Greece,	 Minor, the islands of the Mediterranean-

	and	North Africa,	before	the year 1,000 B. C. Phoenicia

flourished from 0 B C when Tyre is believed to have been built, to 860 B. C., when the celebrated Elissa or Dido, together with all the aristocracy of the country, emigrated to Carthage, already a colony of Phoenica, and there founded her celebrated empire. The Phoenicians were the sailors of the ancient world each nation in turn hired the Phoenician ships and sailors for its maritime expeditions.

The kingdom of <person>David</person> and <person>Solomon </person>must not be forgotten

its position was clearly to. be seen on the map. Another important empire was that occupying the western part of Asia Minor

—that of the Syrians from which neighborhood came the early Greeks. Then came the history of the republics of Athens and Sparta, with their colonies in the Mediterranean islands, followed by the career of the youthful conqueror Alexander the Great, King of Macedonian, who extended his kingdom into an empire reaching from Macedonian and Greece on the west to India on the east.

The history in connection with the subject closes with the Romans, who overran all previous countries.

An important fact in this early history was, that everywhere Greek soldiers took part in the wars that were being waged by one ruler against another. As the ships of Phoenicia were hired for transport, so the Greek mercenaries were h red to fight.

Thus by this outline of history it will be seen how intimately connected were all these ancient nations one with another. There was no such thing as isolation ; each nation and people was well known to every other so that it is impossible to reject this and the further confirmatory evidence in the details of architecture in an inquiry as to whence the Greeks got their first notions of art. Of their details, more will be said later.

Another matter to be borne in mind, was that of the materials to be found for building in the countries occupied by the nations mentioned. In Egypt stone was used, but this country really does not, in this particular, help the investigation, because the stone used was not local but brought chiefly from 500 miles up the country. In the land of the Chaldeans, Assyrians and Babylonians was loamy clay in Persia was stone, in the land of the Medes, the ancestors of the Persians was wood.

Material exerted a strong influence on the art. Persian and Lydians, or early Greek architecture, was executed in stone, but in the principles of wooden construction, while the architecture of the Chaldeans, Assyrians and Babylonians was of brick.

The lecturer then proceeded to describe the forms of Greek temples and the details of the orders, and went on to show by means of his crayon sketches of caps from Egypt and Phoenicia, the origin of the Doric, tonic and Corinthian details.

From temples at Mediuct Habon and Bern Hassan in Egypt were obtained the rough forms of the Doric; Phoenicia at Kitron furnished examples of Ionic scrolls as decorative features for capitals, while in Egypt at Philae, were found caps of decidedly Corinthian outline---all of which were designed and executed long before the Roman occupation of these countries.

The Corinthian order was not, properly speaking, a Greek order ; it was the Romans who fully developed it. The lecturer produced a number of beautiful illustrations of the Roman order

as exemplified by buildings principally in the north of Africa, Algiers and Tunis, and explained how in the Roman order the column as a structural feature sunk into a decorative adjunct, while the arch came into prominence constructurally.



In concluding, the lecturer said he had to thank his audience very much for the attentive manner in which each member had listened to him during the whole three-quarters of an hour he had been speaking

In the course of the discussion which followed it was slated, that a belief existed that the " Tuscan order "—which the lecturer had included as an early form of Grecian Doric, which was misnamed Tuscan "just as " Corinthian was misnamed--had an independent origin, and was not derived from any source, as the lecturer showed the others were. In answer to this he remarked that though he had not alluded to Tuscany individually, he had shown how Italy (or Etruria) was an early colony of the Phoenicians, and was no more isolated than was Greece or Persia, and he did not believe in any theory of independent origin or spontaneous invention, but held that there was a system of development in the art which overran all these countries, outside of which it was impossible to seek for origins. As a matter of fact, Etruria was peopled from Asia Minor in the twelfth century

B. C., prior to the arrival of the Phoenicians, which adds proof to the development of the art of architecture 

A very hearty vote of thanks was passed, and in answer to the chairman the lecturer said he would be happy to give map and sketches to the Club if they would be of use.

THE designs received in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER competition for a suburban residence have been forwarded to Ottawa. We hope to publish the judge's reply thereupon in our December issue. 



PASSING EVENTS.

The smoking " concerts with which the regular meeting of the <assoc>Montreal

Underwriters' Association </assoc>were inaugurated recently, strike me as being somewhat incongruous with its objects, which are popularly supposed to be the prevention of smoking, and the pocketing of premiums.



<building>The new Bank of Hamilton </building>in course of erection at the corner of King and James streets, Hamilton, will cost the architect little for draughtsmanship, as it is simply an abbreviated copy of the <building>Bank of Commerce at Toronto</building> It may be added that the process of abbreviation has not enhanced the merits of the original design.



Municipal authority was enforced in an unusual and ludicrous manner at the town of Niagara Falls, the other day. <firm>The Michigan Central Railroad </firm>officials resisted the attempt of the town to lay water mains under the tracks. The mayor, constables and fire brigade turned out and put the enemy to flight by turning on them the hose.



A dispatch from Ottawa announces that <person>Mr. Perley</person>, late chief engineer of the Department of Public Works is sinking to his death. The news brings to me, as to many others, a ceiling of sorrow. The keen suffering which the exposure of his one mis-step has brought upon the aged man who for many years gave valuable service to this country, proves beyond question his unfitness to be classed with the professional boodlers whose habitual crooked practices have recently been dragged into the light of public condemnation

The college students of Toronto look a new departure this year from the established custom of doing mischief for mischief's sake on Halloween, by pulling down the unsightly fence surrounding the Normal School grounds. For several years the citizens and the press had urged the government to replace the eyesore with something of a more pleasing character, but their entreaties went for naught. The students accomplished the desired result in a few minutes But for the knowledge that the artistic instinct exists but feebly in the management of the provincial art schools, I would be astonished that they would live so contentedly amid such surroundings." Let us hope that the removal of the mass of ugliness upon which their eyes

so long rested, will result in quickening their artistic perceptions, and secure improvement in the ideals placed before their pupils.
