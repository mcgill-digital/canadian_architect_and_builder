<doctype type="text;ad">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



LEGAL.

In reply to a correspondent the American Architect states that unless an architect copyrights his designs, the law will not prevent the client for whom they were prepared and who has paid for them, from giving copies of them to his friends. The general tendency of judicial decisions in the United States courts is said have been against the establishment of implied copyrights of any kind.

GLASS

WINDOWS

THAT ARE

FIRE-PROOF

These windows in a fire-proof building, complete the security, and in any building will thoroughly prevent the spread and advancement of the fiercest flames.



Better than iron shutters (even if they happened to be closed at the needed time) ; fireproof glass remains intact, resisting both the intense heat of the fire and the action of water.

Many practical tests have proved it's efficiency.

Used in conjunction with our hollow sheet-metal frames and other fire-proof fittings, it gives the most perfect protection available.

It's adoption lessens insurance rates.
