<article title="Sewage Disposal in Toronto" author="">Sewage Disposal in Toronto.	The Toronto City Council have shown good sense by throwing

		out the recommendation of the



Board of Control that the citizens should be asked to express by ballot their approval or disapproval of the proposal to install the septic tank system for the disposal of sewage. The City Engineer was sent to England last year to investigate sewage disposal methods. He has presented his report. If the Council have confidence in him they should act on his recommendations. if they have not full confidence in his judgment on this particular matter, let them appoint an expert to advise and act with him. What can the average citizen be expected to know about the merits or demerits of particular methods of sewage disposal for a large city? Let the Council and their officials deal with the problem and assume full responsibility for the resulting success or failure.



The offer of $350,000 to Toronto

<article title="A Carnegie Library for Toronto" author="">A Carnegie Library for Toronto.  with which to build a Public

<person>Andrew Carnegie</person>

Library has brought on an acute attack of public debating upon the subject of <person>Mr. Carnegie</person>'s grants. We can sympathize with the point of view of every one without seeing that it becomes the duty of the City Council to attitudinize in support of it or of any view but its own or what should be its own— whether or not it is for the interest of the citizens, as regards the question of having and maintaining a public library, to accept this grant and its conditions. Col.

Denison may object to the intrusion of Americano Scotchmen in the affairs of Canada ; there is something noble and inspiring about this gentleman's stout Canadianism. Mr. <person>E. R. Osler </person>may consider Mr. Carnegie's offer impertinent; we are glad to have Mr. Osler take this stand, for it is certainly pertinent that the exceptionally wealthy should begin in Toronto that practice of endowing public institutions which is doing so much good in the cities of the United States ; and Mr. Osler, who is liberal himself, is just the man to introduce into wealthy circles in Toronto the idea that one of the privileges of wealth is the endowment of beneficent and educational institutions. The Toronto District Labour Council may "protest against the acceptance of any alms or contribution . as an easement to the conscience of this man . . who imported into the Town of Homestead a gang of sluggers, known as United States deputy marshals, whose presence resulted in the loss of life of our brother workers"—who were out on strike in July, 1892. This too is an interesting demonstration, marking the progress of thought in these matters ; but it is not the function of the City Council to discuss Mr. Carnegie's wealth, only the portion of it which he offers for their use :—whether it is enough for the purpose and whether the accompanying obligation is too great to undertake as a consequence of acceptance.



The interesting questions really are whether the money—from which a large subtraction must be made
