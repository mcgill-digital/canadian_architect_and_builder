CLOSE OF VOLUME IV.

 THE present number completes the fourth volume of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER A comprehensive index to this volume is presented herewith. As a result of continued effort and the generous support which we have received, we ale enabled to look back upon a year of progress. Satisfactory increase is shown in the number of subscribers and advertisers. in return for which, we have sought to add to the value of the



paper. Nowhere will we find information of equal quantity and value supplied for so small a price. Our policy in the future, as in the past, will be to endeavor to increase the value of the monthly and weekly issues to the fullest degree warranted by the measure of support accorded us. To every reader we extend the wish for a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year, and to those who have assisted in any way to advance the interests of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, may 1892 bring added prosperity.



WE regret to learn that our esteemed contemporary, the American Architect, has recently suffered considerable loss and inconvenience in consequence of the building in which are its offices having been partially destroyed by fire.



The publication of <person>Mr. Doran</person>'s paper on " Building Inspection," read at the last meeting of the architects and students of Montreal, together with several other articles intended to appear in this number, is unavoidably preferred owing to unexpected demands upon our space.



THE sketch which we present of <person>Mr. Chas. Baillairgé</person>, City Engineer, of Quebec, outlines the record of an unusually busy and useful life. Conjoined with a brilliant mind, Mr. Baillargé is the possessor of a lightsome disposition, and the physical ability

to work eighteen hours a day. To this fortunate Circumstance is no \ largely due the extent and value of his accomplishments and the fact that at the age of sixty—five, a  further period of usefulness appears yet to lie before him. That such may he the case, is the wish of his many friends.



THE near approach of the municipal elections is being taken advantage of by the <assoc>Toronto Trades and Labor Council </assoc>to urge upon the city Council the passing of a bylaw for the inspection of scaffolds. A committee consisting of three members of the Trades and Labor Council, three members of the <building>Builders Association </building>and the City Commissioner, has been appointed into draft a by-law and report. Such a by-law as the one proposed is not likely to prove satisfactory to anyone except those who may succeed in getting appointments as

inspectors. Builders will have the right to insist that when the by-law comes into operation their liability for accidents on (" inspected') scaffolds shall be transferred to the city.



THE Toronto plumbing by-law' makes it compulsory that the drainage in all new buildings shall undergo proper inspection. The ordinance is a wise one, and is, we trust, faithfully administered. There is reason to regret that it was not enacted at a much earlier period in the city's history. The character of much of the work clone prior to the existence of the present law, is of the worst description The outbreak of disease has led in recent Instances to an examination of some of these uninspected drains, disclosing the fact that they were laid in the most careless and criminal manner, without the use of an ounce of cement. It is safe to assert that many a life has been sacrificed to this willful neglect, :and as the provisions of the present law are not retrotractive the injury will continue.
