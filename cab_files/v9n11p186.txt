yet been decided beyond a peradventure what mode of heating is the most economical, it has become a fixed fact in the minds of many who have investigated the various methods, that steam heating, if the appliances are modern and fitted up with modern attachments, is by far the easiest to handle, and the desired results are more direct and rapid than the like results of any other method. Notwithstanding the fact that heating by steam is the proper thing to introduce into large buildings, we do not approve of it for use in private dwellings or cottages, unless, of course, the buildings are large and contain a great many rooms and halls. For the smaller buildings a hot water system is by far the best, and country builders, when asked by their em-plovers -as they often are- what system of heating is best to adopt for warming the building they are about to erect, should advise accordingly. If the building is of moderate size and does not contain more than 16 or 20 rooms, including halls, advise hot water. If there are more than twenty and the rooms are large, then advise steam by all means. Of course, there will be other things to consider. A hot water furnace must have a place under the main floor in order that the cooled water may return to the boiler by gravitation ; so also must a steam heater, for it must be remembered that the water level in the boiler must be below the lowest point of the lowest radiator. As a rule, it costs a little more to put in a hot water system than to put in steam, but when once in, and in good working order, and properly protected, it is the best device in existence for warming Canadian homes of moderate dimensions. In small houses, where the expense of a hot water system would be too great, a hot air or combination furnace will be found to he a great improvement over stoves.

PRODUCTION OF BUILDING MATERIALS.

THE fifth annual report of Mr. Archibald Blue, Director of the Ontario Bureau of Mines, which covers the year 1895, furnishes some interesting, although not altogether encouraging statistics relative to the production of building materials within the last five years. The depression in building according to the statistics, seems not to have affected the production of materials until last year, when in nearly every line there was a marked decrease in the quantity manufactured. This is accounted for, no doubt, by the fact that much of the products of the former years remained unutilized, and manufacturers were averse to accumulating further supplies. The following table gives the value of building stone, rubble and other products of the quarry for the five years, together with the amount of wages paid for labor; and shows a steady decline since 1891. For each of the last two years the value is only about one-half of the value for that year

	Year.	Value.	Wages.

	1891	$1,000,000	$520,000

	1892	88o,ooo	730,000

	1893	721,000	464,000

	1894	554,370	336,000

	1895	438,000	296,000









The production of common brick was greater in 1892 than in the previous year, but since that time has become less each year. The returns indicate that many of the brick yards have not been in operation. The

quantity of drain tile manufactured increased from 7,500,000 in 1891 to 25,000,000 in 1894, but dropped to



14,000,000 in 1895, which amount, however, was nearly double the output of 1891. Great quantities of tile are now being used by farmers in an effort to improve their farms and to meet the competition so keenly felt. The production of common brick and tile from 1891 to 1895 was as follows:

With respect to pressed brick, roofing tile and terra cotta, the largest production was in the year 1894, when it amounted in value to $286,230. For the past four years the quantity shows no great variation, and would seem to indicate two facts, viz., that pressed brick is meeting with more general favor, and that the United States product is likely to be entirely shut out of the Canadian market. The first pressed brick was made in Ontario eight or ten years ago. Below are the statistics for pressed brick, roofing tile, and terra cotta:

Greater development has taken place in the cement industry than in any other line connected with the building materials, yet the quantity of Portland manufactured is less than one-half that which is imported. The production of natural cement, as the accompanying table shows, has remained nearly stationary since 1891, but the quantity of Portland has been nearly doubled. The demand for that variety for street construction, as well as for Government works, has no doubt encouraged this industry at home.
