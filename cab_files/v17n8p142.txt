file cost of stock bricks delivered on a London site averaged about 2oS. per thousand in 1776, 42s. in 1811, and at the present time may be taken at 40S. per thousand. Bricklayers' wages have gradually increased from approximately 3d. per hour in 1776 to 10½d. per hour at the present lime ; whilst the cost of ordinary stock brickwork in mortar has varied from £8 per rod in 1776 to £17 per rod in 1904.

Experiments were recently made in England to determine the relative strength of hand-made brick and machine-made brick, with the following results The machine brick were dried in a drier and kiln burned, and had an ultimate strength of 197.7 tons per square foot. The hand-made brick had an ultimate strength of 125.9 tons per square foot. At those weights they were crushed. The machine-made brick showed an absorption of 7.83 per cent.
