THE <assoc>Master Plumbers' Association of Toronto </assoc>have petitioned the City Council to amend in several important particulars the plumbing by-law of the city. They ask that the license fee bc reduced from $10 to $1 per year that a qualifying examination must be passed by every person to whom a license is granted that a permit to construct or reconstruct the drainage system of any building shall issue to thc master plumber only. The City Engineer recommends the Council to refuse to reduce the license fee, to grant the petition for a qualifying examination and in lieu of granting an exclusive permit to the plumber, to so amend the by-law as to prohibit the laying of tile drains under dwellings, and to substitute therefor iron pipes, to be put in and connected with the drains outside the house by the licensed plumbers only, which would enable the plumber's work to be inspected and a certificate issued independent of the drain layers, which, at present, is one of the difficulties of carrying out the existing plumbing by—law. it is hoped that the Council will see the wisdom of adopting these and other required amendments to the by-law. The master plumbers have suffered the injustice of being compelled to pay a license fee of $10 per year for the  privilege of doing business in competition with carpenters, tinsmiths, and everybody else who might see fit to take out a plumbers license, as the by-law does not provide that applicants for license must undergo examination. The absence of such a provision has thrown a large amount of plumbing work which should properly belong to the qualified master plumber, into the hands of journeymen, apprentices and persons in other lines of business who saw a chance to make a profit above the cost of the license by tacking on plumbing as a side line to their legitimate business. The by-law should fix the lowest limit of weight of iron pipe at 12 or 13 pounds to the foot, as it is frequently the case with cast iron pipe that one side is much thinner than the other, and in pipe weighing but nine pounds to the foot, a very slight indentation is sometimes sufficient to puncture the metal on the thin side while it is with difficulty that joints can be made tight without cracking the pipe. It is the opinion of persons who have followed closely developments in sanitary science that at least in the newer sections of the city, where the sewers are in good condition, the trap and breather which the present by-law specifies shall be attached to the house-drain between thc building and thc sewer should be abolished, and the soil pipes allowed to act as ventilators for the sewers. It is a well-known fact that for two or three months during a severe winter, such as we have just passed through, the street gratings, which are designed to act as ventilators for the sewers, become choked with snow and ice, and sewers and drains leading therefrom are charged with foul gases which, were iron drains employed, and outside traps and breathers omitted, would be carried through the house-drains and discharged into the atmosphere above the roof. In recent amendments to the New York plumbing regulations, the use of the outside trap and breather is made optional, and in practice their employment is said to be declining.
