To RESTORE FADED MARBLES.—The lost colours of marbles may often he quite restored by washing with the strongest soap lees combined with quick-lime, about the consistency of good milk. This composition should be laid on the surface for a day and night. Finally remove it with soap anti water, and the marble should be found as beautiful as ever.
