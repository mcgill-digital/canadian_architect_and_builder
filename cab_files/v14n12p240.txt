It is suggested in Nat tire that great advantage would accrue from the use of magnetic iron ore as a material for the manufacture of concrete blocks. If magnetite is used instead of ordinary rock broken into fragments and magnetic sand or ilmenite sand instead of ordinary sea sand, concrete blocks can be obtained which have all the strength of the ordinary concrete blocks, and which weigh, when immersed in water, twice as much as the ordinary blocks. The great advantage of this additional weight as regards resistance to the waves is obvious.

THE	DELIGHT OF THE DECORATOR

Being remarkably pale in color, it is adapted for fine interiors.





It has a beautiful lustre, and when rubbed makes an exceedingly fine finish.
