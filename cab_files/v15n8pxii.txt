It is quite natural that the <assoc>Canadian Manufacturers' Association </assoc>should he interested in trying to secure proper technical instruction for the artizan classes in this country. In reports on this subject presented to the Association recently, the <building>Toronto Technical School </building>as recently reorganized is declared to be on a satisfactory basis to impart the needed instruction, if supplied with adequate funds. The Board of Control of the City Council is censured for having reduced by $2000 the yearly appropriation for the school, thereby crippling its usefulness.

The council of arts and manufactures of the province of Quebec is commended for the work it is doing in Montreal, but the fact is emphasized that it also is hampered in its operation by lack of funds and the need of a suitable building. Comparison is made with a Philadelphia institution doing work of similar character, in which the annual outlay per pupil is $68.66, as against $2.55 per pupil in Montreal



Fireproof floor are most desirable. They may be made of concrete or brick arches between iron girders, in which case there is no space between the flooring of one room and the ceiling of the room below When timber is used it should bc dry and well seasoned with sound boarding, to ensure separation between the rooms and to prevent either water leaking from the floor to thc ceiling below or air passing from the room below to the above. Good flooring evidently serves to protect the ceilings of the rooms below. When there is space between the flooring and the ceiling and still more especially where a wooden flooring is placed over a concrete or other foundation laid on the ground, it is necessary to provide for ventilation of the space below the flooring. This is usually done by placing a perforated iron grating, instead of a brick, here and there in the outer walls, so that air can pass freely in or out below the floors. For this purpose bricks with conical holes through them would no doubt be found very useful.
