CANADA is usually credited with holding the most advanced position among the colonies of Great Britain. In the matter of associations for the advancement of the interests of builders and contractors, however, we must take second place to Australia and even Tasmania, where organizations of this character are fulfilling a itself purpose.



 OUTSIDERS will be apt to think that building enterprises on an extensive scale are known in Hamilton, when they see

paragraphs in the daily diapers of that city referring to the issuing of prints for improvements costing less than $2,000, leaded " Signs of the Building Boom." Straws may show which way the wind is blowing, but to predicate a building boom till which slight evidence, denotes extraordinary sanguinity, OF an imperfect conception of tile meaning of the term.





A VERY practical suggestion for the preservation of the true alignment of some stones comes from Holland. It consists In the cutting of a hollow in the end of one stone and the working of a corresponding projection on the next. In our climate, where king frost plays such havoc with the toads and pavetilellls, this method will prevent much of the unsightly regularity inevitable to the usual manner of setting curb stones, still I he extra cost would be offset by the greater length of time which would (lapse before they would require It) lie re—Sel.



It is no uncommon thing 10 observe in the very court of our Canadian cities large areas of vacant land owner by religious corporations tins, on which no taxes are levied. These lands, while standing its a bar to progress ate nevertheless greatly enhanced in value by surrounding improvements carried by other private enterprise. In this way the owners grow rich at the expense of their neighbors who assist pt ogress and pay the taxes. Whether or not churches still be taxed, its sonic contend, it seems but right that the law should be attended to the extent necessary to remedy this justice which is being Perlietnated under its l)resent provisions.

<building> THE Architectural Sketch Club </building>filled up the little room



allotted to them at the <assoc>Ontario Society of Aliases </assoc>Exhibit and with a very interesting series of sketches, many of which were the results of their last season's studies and competitions. The ptogtess of the Club is very noticeable, and the rendering of many of tlie drawings showed decide-is artistic ability. We were sorry- to notice the tendency 10 use their room its a store room, giving it an unused appearance, uninviting and somewhat for- a -



born. It is difficult enough to get the general public to take at the Interest in architectural drawing, without the bar of an unattractive room.





THE 'lot-onto Mill recently contained an editorial on die question of the payment of the clerk of the works of the <building>new City Hall at Toronto</building>, which is entirely to the point and should be read by all laymen, and especially by the members of city councils and other public broils. The attempt of some of the aldermen to sole upon the architectural half the expense of he clerk if works is preposterous, and is a cheese-paring policy

	which	can only be		detrimental is the work		from every point of

 view.		As well	might	City	Engineer	<person>Jennings</person> be asked pay
