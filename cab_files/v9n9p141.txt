with a dry sand core, by the Cornell Iron Works, New York.

The weather was clear and warm, with a slight breeze from south-west. Temperature of air, 75 Fahr.

Strength by Gordon's Formula was as follows

	Preaking strength	902,000 pounds

	Safe load 1-5 X 902,000	180,400 pounds, 90.2 tons.



The result of Test No. 3 is shown in photographs (Figs. 10 and 11).

COLUM N.



July 6, 1896.

The Column was a cast-iron, hollow, round column, with flanges faced on both ends, and was uncovered. It was cast horizontally with a dry sand core, by the Cornell Iron Works, New York The column was the same as illustrated in diagram (Fig. 9), with the following exceptions Length, over-all, 13 feet O1/4 inch; thickness of flanges, I 5/8 inches ; flanges reinforced by four ribs, each 7/8 inch thick, reaching from outer end of flange to cylinder at an angle of about 45.

The result of the test is shown in photographs (Figs. 12 and 13). The fracture occurred at about the centre of the column where the deflection was the greatest. There was a crack about five inches long about seven inches above the fracture on the convex side of the column, showing that the column first pulled apart on the outside of the bend. No water was thrown on this column during the test.

SAME AS TESTS NO. I, 2, 3 AND 4. CAST-IRON COLUMN.



July 10, 1896.



The column was a cast-iron, hollow, round column, with flanges faced on both ends, and was uncovered. It was cast horizontally with a dry sand core by the Cornell Iron Works, New York. The column was the same as illustrated in photograph (Fig. 9), with the following exceptions Flanges were 1 5/8 inches thick, and were reinforced with four ribs as in Test No. 4. There was a slight defect in this casting, there being a porous portion a few inches long on one side about 3 feet 6 inches from the lower end.

The weather was partly cloudy and sultry. There was a strong wind from the south-west. Temperature of the atmosphere was 80 Fahr.

Water was thrown upon the column through about

50 feet of 2 1/2-inch rubber hose and a 3/4-inch nozzle. The pressure at the hydrant was fifty pounds.

The column was very red when the water was thrown on it the last time. The brick walls and arch roof cracked when water fell on them. The column was badly bent, but otherwise appeared uninjured.
