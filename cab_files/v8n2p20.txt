Association examinations, because they do not happen to be of a compulsory character, every student who hopes to succeed in the profession should gladly present himself as a candidate for examination for the sake of the benefit which must accrue to himself from a thorough mastery of the examination subjects. It is to be hoped that the recommendation embodied in <person>Mr. Gordon</person>resolution with regard to the Association Library, may be successfully carried out.

THE monthly dinner and meeting of the Province of <assoc>Quebec Association of Architects </assoc>took place on Tuesday, the 15th January. Mr. A. T. Taylor, F. R. I. B. A., gave a very interesting lecture on "The Three Cathedrals of St. Paul's, London," accompanied by numerous sketches and drawings of the different structures that succeeded one another on the present site of the Cathedral. The present St. Paul's rests on the site previously occupied by two other churches; it is even claimed that on the same site was erected a temple to Diana. Very little is known of the Saxon church, which must have been of a primitive char-

ing of the corner stone. Its dome is reputed the finest and best proportioned in the world.

A discussion took place after the lecture, and a vote of thanks was tendered to the lecturer for his interesting paper, proposed by Mr. <person>J. E. Resther </person>and seconded by Mr. <person>J. Venne</person>.

At the last monthly dinner of the Association held on the 12th instant an interesting lecture was also given by the Secretary, Mr. J. Venne, on "The Interior Management of the Architect's Office," and was discussed amongst others by Messrs. <person>J. Nelson</person>, <person>A. Raza </person>and J. E. Resther.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—Please find enclosed P. 0. order for renewal of my subscription to your journal, which in my opinion is making steady progress and becoming of more value to men in my line of business with each issue. I am much pleased with the current number, but notice several errors in your building notes from this city. Mr. <person>N. Hoffar </person>and not <person>Mr. Fripp </person>was the architect of the court house. Mr. Fripp was the architect of the "Inns of Court," a large office building costing about $30,000, which was built opposite the court house last year. Mr. N.

acter, and built of perishable material as were most of the builddings of that agitated period. The structure that replaced the last named was well worthy of notice; it was in the gothic style and of a typical English character. Its spire was the highest in Europe at the time, and was rich in "souvenirs" and legends, and also contained in itself two parish churches, which had, strange to say, preserved its servitudes and priveleges. At about the period of the Reform it was used successively as a market and exchange and even as a stable. Later on Sir Christopher Wren, the architect of the present St. Paul's, was commissioned to repair the building, and added to its principal facade a porch in the Renaissance style of that period. The great fire of London put a stop to the restoration of the church. Sir Christopher Wren then prepared numerous drawings and schemes for the cathedral destined to replace it, but as often happens, the scheme recommended by the architect was not accepted, and Charles II adopted the plans of what he thought was a more ecclesiastical looking building, but leaving to the architect the liberty of altering and improving the original design. The architect took advantage of this latitude and produced one of the finest monuments in existence. This cathedral is the only building of any magnitude erected under one architect, the cross surmounting the dome having been set in position thirty-five years after the lay-

Hoffar was also the architect of the Home block (stores) $10,000. Another neat building built last year was the <building>Garnbrinus Hotel</building>, Mr. Thos. Hooper, of Victoria, B. C., architect This building was faced with pressed brick ; cost $10,000. "0. Wick" is rather an obscure contraction for <person>C. 0. Wickenden, </person>the name of the architect of the Hudson Bay Co.'s building.

An article on the rights and privileges of owners who wish to build basement buildings adjoining those which have none, would be appreciated here I think. I know of no law (local) governing such cases. This question should include another, that of putting outside footings on foundation walls which extend to the adjoining property. There has been no trouble that I am aware of on these points as yet, though there have been several cases which might have resulted in a law suit. We ourselves have had some narrow escapes. In one case we put a footing out on a lot adjoining the lot on which we built a building having no basement. This footing was about six inches over the line and the whole length of the lot, 120 feet. The owner, as many Vancouver owners do, resides in Europe I think. If you can give us some information about the laws and customs regulating these matters I am sure they will be much appreciated.

Yours respectfully,	<person>A. E. CARTER</person>.
