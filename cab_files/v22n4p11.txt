The entrance door is to be flanked by two bronze candelabra, and the front steps will bc of granite. The vestibule and rotunda will be lined with marble and will have marble floors.

Passing through the vestibule, one will enter the rotunda and then the banking room, which is to have a handsome marble tile floor. This will be a long and very high room, the proportions being thirty-four feet wide and seventy-three long by twenty-eight feet in height. It will contain accommodation for sixteen clerks. At the far end of the banking room will be situated the two vaults, one for the treasury and the other for the books.

The manager's room is to be situated between the vestibule and the banking room, and will be fifteen feet by seventeen feet, containing a handsome alcove marked off by two columns, in which there will be located a gas grate. In the rotunda, which one enters from the vestibule, will be an iron and marble winding stairway, leading to the safety deposit vaults in the basement. Reside the stairway will be the elevator, and beyond that a marble stairway leading to the upper stories. The two lower floors will be devoted to banking. On the mezzanine floor 'are to be three offices while on the first floor there will be eleven offices and on the second floor twelve offices. In the upper stories the offices will be rented for general business purposes,

In the basement at the foot of the iron stairway there will be a space, twenty-two by twenty-four feet, in front of the safety deposit vault. The vault will be seventeen feet by twenty-six feet, with the usual coupon rooms to one side. Beyond this there will be the boiler room and the fuel room, also locker rooms and lavatories for the clerks, and a big vault twelve feet by fifteen and a half feet for the use of the bank.

The 01(1 building which now stands on the property was one of the original warehouses in Port Garry It was built of hewn oak logs, and at the time 'the walls of the old fort were destroyed the building was removed to its present location and covered with boards, as it now appears.
