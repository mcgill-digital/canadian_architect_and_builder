FIRE RESISTING STRUCTURES.

THE destruction of the Manhattan Bank building in New York has directed attention to a weakness in the steel skeleton structure, and has shaken faith in the fire resisting qualities of such buildings. A late fire in Chicago, in which two similar buildings were demolished, has further called attention to the matter. It is established that in such buildings, even if the material will not burn, it will warp with the heat to such an extent as to bring them down, and that although the iron work may be covered with a fire resisting material absolute protection is not guaranteed. In the case of the Manhattan bank building it should be stated, however, that the floor beams were not completely covered with the fireâ€”resistant, the lower edge being flush and only protected by the plaster finish. The building was erected

some years ago and previous to the passage of the regulations on this point now in force.

As a result largely of their experience at these two fires, Chiefs Bonner and Sweenie, of the New York and Chicago fire departments, have declared these tall skyscrapers to be huge fire traps, especially when their contents run largely to inflammable materials. They pronounce in favor of buildings of brick and yellow pine. In such the fire burns more slowly, and there is

better chance of saving the contents. The opinions of



such men should carry much weight. It seems probable that the insurance companies will advance the rate on such buildings, in which event the greater premium will be a serious tax on their income and increase the expense of tenants, making that class of building much less desirable as an investment.
