It was moved and seconded that Mr. Geo. F. Durand take the chair.— Carried

On taking his seat as presiding officer of the meeting, Mr. Durand said:

It is quite unnecessary for me to make any remarks in opening this meeting, as you are all well aware what it was called for. I am pleased to see such a large and representative gathering, which is particularly satisfactory as showing that each and all have at heart, the interests of the profession throughout the Province. The first thing I think we have to do is to organize and then we will have to adopt a constitution for our organization. Mr. Burke moved, seconded by Mr. Baltour, ' That the architects present do organize under the name of 'The Ontario Association of Architects.	Carried.

Moved by Mr. W. J. Smith, and seconded by Mr. Charlton, ' That we

do now hand in our names as members of this Association.		This motion

was put and carried. In accordance therewith, the names as previously given were taken by the Secretary and Mr. Balfour.

The draft of constitution was then considered.

SECTION 1.—Name.---' The name of this organization shall be the Ontario Association of Architects." Adopted without amendment.

SECTION IL.—Objects.—The objects of the Association are: To unite in fellowship the architects of the Province of Ontario, to combine their efforts so as to promote the artistic, scientific and practical efficiency of the profession, and to cultivate and encourage the study of kindred arts, and to endeavor to obtain legislation by which a standard of professional knowledge and experience will hereafter be required of all persons practicing the profession."

This section was adopted as it stood, after some discussion by Mr. W. 1. Smith, of Toronto, Mr. Alexander, of Ottawa, and Mr. Curry, of Toronto, as to whether it would not be better to make of the last clause a resolution separate from the constitution.

"SECTION III.— Membership.—The Association shall consist of Fellows and Honorary Members

This clause was taken as objectionable. Mr. Rastrick, of Hamilton, said he considered in starting an organization of this kind, it ought to be made to include as many of the young men in the profession as possible, and he looked upon it as the greatest mistake that could be made to form any cast iron rules in reference to the admission of members. He therefore moved that the words "Fellows and Honorary Members ' be struck out, and the following words substituted therefor: Members, Junior Members, and Honorary Members." No seconder was found for this amendment, and it was therefore not put to the meeting.

In order to avoid any misunderstanding as to there being a number of grades which might arise out of the use of the word ' Fellow, Mr. Watts moved, seconded by Mr. Gordon, "That the word 'Member' be substituted for 'Fellow' throughout the constitution and by-laws of the Association. Carried.

SECTION IV.—Qualifications. —Any architect engaged in the honorable practice of the profession in the Province of Ontario may become a Fellow of this Association. Honorary Members of this Association may be elected upon the recommendation of the Board of Directors, but all Fellows of the Association shall become Honorary Members when, after three years honorable standing as Fellows they resign the practice of architecture. Honorary Members shall not be entitled to vote, nor be eligible to office, nor shall they be assessed for dues or initiation."

Mr. Gordon moved, seconded by Mr. Alexander, that thc above clause be amended to read as follows: Any architect engaged in the honorable practice of the profession in the Province of Ontario, may become a Member of this Association. All Members of the Association may become Honorary Members when, after three years honorable standing as Members, they resign the practice of architecture. Honorary members shall not be entitled to vote, nor be eligible to office, nor shall they be assessed for dues or initiation ' Carried without discussion.

SECTION V.--Officers.--The officers of this Association shall be a President, three Vice-Presidents, a Secretary, a Treasurer and five Directors.

All the officers shall form a Board of Directors for the care of the property and management of the general welfare of the Association, and shall report at each regular meeting.' Carried.

SECTION VI.—President and Vice-President.—It shall be the duty of the President to preside at all meetings of the Association. In his absence the chair shall be taken by the first Vice-President; in the absence of the first Vice-President by the second Vice-President and, in the absence of the second Vice-President, by the third Vice-President."



Mr. Bousfield took objection to this clause, on the ground that the bylaws, rather than the constitution, should define the duty of officers.

The chairman put the motion to carry the clause as above without amendment. Carried.

"SECTION VII.--Secretary--It shall be the duty of the Secretary to take the minutes of the meeting and conduct the correspondence of the Association, subject to the Board of Directors.' Carried.

SECTION VIII.—Treasurer.—It shall be the duty of the Treasurer to collect all funds, and disburse the same on the order of the Secretary when countersigned by the chairman of the Board of Directors." Carried.



Moved by Mr. Arnoldi, seconded by Mr. Storm, that instead of Section IX as primed, a Section numbered 9. be inserted as follows.

SECTION IX.---Auditors.—Two auditors shall be appointed at each annual meeting to audit the books of the Association, and report at the next annual meeting." Carried.

"SECTION X.—Amendments.—The Constitution may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the Fellows present at any regular meeting."

Moved in amendment by Mr. Rastrick, seconded by Mr. Watts, that Section X. be amended to read as follows: That the Constitution may be amended by a two-thirds vote of the Members present at any annual meeting. That one month's notice in writing must be given to the Secretary of such proposed amendment, the Secretary to transmit a copy of such notice to each member, at least 14 days previous to the annual meeting. Any member from unavoidable circumstances unable to attend, or if absent from the meeting, may delegate any other member to vote for him at any meeting of the Association, but such authorization must be in writing within one month of the date of the meeting." carried.

"SECTION XI.—Status of Architect.—The status of an architect is here. by defined as follows An architect is a professional person whose sole ostensible occupation consists in supplying data preliminary to the material construction and completion of buildings, in exercising administrative control over the operations of contractors supplying material and labor incident to the construction and completion of buildings, and in officiating as arbitrator of contracts, stipulating terms of obligations and fulfillment between proprietor and contractor

In amendment to the above it was moved by Mr. Alexander, seconded by Mr. Burke, that Clause XI. read as follows : The status of an architect is hereby defined as follows: An architect is a professional person whose occupation consists in supplying drawings, specifications and other data preliminary to the material construction and completion of buildings, in exercising administrative control over the operations of contractors supplying material and labor incident to the construction and completion of buildings, and in officiating as arbitrator of contracts, stipulating terms of obligations and fulfillment between proprietor and contractor." Carried.

Mr. Burke moved, seconded by Mr. Townsend, that the following Clause be next inserted:

SECTION XII.—Compensation.—No Member shall accept direct or indirect, compensation for services rendered in the practice of this profession other than the fees received from his clients."

This was received with great applause and carried unanimously.

"SECTION XIII.—Failure to Pay Dues.—Should any member fail for one year to pay his dues, the Board of Directors may at its discretion, drop his name from the roll.



SECTION XIV.—Misconduct.—Should charges of misconduct be preferred against any member, they must be made in writing, and be signed by the person making such charges; whereupon the Hoard of Directors, at its next meeting, must take the matter up, and the said Board may. at its discretion, drop the name from the roll, and the decision of the Board shall be final and absolute. The member against whom the charges are made shall, however, have the right to be heard in his own defence."

Mr. Bousfield was of the opinion that the offences for which any member might be expelled, should be inserted in the clause. The chairman said in reply that it was the intention of the organization to have a committee on Ethics, and on the respectable practice of the profession, and he thought other offences against the common good would fall within the discretionary powers of the Board of Directors.

This clause concluded the consideration of the constitution seriatim, and Mr. Gregg moved, seconded by Mr. Bousfield, "That we do now adopt the Constitution as just considered. Carried.

Before the consideration of the by-laws, these nominations were made to the chair, to form a nominating committee to recommend officers for the current year: Messrs Darling and Strickland, Toronto; Balfour and Mulligan, Hamilton; Alexander, Ottawa; McBride, London: Power, Kingston; and Belcher, Peterboro. These gentlemen then withdrew so as to have their nominations before the meeting before first adjournment,

The meeting then proceeded to consider the by-laws.

ARTICLE 1.—The annual meeting of this Association shall be held upon the third Wednesday in November, and at such a place as shall be designated by a majority vote of members at the previous meeting.

Moved in amendment by Mr. Arnoldi, seconded by Mr. Wilson, that the word November be eliminated, and February substituted therefor. In making this motion, Mr, Arnoldi said he thought that November was probably the busiest season of the year. He knew it was in Ottawa and presumed it was elsewhere. This was a matter worthy of consideration by
