<article title=" NOTES." author="">NOTES.



We may well ponder over the fact says the London Builders Journal, that Sweden sends us yearly £300,000 worth of setts and kerbs, manufactured goods, duty free. We may well think over the significance of this, and bear in mind, as an example, that the Dartmoor quarries have lost a considerable portion of their trade in these setts and kerbs because Norwegian quarry-owners can nay their workmen less money and send their finished material into our ports without paying any duty on it.
