<article title=" NOTES." author="">NOTES.

The report of the building inspector of Vancouver shows that during the eight months since October 1st, 1903, there have been erected in that city 568 dwellings and over 100 buildings for

business purposes.



As mentioned in a previous number it had been decided to remove the Eiffel Tower in Paris, but this decision has now been changed, and the Tower is to remain and to be adapted for use

as a wireless telegraph station. The civil engineers of France presented a request that the Tower be not taken down, and the Minister of War conceived the idea of using it as a Military Station for receiving and sending wireless telegraph dispatches.



The inventor, Mr. Ejifel, being anxious that the structure should remain, offered to pay all the expenses incurred in adapting it to its new purpose.
