<person>BROTHERSON</person> V. <person>CURRY</person>.—Judgment in the Divisional Court at Toronto, (E.B.B.) on motion by plaintiff to set asde non-suit entered by <person>Lount, J.</person>, in an action for negligence tried at Peterborough, and for a new trial.

Laverdure</person>, contractors for the construction of a section of the Trent Valley Canal, to recover damages for injuries received by plaintiff while engaged in working for defendants in such construction. A derrick used in the work fell upon plaintiff owing to the alleged negligence of defendants in not sufficiently supporting the derrick, and by reason of a defect therein. <person>Held, Britton J.</person>, dissenting, that the non—suit was right and should not be disturbed, because no negligence on the part of defendants was shown. It is not a case in which the doctrine of resio saloquitor should be applied, because evidence of proper and careful construction was given by defendants <person>Scott</person> v. <firm>London Dock Co.</firm>. 3 II. & C. 596, <person>Moffat</person> v. <person>Batemen, L. R. </person>



c.	P. 115, <person>Black</person> v. <firm>Ontario Wheel Co.</firm>, 19 0. R. 578. Motion dismissed with costs. The case is one, therefore, in which the jury are asked to say that the derrick was negligently constructed, when no witness on either side has said so, and where the only opinion expressed by any witness is that it was properly and not negligently constructed. The case is within the doctrine laid down in <person>Walsh</person> v. <person>Whitely</person>, 21 Q. H. D. at p. 378.

<person>BOOTH</person> v<person>. BOOTH</person>.--Judgement by Justice's Meredith and Britton in the <building>Divisional Court at Toronto</building>, on appeal by the landowner in a summary proceeding to enforce a mechanics lien, from the judgment of the Master at Belleville in favor of the plaintiff, who is the husband of the defendant <person>J. A. Booth</person>. The work and materials for which the lien is claimed upon his land, are alleged to have been performed and furnished in making repairs to a house, situate on these lands, which had been damaged by fire. The plaintiff agreed with his wife and her mother, who owned the adjoining building, both buildings being under the same roof, to repair both for $886.75. Held, that a lien may attach on the land of each owner where the buildings are repaired under their joint contract, as in this case, tar one entire price, provided a separate account has been kept. R.S.O. ch. 153, sec. 4, creates the lien, and by sec. 7 it attaches upon the estate of the owner as defined by sec 2 (3). The Master has properly found that the plaintiff has brought himself within these provisions. The work, etc., was done at the request of the wife, and plaintiff is entitled to a lien on her estate, limited to the amount justly due. The price may be apportioned. This has been done in the United States. <person>Butler</person> v. <person>Rivers, R. J. </person>38; <person>Ballou</person> v. <person>Black</person>, 17 Neb. 389. The Master found that the lien was registered within the time, and the action brought within the time limited of sees. 22 and 23, and as there is evidence to support his conclusion, it should not be disturbed. There was also evidence to establish the work done, and the materials furnished for the part of the building which belonged to the wife. The Master's finding should not be disturbed even though he had found the other way on the evidence. It cannot be said he was wrong, and unless it can, his findings should not be set aside. Appeal dismissed.

<article title=" LUDLAM V. WILSON " author="">

<person>LUDLAM</person> V. <person>WILSON</person>.—Judgment by Court of Appeal at Toronto on appeal by plaintiffs from judgment of <person>Falconbridge, C. J.</person>, dismissing action brought for price of material and work done under a contract made by defendant with one <person>Craddock</person> for the erection of a house on West Wellington street, in Chatham. <person>Craddock</person> tailed to perform and plaintiffs agreed to do so. The money was to be paid upon the certificate of the Superintendent named in the contract, but plaintiffs allege that he is so under the influence and direction of the defendant, so inexperienced and so



prejudiced, that he refuses to give any certificate. The trial Judge held that a case had not been made out which would justify him in declaring that plaintiffs were relieved from the necessity of procuring a certificate. Held, that the plaintiffs did not contract, as Craddock did, to furnish and do additional carpenter work, and that term of Craddock's contract is not imported into plaintiff's contract, which must be read according

to its subject matter, ie., as a contract to furnish specified material and to do the carpentering work mentioned in the amended tender, and, therefore, the stipulation that all the "conditions" of Craddock's contract are to apply to the plaintiff's contract cannot import into the latter an agreement to "furnish and do" any extra additional carpentry work required by the defendant. For any material, therefore, or work done beyond that tendered and expressly contracted for, the plaintiff is entitled to recover without a certificate. his contract. must. be read with reference to what he has assumed to do, and so must the provision as to payment and though he was to obtain the Superintendent's final certificate of completion, that means the completion of his own contract, not of some one else's. The evidence justifies the inference that the defendant discharged the



plaintiffs from doing anything further under their contract that is the meaning to be taken from the certificate and the evidence of the defendant and his Superintendent as to the reasons for giving the certificate of the 14th February. The contract was thereby terminated, and the necessity for any further certificate waived. Appeal allowed with costs. Reference to Master at Chatham of all matters in difference. Defendant to pay costs to arid including hearing Further directions and subsequent costs reserved.
