So far the volume of business done this year in Montreal has been very satisfactory, and the aggregate is quite up to that of last year.

The demand for building material has kept dealers busy and fully supplied the mills and factories with work. In some cases increases in price have caused inconvenience. while in some instances actual losses have been sustained. It is expected that for next year a general readjustment will have to take place. 

The increase in the cost of living has created a demand for more wages, but during the year Montreal arid district have been almost free from strikes and labor disputes.

Branch banks continue to spring up in the city and vicinity, one of the latest being for the Royal Bank of Canada at the corner of Sherbrooke street and Victoria avenue, Westmount. The two elevations are treated in a simple way, the banking room on the ground floor being emphasized with large windows between small pilasters. while above the entablature is a small attic, containing apartments for the use of the manager. The exterior is built entirely of Roman stone. The composition is good, although perhaps appearing a little stunted owing to its resting on a very small base. Besides the main hall there is a ladies' room as well as the manger's, and other necessary offices. The safes are situated in the basement, together with a large book room and lavatories. The main entrance is on Sherbrooke street and leads directly into time banking hall. Mr. H. C. Stone is the architect. The contractors were Messrs. John Stewart & Company, the fittings being supplied by the Canada Office & School Furniture Company. The building is heated with hot water, and lighted by electric light.

Down town the number of new banks is notable, so much so that we hope to publish soon illustrations and details of the chief ones.

The new branch post-office on St. Catherine street is certainly a striking addition to the architecture of the thoroughfare. It is situated near University street, and is a most convenient place for the growing number of business premises in time locality. It has a frontage of fifty-one feet and a depth of ninety feet, and is three storeys in height. The base of the building is of granite and the rest of the front of Nova Scotia sandstone of a very pleasing shade. On thie ground floor are two entrances, one for the public and one for the offices on the other floors. The second and third floor windows are spaced between four Greek Ionic columns arid generally the whole facade is treated in the same classic manner, making an imposing building. The ground floor is to be used entirely for public purposes and working rooms, while time two upper floors will be occupied by time postmaster. The construction is steel with terra cotta partitions and floors, the interior being finished irm oak amid plaster. The architect is Mr. Maurice Perrault, acting jointly with Mr. D. Ewart, chief architect of public works at Ottawa.
