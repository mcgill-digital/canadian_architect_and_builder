THE rapidity with which all Classes of people, of both sexes, have adopted the use of the bicycle as a means of pleasant exercise and for practical use, has been the subject of general astonishment. When the bicycle was introduced it was regarded by many in the light of a fad, which would disappear as speedily as it came. But time has proved the incorrectness of this opinion. Architects and contractors have to find the bicycle extremely serviceable in enabling them to get about rapidly from one piece of work to another. The question of providing bicycle accommodation is one which must be taken into account by the architect when planning for the erection of buildings in the future. The suggestion has been made that the stable should he spacious, convenient 10 the street and tinder the eye of the elevator man.



IN this number of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER appears a facsimile letter from Messrs. Elliott & Son, the well-known firm of decorators, in which they bear testimony to the excellent results which have followed the continued insertion of their advertisement in this Journal. As the authors of this letter have advertised continuously for five or six years past, their testimony is worthy of attention. The fact that the advertisers whose letters we publish handle different lines of goods, though all designed for use in building construction, proves conclusively that the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is the best medium through which to reach architects, engineers and contractors throughout Canada. Persons who have anything to sell to these classes should be represented in the advertisement pages of this Journal. Will the purchasers of supplies also kindly mention the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER in their correspondence with manufacturers and dealers.



WITHIN a short time quite a marked change has taken place in Toronto in the manner of carrying on business by roofers and galvanized iron workers. Many of those who formerly did only slate, tile and felt roofing have added general galvanized iron work to their business ; other firms who formerly confined themselves to sheet metal work are in the field for all kinds of roofing. This has no doubt been brought about partly by the custom of architects in specifying for all iron work which is strictly part of the roof to be included in one contract, and making the roofer responsible for the whole being water tight There also appears to be a certain amount of retaliation on the part of each trade, caused by the other having taken up the additional line of business. There are strong indications that competition will grow so keen that prices will be cut below a reasonable point. While we would not advocate the restriction of competition in business, we (10 not think the present condition of affairs is likely to secure the doing of a satisfactory grade of work.



Reference was made in this Journal recently to the financial difficulties in which some church congregations had placed themselves through a desire to worship in expensive buildings. The matter has assume(l such a serious aspect that at the last meeting of the Toronto Conference of the Methodist Church the following resolution was adopted : "That this conference is of the Opinion that additional guarantees should be provided against the unfortunate tendency that prevails so largely to strain the law affecting the inception of new and the enlargement of existing church enterprises, and recommends that the general conference be memorialized to provide legislation which will require the co-operation of the chairmen of districts with the quarterly board in advance of either the enlargement or building of an
