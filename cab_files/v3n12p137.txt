The placing of windows was an important matter Looking at the Board of Trade buildings he noticed that some of the windows had been placed in such a way as to detract from the utility of the building. Another important matter he desired to draw attention to was the building of stairways. So narrow had the Stairs of the Bank of Commerce been made that the other day a portly costumer was unable to ascend them and the manager had to he called down to see him. (Laughter).

The Chairman proposed the toast of "The Ladies, and called upon Mr. <person>A. Clarence Barrett</person>. Mr. Barrett in a few well chosen remarks passed an eulogy on the fair sex which drew forth much applause.

The Chairman said the next toast was that of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER This paper was a benefit that few could properly estimate. In the past it had done exceedingly well considering the field that is open for it in Canada. Of course there were people who said the paper should be this, or should he that, but these people who were freest with advice gave it the least substantial assistance. The CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER compared very favorably with the architectural papers of England and the United States when they were of similar age, and the time would come when it would rank with any publication of the kind in the world.

The toast was drunk with enthusiasm, the company singing "For it's a jolly good journal" to the tune of" He's a jolly good fellow."

Mr. <person>C. H. Mortimer </person>in replying thanked those present for the kind and hearty manner in which the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER had

been referred to.

The toast to "The Press" was responded to by Mr<person>. J. A. Radford</person>.

The company dispersed after singing "Auld Lang Syne."

During the evening an excellent musical programme was rendered Mr. <person>J. J. Woolnough </person>presided at the piano. The programme was as follows

<article title="Inception and progress of the Ontario Association of Architects" author="">INCEPTION AND PROGRESS OF THE <assoc>ONTARIO ASSOCIATION OF ARCHITECTS</assoc>.



O

N the third day of October, 1887, nine architects of the City of Toronto met in Mr. <person>W. G. Storm</person>'s office and determined to form a society with the object of advancing the interests of architecture, and to bring about a better feeling between the members of the profession. The attempt had been made before with some degree of success, but owing to a number of Causes the society then formed died a natural death in its infancy, leaving behind little or nothing to keep its memory green except a few debts which were liquidated by the officers without any assistance from the members. But the society formed on the third of Oct., 1887, has had a very different course, as it is in a most active condition at the present date, after an existence of more than three years. In proof that it is in active working order, we may say that it has twenty-four members in good standing and a cash balance of nearly $750.

It is not, however, of the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Guild </assoc>that we desire to speak, but of the formation and existence of the Ontario Association of Architects. On the 8th of Nov., 1888, the members of the Toronto Architectural Guild made their first move to form a permanent Association by appointing the following committee, viz. Messrs. <person>D. B. Dick</person>, <person>Strickland</person>, <person>Burke</person>, <person>Lennox, </person>Storm, <person>Townsend</person>, <person>Langton</person>, <person>Darling</person>, <person>Langley</person>, <person>Gordon </person>and the Secretary (<person>Curry</person>), to prepare and submit a scheme to the Guild.

As the result of the Guild's efforts, the Ontario Association of Architects was formed on March 21st, 1889, at the <building>Queen's Hotel, Toronto</building>. About sixty members of the profession attended from all parts of the province, who, with but one or two exceptions, became active members of the Association.

After the meeting had been properly organized, it took into consideration the By-laws which had been prepared by a special committee, and passed them with some slight changes. The next business was the election of officers, who were as follows

W.	G. Storm, Toronto, President; <person>Geo. Durand</person>, London, first Vice-President; <person>E. King Arnoldi, </person>Ottawa, second Vice- President; and <person>Jas. Balfour</person>, Hamilton, third Vice-President. <person>S. H. Townsend</person>, Toronto, was elected Secretary, and D. B. Dick, Toronto, Treasurer. The following members were elected to the Council: Edmund Burke, Toronto; <person>J. Belcher</person>, Peterborough; <person>Jos. Power</person>, Kingston; Mulligan, Hamilton, and <person>S. G. Curry</person>, Toronto.

In the evening the visitors were entertained at dinner at the Queen's by the members of the Toronto Architectural Guild, and there was formed an Association of Architects which in the short period of one year was to become the first incorporated Association of Architects in the world.

During the summer months of 1889 the membership of the Association increased to ninety members. In Nov. of that year the first annual convention was held in the Canadian Institute building, Toronto. The convention was in every way a success, the exhibition of drawings being very much superior to what was expected. At this meeting it was determined to apply to the Legislative Assembly of Ontario for an Act of Incorporation. A draft of the proposed Act was submitted and adopted, and nothing more could be done until the meeting of the Ontario Legislature. On the evening of the last day of the convention the visiting members were entertained at dinner by the Toronto members at Harry Webb's restaurant. One of the toasts of the

evening was "Success to the proposed Act of Incorporation," but while many drank to the toast, by far the greater number looked upon the attempt to secure incorporation as a forlorn hope. The Act was submitted to the Ontario Legislature at its last session and became law, but only after many changes had been made in the wording. The Government had deemed the measure of such public importance that it had made it a Government Bill. Some opposition was made to the Bill by members of the profession who were afraid that it might injure them in some undefinable manner. To what extent this opposition affected the Bill It is hard to say, as the Committee were not aware at the time that there was any opposition to the passing of an Act of such great advantage to the profession in its desire for advancement. After some delay on the part of the Government the Council was gazetted. The members are Messrs. W.

G.	Storm, <person>F. J. Rascrick </person>and D. B. Dick for three years; King Arnoldi, <person>W. A. Edwards </person>and <person>David Ewart </person>for two years; and Edmund Burke, <person>Win. Blackwell </person>and S. G. Curry for one year. The names of the old Council which had been elected by the Association were given to the Government from which to select the new Council, but of the number they only appointed six, selecting the balance of three from among the members of the Association. The Council met and organized according to the proclamation, and did such business as was possible on the occasion of their first meeting. A second meeting was held by the Council on December 3rd and 4th. At this meeting draft by-laws for the Association and Council were considered. The qualifications necessary for enrollment as student were also settled, as well as the examinations which he would be required to pass before he can become a properly qualified member of the Association. Another meeting of the Council will be necessary before the annual meeting in February to give the final touches to the above measures.

The first annual meeting of the incorporated society will take place on the third Tuesday in February, when a very full attendance of the members is expected. The success of the Association is assured if ordinary care is observed in electing suitable men on the Council. Let us hope that the members of the Association will have its interests sufficiently at heart to select capable and energetic men to this position.
