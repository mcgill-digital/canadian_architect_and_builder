is one of the greatest stumbling blocks to the advancement of the profession. There cannot be good-fellowship among architects while petty jealousies and disloyalty prevail. Neither can clients whose attention is drawn to these things be expected to hold the profession in highest esteem.



A Toronto contractor assures us that builders in that city are receiving very small profits from

their undertakings. The times are prosperous and plenty of building is being done, but it is claimed that the keenness of competition and high prices of labor and materials are proving an off-set, and standing in the way of proper returns to the contractor. There are said to be about two-hundred building contractors in Toronto at the present time, which is far too large a number even in prosperous times like the present. Some of these men are so anxious to get a large amount of work that they tender at ridiculously low figures and thus lower the standard of prices all round. A much wiser course would be for all tenderers to allow in their estimates for a fair margin of profit, and thus assist in securing for builders their share of the results of the prevailing prosperity. If when the times are good little or no profit can be made, the outlook will be gloom y indeed when hard times shall return.



A lecture was recently given by William McDevitt, Insurance Inspector, before the Fire Insurance Society of Philadelphia, in which the explosive quality of hot smoke was demonstrated. The author explained that. in a fire, free carbon rises and mixes with hydrogen; methyl-alcohol, creosote and other gases are also present in smoke. These gases become heated to the point of ignition, and an explosion is the result. Of itself, smoke would explode at a temperature of from 600 to 800 degrees, but frequently the smoke is ignited by sparks or by coming into contact with a flame. Very thick smoke, when ignited, becomes a pillar of flame, and rolls through a room with such force as to shake the walls and make the windows rattle. If sprinkled with water there would be no explosion. Where formerly firemen tried to keep smoke in, under the impression that it smothered the fire, they now immediately break in windows or skylights to let it out. The construction of a central shaft in large stores and other buildings was recommended as one of the best methods of avoiding smoke explosions.



The beauty of the Muskoka

Lakes and their value as a health

resort have been published far and wide over the continent. As a consequence the number of persons who summer there is steadily increasing year by year. Dr. Bryce, the efficient head of the Provincial Health Department is keenly alive to the necessity of securing the adoption of such sanitary precautions as will maintain as nearly as possible the original purity of the air and water on these lakes. Most of the hotels, including the new Royal Muskoka, are fitted with the septic tank system of sewage disposal described by Dr. Bryce in his admirable paper read before the Ontario Association of Architects last year. Last summer the further step was taken of placing a septic tank on one of the Muskoka Navigation Coin-

pany's steamers. The experiment is said to have proved entirely successful, all the sewage from the vessel with the exception of the liquids was consumed by the bacteria in the tank. It is probable that next year all the steamers on these lakes w11 be provided with septic tanks, thus stopping to a large extent the pollution of the water and greatly reducing the possibility of the spread of disease.
