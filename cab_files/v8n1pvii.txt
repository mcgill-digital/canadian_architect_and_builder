Mr. <person>Arthur J. Cooke, </person>will shortly open an office in Montreal for the practice  of architecture.

Mr <person>William Laurence Munro </person>has opened an office for the practice of architecture at No. 10 Main street east, Hamilton.

Mr. <person>George Browne</person>, architect, Winnipeg, is at present spending a couple of months in Ontario, making his headquarters at Hamilton.



A fortnight ago, in company with a number of Ontario lumbermen, the subject of shingles came up for discussion. There was a time when the term shingles, so far as this province is concerned, simply meant white pine shingles, but with the . introduction of the red cedar shingles of British Columbia, and, though only to a limited extent, the white cedar shingle of New Brunswick, conditions have changed. The Pacific Coast people

tell of the red cedar shingle as showing no signs of decadence, after having been 30 years and more on a roof. Ontario lumbermen may be prejudiced against their red cedar rival. It is the case that on this occasion they were of one mind that whether it was owing to the process of kiln drying, or what not, red cedar shingles were not even now proving satisfactory. "It is all very well," said one, "to talk of the longevity of this shingle, but I doubt if on the Pacific Coast they are put to the test of the severe east rains and snow storms that we get in Ontario, and which will test almost any roof if not well covered, both as regards material and workmanship. I hear complaints of shingles that have only been two or three years in Ontario, as unable to withstand the rains of this province." Probably this point will be disputed by our friends on the Pacific coast.



DURABILITY OF SLATE.—Writing on the durability of slate when exposed, Mr.

A.	C. Kimber says: "In the Granary Burying Ground, in Boston, there is a stone of slate erected to the memory of Captain William Condy, who died August 25, 1685 The style of lettering. position, &c., all indicate that it was put there soon after the burial. Yet every letter is clear and sharp, even the guiding lines scratched with the chisel being perfectly distinct. In fact, the stone seems to have suffered no change whatever. There are many others near it in the same condition, and of nearly equal age."
