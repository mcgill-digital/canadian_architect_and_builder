USEFUL HINTS <article title=" USEFUL HINTS " author="">

A yellowish-brown luminous paint is obtained from 48 parts and pigment and 34 pairs luminous calcium sulfide.

One-fifth more siding and flooring in needed than the number of square feet of surface to be covered, because of the lap in the siding and machinery.

The ends of all timbers, and especially of large beams should bc free (for it is through the ends that moisture chiefly evaporates). They should on no account be embedded in mortar, Beams may appear sound externally and he rotten within, for the outside being in contact with the air, becomes dryer than the interior. It is well, therefore, to saw and reverse all large scantling, <article title=" PLASTER USED FOR FLOORING " author="">

PLASTER USED FOR FLOORINGâ€”it is stated by an exchange that French builders, who have carried the art (If hardening plaster to where it is used for flooring, either in place of wood or tile, employ for this purpose six parts of good quality of plaster intimately mixed with one part of freshly slacked white lime finely sifted. The mixture as thus composed is laid down in as quick time as possible care being taken that the trowel is not used upon the surface for too long a time; after this the floor is allowed to become very dry, and is subsequently saturated in the most thorough manner with sulfate of iron or zinc, the iron giving the strongest surface, its resistance to breaking being found to be 20 times the strength of ordinary plaster. it appears that with sulfate of zinc the floors remain white, while when iron is used it becomes the color of rusted iron but if linseed oil, boiled with litharge, he applied to the surface, it becomes of an attractive mahogany color, this being especially the case if a coat of copal varnish is added

To test the purity of white lead is not a different matter and does not necessitate a knowledge of chemistry. 'the simplest way is to crush a small quantity of dry lead on a sheet of paper, fold it, and holding it over a plate or saucer, set fire to it. The heat will change the white lead, if pure into metallic lead, which will drop in the form of shining grains; if it is adulterated, no indications of metal will be apparent. Another method is to spread a thick layer of the lead over a very thin pine board. On burning it, the metallic particles will be visible only when the lead is pure. A more accurate method than either is that of using charcoal and blow-pipe. Take a flat piece of charcoal about three inches long, one inch wide, and one-fourth of an inch thick, hollow out a small cavity and see within it a piece of the suspected lead about the size of a pea Then take a blow- pipe and a spirit lamp, amid direct the flame on the lead ; keep up a continual and steady blowing, and allow the blue part of the flame to reach the earl. In a couple of minutes the lead, if pure will be reduced to a small shining piece of pure metallic lead ; if it lie adulterated, no amount of blowing will produce the same result. A tobacco pipe (common clay), having a small stem may, at a pinch, be used as a blowpipe.

by Venetian blind manufacturers for painting their blinds. This varnish is mixed with the desired color, mostly green, and when painted gives a hard gloss enamel surface.
