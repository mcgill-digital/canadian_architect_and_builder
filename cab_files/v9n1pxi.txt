TORONTO SKETCH CLUB.

A meeting of the Toronto Sketch Club was held in the office of Mr. E. B. Jarvis, on Tuesday, Dec. 17th, when designs for a gable were submitted by the members. After a lengthy criticism by Mr. Jarvis a discussion took place and the designs were voted on. Mr.

R.	T. Johnson's design was placed first. His design was a beautiful hit of French half timbered work and the pencil rendering was perfect. Mr. W. P. Over was placed second with a design for a church transept gable, English perpendicular Gothic. Thirteen designs were submitted at this meeting.

The third regular meeting was held in the office of Messrs. Darling, Sproatt & Pearson, on Monday evening, January 6th. The subject for competition was a mantle and fireplace. Mr. Frank Darling acted as critic. This meeting was hardly as well attended as the previous ones, although eleven designs ~vere sent in. It was decided in voting for the designs, to give one place for draughtsmen and one for students, for, as it

was before, the students had practically no chance of obtaining a place. Mr. R. T. Johnson's design was placed first for the draughtsmen. It was a beautiful composition in the style of Francis I. Mr. Ford Howard's design was placed first in the students.

The next meeting will be held in the office of Messrs. Strickland & Symons, on Tuesday, January 2 1st, when Mr. Wickson will criticize. The subject is one more for composition than detail. The problem is A Tower at the corner of a Court-yard, and an entrance at one side and gable at the other side of Tower. The view is to be taken from inside the court. The size of paper was also specified to be 250 inches area.
