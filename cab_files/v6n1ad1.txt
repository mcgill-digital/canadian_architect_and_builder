-- The World-Renowned - - -



STAR BOILER

The Star Boiler is the only reliable one in every case, and gives the

highest satisfaction when all others have failed. Unequalled in finish, heating

capacity and economy in fuel. The largest and finest buildings on the continent are being heated with the STAR BOILER.











 NOTWITHSTANDING all the improvements which had been made in hot water heating, there was still an objection, which was very difficult to overcome, and which gave rise to many vexatious disappointments and disagreements. This was, that the radiators on the lower

floors, and especially in the basement, never heated	 as well as those on the upper floors. The water, when heated in the furnace, was apt to rise to the upper stories in preference to the lower ones, and it was only when the circulation was well established in the upper coils that the coils on the lower floors commenced to heat, and, even then, the heat developed very slowly and necessitated a large consumption of fuel.

Having studied the most improved systems of

heating, we have succeeded in building a furnace

with a syphon-injector, by the aid of which the circulation in the coils on the lower stories is increased

by the speed of the circulation in the coils of the upper stories. This important invention, which we have patented, works admirably and gives great satisfaction.
