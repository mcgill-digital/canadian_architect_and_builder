THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



NOTES.

If these people with German names who are threatening us with bricks of sand and lime can manage to give us some with a porous or cellular, lava-like structure—like the porous terra cotta, only much more so—we can use them to advantage in many situations as heat-savers. Some one may yet produce bricks of

<doctype type="text;ad">this cellular quality, but of material so hard and glassy as to be impervious to storm and grime. Imagination finds but a step from this to a brick for light outer walls that shall have the further quality of translucence but imagination can hardly enumerate half the uses that would be found for such a building material.
