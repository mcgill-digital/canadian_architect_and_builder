As the result of differences between the proprietors and workmen at the <firm>Penhoyn quarries in Wales</firm>, re— suiting in the closing of the quarries some two or three years ago, the attention of Welsh quarrymen has been directed to the slate deposits of Newfoundland. Several of these deposits have been purchased and development work commenced. A Newfoundland correspondent of the <firm>Montreal Gazette</firm> writes on the subject as follows:

"It looks as if the export of slate were about to become an important industry amongst us. A Welsh gentle— man, Mr. <person>0. J. Owens</person>, arrived here on Monday last from \Vales to commence the work of development on a newly—discovered slate quarry at Bay of Islands. He has a life—long experience in the work and after examining- the properly gave it as his opinion that it was the largest and most valuable deposit in the world. The original owner of the claim was R. G. Reid, railway contractor. He disposed of it to Mr. Owens on very reasonable terms, influenced principally by a desire to bring about mineral development along the line of rail-

		of immigrants to conic

way and induce a large number

from Wales and help to build up and people this part

of the country. Mr. Owens, in order to help on the Furtherance of these views, has published a hook on the subject of Newfoundland's slate deposits in the Welsh language, and has circulated it widely among his countrymen. The slate quarry at Smith's Sound, Trinity Bay, is now a well-established industry, and is worked principally by Welshman who say there is a great future For slate in Newfoundland. Last year 2,000 tons, equal to 6,ooo squares, valued at $22,500, were exported. It was shipped to London and Newcastle, where a ready sale at remunerative prices was obtained. The shipping facilities are remarkably easy and vessels of any size can lay alongside within a stone's throw of the quarry, and in perfect safety. The quarry is of immense proportions and there is sufficient material in sight to last for generations''.
