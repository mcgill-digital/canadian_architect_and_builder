the early collapse of many of the tall buildings of that city in which imperfect steel construction has been employed, In the earlier buildings of this class, the steel framework instead of being imbedded in concrete, was simply cased with stone or brickwork, leaving crevices through which moisture might enter and corrode the metal. Under such conditions corrosion proceeds very rapidly, and the corrosion of one fifth of the substance of the metal of a supporting member at any given point would in general, cause its failure. In view of <person>General Sooysmith</person>'s warning it is urged that an immediate examination should be quietly made of buildings of thc class to which he has referred, and measures taken to prevent an accident which would involve loss of life and so weaken public confidence in the stability of such structures as to seriously depreciate their value. Such an examination would also be likely to disclose facts of which architects should be possessed.



By request of a number of prominent

British architects, <assoc>the Royal Institute </assoc>will appoint a special committee to

receive suggestions and formulate a plan whereby necessary reforms may he effected in the method of conducting competitions. In view of the unsatisfactory results of several important competitions held recently in England, the conclusion has been reached that in undertakings of a technical or complicated nature more than one referee is required. It is suggested that in such cases there should be two—one to be chosen because of undoubled ability as a designer the other for his special knowledge of the particular problem to be considered. In case these two should be unable to agree to an award it is proposed that they be empowered to elect a third architect as umpire It is suggested that a list of architects in whom competitors have confidence he supplied to the president of' the Institute, from which list a choice of referees could bc made. It is urged that in cases where the promoter of a competition fails from any cause to carry out the undertaking it should be agreed that a substantial money paymcnt should be made to the author of the selected design on about the same scale as if he has been commissioned direct to prepare plans without any competition.





THE Opening of the building season this year has been marked by more than the usual number of strikes embracing bricklayers, carpenters, painters, plumbers, and last of all the architectural structural ironworkers. Most of the disputes have been adjusted for the present season at least on a compromise basis, without much loss of time. The higher standard of wages which has been fixed in the various trades, has blocked quite a large percentage of building projects which would otherwise have gone forward this season. As an example a contractor who submitted tenders for four buildings states that only one of the four was proceeded with on account of the tenders being too high. The opinion prevails that the ever increasing demands of the unions for higher pay and shorter working hours, coupled with other restrictions almost too numerous to mention, will prove to be one of the most potent influences in bringing ¼ an end the present period of prosperity. The broadening of the franchise has placed

great political power in the hands of the labor leaders, which they have not been slow to exercise. As a result legislative bodies are pandering to them as never before, and are in danger of losing sight of the national welfare, which demands equal justice to all classes and the protection of capital as well as labor. It should not be forgotten that the interests of both are identical and that any advantage given the one over the other can only bc temporary. We should take warning by the experience of our sister colonies of Australia where the results of the labor laws are thus described in a letter by Mr. <person>D H Ross </person>a Canadian, to <person>Sir Richard Cartwright</person> Dominion Minister of Trade and Commerce

The labor laws throughout the Commonwealth and New Zealand are of such character that the careful business man or capitalist seeking an investment would hesitate indefinitely before placing his business and capital under the sole control of the labor unions, which are so strong at the present time that they practically hold the balance of political power, and throw in their support with either party Government or Opposition, which will agree to carry Out their so-called labor reforms. A manufacturer's business is tinder their control to the extent that they dictate its policy, the number of employees permitted, the number of apprentices, their hours of labor, their rate of wages their days of vacation, how the factory shall be lighted and ventilated, and so on, ad lib. Owing to these tyrannical labor laws, boot manufactures in Melbourne who, previous to the federal tariff were protected to the extent of' $1.20 per pair on men's boots, were scarcely able to make both ends meet. In Wellington N.Z. , was recently stated that a large boot manufacturer there had decided to close his factory and become an importer, and boot operatives have recently arrived here from New Zealand looking for employment."





THE near approach of the coronation of <person>King Edward the VII </person>lends interest to the following particulars

regarding the history of the famous coronation stone That this stone was formerly in use in Ireland for the Coronation ceremony that it found its way into Scotland—certainly earlier than the reign of <person>King Kenneth</person>, 834—that it was then removed to <building>the Abbey of Scone</building>, where for 450 years all the kings of Scotland were crowned upon it. and that it was brought to England by <person>King Edward 1</person>. in 1296 after <person>John Baliol</person>, the Scottish King, had been defeated at Dunbar, are well ascertained historic events. There used to be a tradition that the stone was of meteoric origin, but <person>Dean Stanley </person>settled this matter when in his '' Memorials of Westminster Abbey" he included a paper written by <person>Professor Ramsay</person>, called "A Geological Account of the Coronation Stone," in which it is said "The stone is a dull reddish or purplish sandstone, strongly resembling that of the doorway of <building>Dunstaffnage Castle</building>, which was probably built of the stone of the neighbourhood. It is extremely improbable that it was derived from the rocks of me hill of Tara, from whence it is said to have been transported to Scotland, neither could it have been taken from the rocks of lona. That it belonged originally to the rocks round Bethel is equally unlikely, while Egypt is not. known to furnish any strata similar to the red sandstone of the Coronation Stone."
