NOTICE OF REMOVAL.



Subscribers and advertisers are asked to note that on the first of May the



branch office of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER in Montreal will be removed to the New York Life Insurance Building.





THERE seems to be evidence that building in New York, which was so dull at the end of last summer that many offices closed up altogether, is becoming active again.



WE have received a letter of recent date from a contractor in Vancouver, B. C., containing some practical suggestions, and requesting that more space be given in this journal to such matters as more particularly concern the builder, naming mortars, concrete, stone setting, hoisting machinery, etc. We are now preparing some articles on these and similar lines, and in the course of the year will give our Vancouver friend and his fellow contractors reason to consider our promises in the January number well remembered.





MRS. CORNELIA COSTER, of New York, has died leaving a will which directs that the whole of her estate of a million dollars shall be applied to erecting a sepulchral monument to her memory in Woodlawn cemetery. If these are the terms of the will it will require some agility on the part of the law to sanction such a liberal interpretation as would admit of the erection of some memorial to fill a useful purpose. An exact fulfillment of the instructions would, if carried out in good taste, be a combination of conditions not usually required  of architects to keep down the size of the structure without failing to spend the money on it.



THE Citizens' Advertising Committee of Toronto, who have undertaken to watch over the attractiveness of the city, have turned their attention in the right direction in resolving, at their meeting on April 7th, to endorse the immediate improvement of the island lagoons, and the construction of miniature waterways and electric launches. The island is a great natural advantage and boon to Toronto now, and one cannot pass through the lagoons without being impressed with the possibilities of further development. But, in dealing with an opportunity of this kind, so much depends upon treatment that it is to be hoped that whatever body takes the matter up will take good advice. It is only an artist who can improve on Nature—by studying her effects and giving her improved opportunities to produce them. It would be easy with a crude idea conceived chiefly' on paper, to make of the island a place less attractive than it is now in the beauty of its partial wildness.



THE lecture on " Current Architectural Styles " recently delivered in the hail at the School of Practiced Science, Toronto, by Mr. Helliwell, and published in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT ANI) BUILDER last month, has received much favorable comment. Our attention has been called, however, to a peculiar omission from the examples of recent work shown on the canvas to illustrate the lecture, and the names of architects whose work is worthy of study, viz., that not one Canadian architect was mentioned nor a single view of Canadian work shown. This omission was the more noticeable from the fact that a large number of contemporary English and American architects were mentioned and recent examples of their work shown. Whatever explanation there may be to offer for the omission, we would suggest that it was hardly fair to the architects of Canada and their work. Perhaps it was owing to the lecturer's
