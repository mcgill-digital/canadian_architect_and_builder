DESECRATION OF THE TOWER OF LONDON.<article title=" DESECRATION OF THE TOWER OF LONDON " author="">

ANYTHING more atrocious than the new guard house at the tower of London could not well be imagined, says the London Builders' Journal. Not that the building itself is worse the general of buildings

designed in the present. age ; but to set down this fiery redâ€”brick erection with its staring stone dressings under the scarred grey walls of the White tower, pregnant with a nation's history, is a piece of vandalism that could only be accomplished in the nineteenth century. It would be interesting to know why a new guard house was needed at all, for no one can pretend that the tower is an active fortress upon whose efficiency the safety of the city in time of war depends, and the garrison it

possesses is there placed more as a courtesy to its past power and grandeur, for convenience sake and as a guard to the regalia, than as an active fighting force. As the years go by the public is being gradually shut out of the tower altogether, and it is becoming evident that from motives of economy the authorities desire to turn the place into barracks and end its more fitting career as a museum of feudal history. But even the total exclusion of the public from the tower would not justify the destruction of its beauties by such buildings as guard houses, and it is small balm to antiquarian feeling that the Roman citadel foundations and well have been generously preserved while the new erection remains to shriek our shame and inappreciation to the coming generations,
