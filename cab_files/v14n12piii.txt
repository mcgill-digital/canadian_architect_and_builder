1901 Greetings 1902



To Our Friends, The Architects:

We are near the dawn of another year, and we are still the acknowledged leaders in the art of making Radiators in Canada. There are many imitators of our well-known designs and construction, which proves conclusively our title to the claim that Safford Radiators are the Best.

We have completed arrangements for producing many new specialties in Radiators which will place us still further in the lead, and we shall continue as in the past to produce only high grade and efficient goods.

We are indebted to the Architects for their loyal support and confidence, believing that you favor the best Canadian material.

The success of a large business like ours helps other trades, and encourages our country, and must in turn bring new business to architects whose prosperity should go hand in hand With our own.



We heartily wish you the Season's Compliments and a Happy and Prosperous New Year.
