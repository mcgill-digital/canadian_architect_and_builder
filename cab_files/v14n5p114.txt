LEGAL.



J.	and C. Low, contractors and builders of Ottawa, were defendants in an interesting action, in which judgment bas beets given. Defendants had the contract - to build a summer Cottage on Rabbit Island in the St. Lawrence last summer They sub-let thc contract for plumbing to King & Burnette, of Lansdowne, for $500. The cottage was destroyed by fire when almost completed. Thc sub-contractor sued tile contractors for $488, claiming that amount of work was done when the cottage was destroyed. They wet-c allowed this amount by the Jury at the Brockville Assizes. Chancellor Boyd reserved judgment on a legal point raised by' defendants' counsel. He however, gave judgment in favor of plaintiff



WHERE DOES A BUILDING BEGIN ?—An exceedingly novel point under the Workmen's Compensation Act was raised before Judge Parry at Manchester County Court Christopher M'Grath, while brick setting on a warehouse that was being erected by Messrs. Neill and Sons, was thrown from the second story' to the basement by a plank suddenly tilting up. He therefore claimed damages for injuries sustained. The question at issue was one as to whether the height of the building should be calculated from the street level or from the level of the cellar. It was argued that if the street level were to he taken the 30 feet required by the Act would not be obtained, and the action could not succeed. Judge Parry expressed his opinion that the only way of measuring was to begin at the bottom of the brick, inasmuch as a builder began at the bottom, whether it was above or below the street level. As the point, however, was a very important one, he would reserve his decision.
