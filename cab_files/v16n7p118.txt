NOTES.



In the building of the City Hall of Philadelphia, a portion of the brickwork of the tower was laid up with cement mortar and another portion was laid in lime mortar. The work was faced with marble. As a result, wherever the marble facing was backed with brick in lime mortar, the marble facing crushed and spalled and had to be cut away and refaced. Wherever cement mortar had been used no harm came to the marble facing.
