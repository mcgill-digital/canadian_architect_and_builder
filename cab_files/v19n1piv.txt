At Tacoma,	the tallest concrete chimney ever built the present marvel of engineers the world over

rises to a height of 307 feet 634 inches. This wonderful chimney was built by the Contracting Engineering Company, of Tacoma for a smelter to carry away the deadly fumes developed in the reduction of ores at such height that the vegetation of the locality might not be injured nor the residents in the vicinity annoyed. 

The chief dimensions of the chimney are as follows height, 307 feet 634 inches; foundation, 6½ feet deep, 39'2 feet square ; inside diameter of chimney, 18 feet largest outside diameter, 21 feet. To a height of 90 feet it is built double, the outer shell being 9 inches thick and the inner 4 inches thick, with a 5 inch air space between the two shells. The single shell is 7 inches thick and 211 feet 34 inch high.

The chimney was built in 3 foot sections. The foundation is reinforced by networks of '1' steel r

1 1/4 x 3/16 inches and the chimney part is reinforced by vertical T bars of the same dimensions ranging from 16 to 30 feet in length, and encircled by rings of T steel. All the work was done from the inside of the chimney, a scaffold being raised as the work progressed. Material was hoisted by means of a cable attached to the drum of the engine operating the concrete mixer. After the foundation was in, the construction occupied just fifty working days. The chimney cost $27,600. In its construction 1,225 barrels of cement and 105,000 pounds of T steel were used.
