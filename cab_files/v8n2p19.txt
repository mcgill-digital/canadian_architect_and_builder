Negotiations have been in progress of late between the Brick and Stone Masons' sections of the Toronto Builders' Exchange and delegates from the unions representing the journeymen in these trades, as to what should be the rate of wages on the termination on the first of May of the agreement entered into by the employers and employees five years ago. The employers are understood to be averse to making a new agreement except the rate of wages be reduced to correspond in some measure to the universal depreciation in values. On the other hand they show no disposition to depreciate wages beyond this point. No understanding has yet been reached, but it is entirely probable that the matter will be amicably adjusted, either by the renewal of the agreement, it may be on different terms, or by mutually consenting to do without an agreement. There is no doubt that a satisfactory agreement would be the most advantageous settlement of the matter for all concerned.



THE <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>has decided to hold an exhibition of architectural drawings in connection with the Royal Canadian Academy exhibition, which is to take place in Toronto next May. The Academy have very generously granted the Association the exclusive use of one of their rooms, which in point of light and location is equal to those allotted to paintings. Such a favorable opportunity of exhibiting their work was never presented to the architects of this province at least, and we trust they will not be slow to manifest their appreciation of it. 'A hanging committee, composed of members of the 0. A. A., will be appointed, who will select from the drawings submitted those which by merit would be entitled to a place in the exhibition. No drawing which has previously been exhibited in Toronto will be allowed a place in the exhibition. It is important to the success of the exhibition that the hanging committee' should have in its composition sufficient back-bone to unhesitatingly reject without fear or favor such drawings as fall below the proper standard of merit. It is no less important that those submitting drawings should determine that they will cheerfully bow to the judgment, favorable or otherwise, which the committee shall pass on their work. If these points are strictly observed, we may expect that the approaching exhibition will be one which will be creditable and in every respect advantageous to the profession.



THE greater part of our space in the present number is given to a report of the proceedings of the recent annual convention of the Ontario Association of Architects. Notwithstanding that the number of pages has been increased, the space at our disposal is insufficient to present all the excellent papers read at the convention. Those which we are obliged to hold over will appear in our March number. In point of interest the convention was probably the most successful in the history of the Association  AS regards the attendance, there is still ample room for improvement. Each year serves to emphasize the fact that there is a useful work for the Association to do, principally on the line of the education of future generations of architects. It is to be hoped that there will be manifest on the part of students of architecture a greater appreciation of the self-sacrificing efforts which are being put forth on their behalf by the older members of the profession in the Association. Instead of shirking the
