ARRANGED FOR THE LATITUDE OF TORONTO â€”USING APPARENT TIME.

<doctype type="text;plate">

The above compass is the one exhibited at the annual meeting of thc Ontario Association of Architects by Mr. C. H. C. Wright, and gives the azimuth (direction) of the sun from sunrise to sunset for any day during the Year.



Any architect, by applying a tracing of the plan of any dwelling or building to the compass, can at once determine the amount of sunlight entering through the different windows, and also the exact hours of available sunlight.



A north window is suggested in the diagram, and shows that the sun will shine through such a window on June 21st, from sunrise until nearly six o'clock in the morning, and in the evening from a little past six until sunset. Again on May 3rd or August 9th the opening will admit direct sunlight from sunrise until a



quarter past five, and from a quarter to seven until sunset. After August 18th and until April 25th the sunlight will not enter the window.
