We began the century with the remains of the Classical tradition, but Adam had already "improved" it, as he thought ; Stuart and Revitt had done their work and the Greek fashion was well in the ascendant. Then came Pugin, ardent, fanatical, kill of energy and narrow ideas, a very iconoclast in regard to the old tradition and after him Ruskin, who thought he had found the key to architecture in his personal preferences and the morality of Exeter Hall.
