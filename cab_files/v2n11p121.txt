ORONTO, Hamilton and Woodstock have new city buildings under construction, and the citizens of London are asking themselves the question whether their financial position is not strong enough to warrant them in falling into line in this direction.

HE supply of good architectural draughtsmen in Canada appears to be considerably below the demand. The suggestion has been made that here is a field for which women should be specially well adapted, and which in point of remuneration as well as in other respects would yield a more satisfactory return than many of the occupations in which they are at present engaged.



WE present our subscribers this month with a number which, in point of illustrations at least, is of more than ordinary interest and value. During the last few months we have increased the number of our reading pages and added an extra page of illustrations with each issue. It is our purpose during the coming year, if a continuance of past support is accorded us, to introduce new features which will greatly increase the value of the publication to every reader.

HE London water inspector has been analyzing the water contained in numerous wells in that city from which families draw their supply for domestic use. The result is truly

alarming. Only two wells out of nineteen inspected, contained water which could be described as good. Nine were written down "bad" and "very bad," and two "vile." Surely, as a contemporary remarks, this ought to be sufficient to induce the owners of these disease-breeding holes to fill them up and secure a supply of the wholesome Springbank water.



E are pleased to be informed that an effort is being

 made to establish an Art School in Toronto. The <assoc>Ontario Society of Artists </assoc>have appointed a committee to that end, and the Architectural Guild have done the same. It is proposed that these committees shall work to the same end, and having the support of the two bodies, there is no doubt but that they will be able to perfect a scheme which will give the city a school which will satisfy a great need. There are many so-called art schools in the city, but they teach very little that can in any sense be considered Art.





W E publish in this number the accepted design for the  <building>Confederation Life Association's </building>new building in Toronto ; also the report of Mr. <person>J. W. Hopkins, </person>of Montreal, the expert appointed to judge the plans submitted in competition. Eighteen architects entered the competition, a number of whom are residents of Arnerican cities. It is gratifying to know that three out of the five prizes offered were awarded to Canadian architects, the first position and the carrying out of the work being given to Messrs. <firm>Knox, Elliot & Jarvis</firm>, of Toronto, and third and fourth position to Mr. <person>J. Balfour</person>, of Hamilton, and Mr. <person>Alfred Flockton</person>, of Montreal, respectively. Messrs. <firm>James & James</firm>, of New York, carried off the second prize. We are pleased to be able to state that the Confederation Life Association appears to have taken every precaution to secure an impartial decision. This being the case, however admirable every defeated competitor's design may appear to his own judgment, he will doubtless be willing to accept with good grace the verdict that the preferred designs were better adapted to all the requirements. ____________________

HE placing f electric light and telephone wires underground, which has lately been commenced in Toronto, will in time lead to a great deal of trouble in several directions unless a change in methods is decided upon. At present each company puts down its own conduit. A pursuance of this system will result in a network of underground conduits, the putting down and repairing of which will necessitate continual tearing up of the streets and make it impossible for the city to maintain good roadways. There is little doubt that it will also lead to conflicts involving questions of right and authority between the various companies using the streets. The present is a proper time for the authorities of Canadian cities to consider the whole question of the best method of conducting electricity. If it is decided that the proper place for electric wires is underground, then we believe it will be found cheaper and far more satisfactory in the end, to provide underground subways of sufficient dimensions to accommodate all the electric light and telephone wires that may ever be required to be used. The underground problem must ultimately resolve itself into this therefore by
