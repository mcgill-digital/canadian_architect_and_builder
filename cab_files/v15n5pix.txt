A building is now in course of erection in Birmingham England, that represents some novel features in construction. The

plot has remained unoccupied for many years because the tunnel of the <building>Great Western Railway inns </building>three feet beneath the surface of the ground and will not bear any more weight than is at present upon it, The architect has now planned a building which meets these objections. The building is three stories in height and 25 feet of it will project over the tunnel, carried on huge cantilevers, six in number. A mass of concrete, 16 by 15 feet, and weighing 160 tons, hangs suspended from the other end of the cantilevers as a counterpoise.
