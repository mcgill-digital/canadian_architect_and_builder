Teaching of Architecture at McGill

University.

TO ADVERTISERS.



For the benefit of Advertisers, a copy of this journal is mailed each week to persons mentioned in the CONTRACT RECORD reports as intending to build, with a request to consult our advertisement pages and write advertisers for material, machinery, etc.



IT may be a matter of some interest to our readers to know what legal rights are possessed by persons who may desire to move a building along the public streets from one situation to another. The Supreme Court of New Jersey expressed the opinion that the use of a public highway for such purpose was not within the rights enjoyable by the public in a public highway for the purpose of travel. The Supreme Court of Indiana decided that although citizens had the right to ordinary use of the streets they could not interrupt traffic or discommode the public by tearing down electric wires in order to remove buildings along the streets. In the case of the Toronto Street Railway Company vs. Dollery, it was held that a person cannot lawfully blockade the tracks of a railway company by moving a building.



WE have the pleasure to present in this number a personal sketch and portrait of Professor Capper, who has been

chosen to fill the newly established Chair of Architecture at McGill University, Montreal. Professor Capper was honored by being called upon at the very outset of his career in McGill, to deliver the annual university lecture. It will unquestionably be gratifying to the profession throughout Canada to observe that the teaching of architecture has been given a place side by side with instruction in engineering and the other professions at the foremost seat of learning in the Dominion. A perusal of Professor Capper's address gives the impression that the new Department of Architecture has been entrusted to competent hands, and that at its head is a gentleman inspired by high ideals and a determination to impart as far as possible those ideals to his students and others with whom he may be brought in contact.



ALLUSION was made in our October number to the fact that up to that time the City Council of Montreal had taken

no action with reference to the new building by-law which was drafted and submitted for their approval early in the year by the Province of Quebec Association of Architects. It is gratifying to learn that during the last month representatives of the Association were invited to join the aldermen in considering the matter. We have not learned what progress was achieved, but now that a beginning has been made in the direction of dealing with the subject, we trust that the necessary time will be given for its thorough consideration, and

Proposed new Building By-Law for

Montreal.
