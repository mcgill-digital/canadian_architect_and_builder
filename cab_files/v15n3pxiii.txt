<article title=" COMPLIMENTARY DINNER TO MR. D. B. DICK " author="">COMPLIMENTARY DINNER TO MR. <person>D. B. DICK</person>

On February 27th last the members of the old <assoc>Architectural Guild of Toronto </assoc>dined together in honour of Mr. D. B. Dick upon the occasion of his going away for a long holiday in Europe. As was truly said at the dinner a more extended body of entertainers would better represent Mr. Dick's well-wishers in the profession; but the entertainers on the present occasion were the smaller body of more intimates associates whose relations with Mr. Dick have been personal. Since the days when the Architectural Guild first brought members of the profession together Mr. Dick has been a leading member of the architectural societies listened to with the respect that a right

opinion and a courteous manner always command. But a great source of Mr. Dick's influence has been the knowledge that he has had personally nothing to gain by promoting the objects of <assoc>the Association of Architects</assoc> and nothing to lose if it failed to attain them. He has thus become a type of the ideal member of an association founded for public ends, and has helped much to establish the large minded and public spirited points of view so essential for an association of this kind. We wish Mr. Dick a prosperous holiday and a safe return.





Mr. <person>F. S. Baker</person>, <assoc>F.R.I.B.A.</assoc>., of Toronto, recently registered at the Canadian Government offices in London.
