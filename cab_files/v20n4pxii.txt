CEMENT CONSUMPTION IN CANADA.

The total quantity of Portland cement manufactured in

Canada in 1906 was 2,152,562 barrels, as compared with

1,541,508 barrels in 1905, an increase of 610,994 barrels, or

39.6	per cent. The total sales of Portland cement were 2,119,-

764 barrels, as compared with 1,346,548 barrels in 1905, an

increase of 775,216 barrels, or 57.4 per cent.

Fifteen companies were operating plants during 1906, with a total daily capacity of about 10,500 barrels, namely, onc in Nova Scotia, two in Quebec, eleven in Ontario, and one in British Columbia. At least four plants were under construction during the year, of which the total initial daily capacity will be about 4,700 barrels.

 Detailed statistics of production in	1905 and 1906 are as

follows:—

Value of cement sold	$1,913,740 $3,164,807 Some companies do not take stock at the end of the calendar

year, consequently their estimates of stock on hand (10 not always agree from year to year.

The average price per barrel at the works in 1906 was $1.49, as compared with $1,42 in 1905.

The imports of Portland cement into Canada in 1906 were:—

Six months ending June	945,187	$319,021

Six months ending December	1,485,373	459,685

The year 1906	2,430,760	$778,706

This is equivalent to 694,505 barrels of 360 pounds each at an average price per barrel of $1.12. The duty is 12 1-2 cents per hundred pounds.

The imports in 1905 were equivalent to 917,558 barrels, valued at $1,138,548, or an average price per barrel of $1.24.

There is very little cement exported from Canada. The consumption is therefore practically represented by the Canadian sales, together with the imports.

The following is an estimate of the consumption of Portland cement in Canada for the past six years:—
