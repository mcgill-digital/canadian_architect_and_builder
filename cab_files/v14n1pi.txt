MUIRHEAD'S

METAL WHITE

This article, as its name implies, is a White Metallic Paint, ground in Pure Linseed Oil

IT DOES NOT injure the Linseed Oil as all grades of White Lead do.

IT WILL NOT chalk nor flake off.

IT WILL NOT blacken in an impure atmosphere.

IT HAS greater spreading capacity than any White Lead.

IT IS non-poisonous, being a perfect sanitary paint.

IT IS more easily applied than White Lead.

IT IS unrivalled for painting the inside and outside of houses, farm implements, boats, greenhouses, or anything requiring paint.

BY ACTUAL TEST it has worn six times as long as pure White Lead on a floor—it is equally good for door steps and decks of vessels,

IT MAY be tinted to any shade.

IT IS the most important article introduced for painting in recent years.
