<article title=" NEXT PLACE OF MEETING " author="">

The selection of' the place of meeting for the next convention was then taken up. Motions were offered in favor of Toronto, Kingston and Quebec. A vote was taken, with the result that Toronto was chosen as the meeting place for the second convention, the date to he fixed by the Executive Committee.

Mr. Elliott moved that the thanks be hereby tendered to the press for favors received, especially to Hardware

and Metal, THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, and last, but not the least, to the Plumbers Trade Journal, and the able representatives sent here to assist us.

The President then called upon Lieut. -Col. Massey, of the Gurney-Massey Co., Montreal, to address the meeting.

Mr. Massey I need scarcely assure you all that I did not expect you to call on me to say address you this morning. I should, however, fall very far short of my duty if I did not at once accede to your request. As a Montrealer in business here I can only assure those gentlemen from a distance who have come to assist you in forming a plumbers' association in the Dominion of Canada, that we are exceedingly glad to have you come to our city. I think the object of your association is very commendable. The duties of the Montreal association have been very carefully carried out heretofore. I have always loved to learn, and find that in going from place to place we can always derive a great benefit. I trust you may all have a very pleasant stay in Montreal.

Mr. Elliott moved, seconded by Mr. Burroughes, that the master plumbers of the Dominion desire to tender their sincere thanks to the Montreal Master Plumbers' Association for the hearty manner in which they have been received.

The motion was carried amid applause.
