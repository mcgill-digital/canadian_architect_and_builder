CANADA is the scene of some of the greatest engineering triumphs. It is therefore not surprising to learn that an official of the <firm>Russian Railway Department </firm>visited Ottawa recently by direction of the Czar, with the object of obtaining information touching the best practice in bridge construction.



THE amendments which were suggested by the <assoc>Master Plumbers1 Association </assoc>to the Toronto plumbing by-law, cannot be Incorporated into the by-law at the present time, owing to a recent decision given by <person>Judge McDougall </person>in the Toronto Courts. This decision is to the effect that the City Council has no authority to regulate the size and weight of pipe which shall be used in the plumbing system of a building. In view of this decision, it is understood to be the intention of the City Council of Toronto to make application to the Ontario Legislature at its next Session for authority which will enable a by-law to be passed to govern the manner in which plumbing shall be done.



WE regret to have to record the death on the last day of July, of Mr. <person>Richard M. Hunt, </person>tile distinguished American architect. Mr. hunt held the foremost place among tile architects of the United States, and was the recipient of high honors front foreign societies. His art training was received at the School of Fine Arts in Paris, and for a time he practiced his profession in that city. He afterward returned to America and opened offices in New York city. In New York, Boston and Newport are to he seen many examples of his skill. He was the designer of tile Administration Building at the World's Fair. He more than once Occupied the position of President of the <assoc>American Institute of Architects</assoc>, was a corresponding member of the Institute of France, and the recipient quite recently of the Royal Gold Medal of the Royal Institute of British Architects.



IT is reported that in Duluth, recently, lumber dealers threatened to boycott any builder or architect who should specify Washington fir in any public buildings. The purpose, doubtless, was to make it necessary that home timber should be used. So far as lumber is concerned, it is almost impossible to talk of excluding any particular class of lumber from any particular district or country. No article of merchandise is so thoroughly cosmopolitan in its character as lumber, and the trade is becoming more so every year. Washington fir, or what is known in this country as the Douglas fir of British Columbia, is especially suited for certain work, and the world over, those who want the best lumber for shipbuilding, and in other cases where great strength and endurance are required, will be obliged to secure Douglas fir. In the Transactions of American Civil Engineers is published tile following tests of woods : White pine broke at 3,872 pounds, all same sizes. Norway pine broke at 4,oo8 pounds all same sizes. Douglas fir broke at 6,214 pounds, all same sizes. In other words Douglas fir was shown to be by a large percentage Stronger than the strongest woods. This wood is becoming well known lately in its uses for bridges and other public undertakings. Some unusually large pieces have been sent east to Montreal to be used for dredger work there.
