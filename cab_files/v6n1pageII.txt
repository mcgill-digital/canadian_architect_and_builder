CHIEF ARCHITECT'S OFFICE, OTTAWA, August 1st, 1889.



FRENCH FORT SAND-STONE.

DIAR SIR, - The new Departmental Building in this city has been built of this stone — upwards of 12,000 cubic feet having been used.

Having inspected the quarries, I am able to state that it is almost unlimited in extent, and blocks of almost any size can readily be obtained; it is of a most pleasing colour, which seems to improve with age, very easily wrought, and in that respect alone has the advantage of most of the sand-atones at present in use. The stone was wrought and placed in this building quite green from the quarry. and notwithstanding that the variations in temperature during the past severe winters have been from

		2040 degrees in twenty four hours, it has not been	in any way impaired.

	<person>C. E. Fish</person>, Esq., N. B.		I am, Dear Sir, yours truly,

	Newcastle,	<person>THOS. FULLER</person>, Chief Architect.
