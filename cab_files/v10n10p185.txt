ARTISTS are being invited by the Secretary Statues for

Parliament Hill.	of State to submit designs and models for statues of Her Majesty the



Queen and the late Hon. Alexander Mackenzie. The statues are to be placed within the Parliament grounds at Ottawa; that of the Queen is to be located on the terrace directly in front of the buildings. The location of thc other statue has not yet been chosen. This should have been one of the preliminary steps in the undertaking, so that designs might have been adapted to the surroundings. The sum of $5,000 has been appropriated for each statue, an amount altogether inadequate for the purpose. Twenty thousand dollars would be a sufficiently moderate figure for a statue of the Queen to occupy such a conspicuous position. It is gratifying to note that the competition is restricted to Canadian artists. It is to be hoped that the preference thus given to native talent will not be offset by the expenditure being limited to a figure which will not allow the competitors scope for their abilities.



ARCHITECTS who may not wish to have The London Hospital their trouble for their pains would do

Competition.

well to look carefully into the conditions before entering the competition for plans for the proposed hospital building at London, Ont, In the printed instructions to architects, the committee in charge state that the competition will be decided by an expert appointed by the Ontario Association of Architects. On inquiry we learn that the 0. A.A. have never been consulted with regard to the matter, consequently the statement referred to is totally unauthorized. We presume the Association will call the promoters of the competition to account for this unwarranted use of its name. In addition to this there are other peculiar features of the competition. Architects were originally given to understand that while the committee did not desire to pay an architect's fees for superintendence, they were prepared to pay the usual fees for preparation of drawings. At a later stage, however, the announcement was made that a lump sum of $500 would be paid to the winner of the competition for his drawings. This sum is less than one and one-half per cent. of the estimated cost of the buildings. The whole affair has the appearance of being arranged to admit of the work being given to some favorite architect, who, in conjunction with the committee, would at small cost reap the advantage of the ideas evolved by all the competitors.
