NOTES.

The method has been adopted in the United States in the case of certain classes of difficult undertakings of building with profits in the form of a commission on labor and materials. A firm of New York contractors who agreed to erect a large stone building at the actual cost of materials and labor plus 8 per cent. commission, binding themselves to the employer that the total cost including their commission and architects' fees, should not

exceed 20 cents per foot, are now bringing suit in the courts to

determine a dispute as to what is due them.
