<article title=" SANDSTONE DEPOSITS " author="">SANDSTONE DEPOSITS.

Sandstone deposits have been located on the Upper Saskatchewan River by <person>J. McK.. Dickson</person>, of Edmontion, that will prove of incalculable value to Edmonton builders. The stone was located after two years of most persistent and searching prospecting. The find was thoroughly tested, the claims surveyed by Mr. Driscoll, D.L.S, and the quarries are now ready for working The supply is unlimited. Mr. Dickson states that there are millions of tons of the purest blue-grey sandstone, in beds from forty to one hundred and eighty feet deep. There is not over three feet of earth on the beds and the quarries can be economically worked. The sandstone is superior, architects and builders claim, to any Western stone that has yet been quarried. When taken from the quarry the stone is

soft, a knife cutting it easily. Exposed to the air, this wonderful combination of silicate and lime hardens to flint, and assumes a blue-grey color that is the admiration of builders.
