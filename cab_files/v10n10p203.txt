THE margin of safety demanded in elevators is, naturally, very generous, and there are various forms of safety clutches, many of them automatic in their action, but

experience goes to show that none of these can be a full substitute for the air cushion in the pit. The action of this device in insuring safety is almost magical. In some experiments made in a lofty store in New York, the lift was taken to the top of the building and allowed to fall with the brake off. A writer in "Scribners Monthly" says it fell to the top of the pit with tremendous force, and struck the cushion of air with a sound as if it had struck soft earth. It seemed to stop suddenly at the top of the pit and then slowly settled down to the bottom. It was clear that the pit was too small at the top; that the slope of the sides was too slight that if the escape of air had been freer at the impact the stopping would have been sensibly gradual. The stop was really gradual, as was shown by the fact that a half-dozen eggs in a paper bag, that had been laid on the elevator floor, survived the fall without injury. As a reserve against any possible failure of the other safety appliances, this seems an expedient worthy of imitation. Its presence

would conduce to a feeling of perfect security on the part of timid people who have sometimes to use these elevators.
