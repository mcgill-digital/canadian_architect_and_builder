<assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB

</assoc>ON Tuesday, December 23rd, a paper on " Plastering," was read before the club by Mr. <person>J. M. Gander</person>, which lead to an interesting discussion on limes and cements at the close, nearly all present taking part. A synopsis of the paper will be found on another page. Before Mr. Gander commenced, the members examined, with interest, a collection of architectural photographs belonging to Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, which be had kindly brought to the Club for that purpose.

The attendance at this meeting was not quite so large as usual, but this was no doubt due to the nearness of the Christmas holidays.

At the meeting held on January 13th, Mr. <person>Joseph Yorke </person>gave a very instructive lecture entitled "Stone its Qualities and Uses," which be illustrated by samples of the various building stones used in Toronto, and the tools for working them, thus bringing the subject very clearly before his audience. Mr. Yorke received an enthusiastic vote of thanks for his trouble.

-In introducing the lecturer the Chairman, Mr. <person>A. H. Gregg</person>, made some very pertinent remarks on the subject from the aesthetic point of view.

Mr. T. R. Johnson was elected a member of the Executive Committee to take the place of Mr. <person>A. R. Mead</person>, who is away from the city.

At the next meeting, on Tuesday, 27th inst., a paper on "Building Materials," will be given by Mr. <person>H. B. Gordon</person>, which promises to be very interesting. The competitive drawings for a window will also be on exhibition, and criticised by Mr. <person>Frank Darling</person>.



<article title=" THE POINTED OR ENGLISH STYLE OF ARCHITECTURE " author="H.B.">.

By 



THE pointed style of architecture is a graceful subject of investigation. Its importance with the architect is so great and obvious that it would scarcely be necessary to advert to it if we did not perceive the neglect with which it is treated, or the mistaken view with which it is contemplated, through the medium of those incongruous fabrics which are too often raised in modern days and are nominally attributed by their builders to this style.

Notwithstanding the virulence and declamation of those who were engaged in reviving Grecian architecture, the pointed mode remains the great boast of English art. Its origin may be disputed; the powerful rivalry of a neighboring country may not be denied; but no cavils of fastidious writers have succeeded in showing the prototype of our great national instances of excellence in this style. This mode of architecture was undoubtedly the pride of our ancestry—the favorite child of art on which they lavished indulgence— and the structures erected in this style are equally the pride of the existing period; since in the assemblage of their several perfections they present the single surprising instance in which the middle ages were enabled to produce an excellence in the ornamental aids, independent of all imitation, of the sublime simplicity of Greece and Rome.

The term Gothic was first bestowed on some species of ecclesiastical architecture, as an epithet of obloquy, and was intended to signify its supposed barbarous deviation from the Grecian or Roman modes—not to imply its deviation from the Goths, who, in fact, possessed no national mode of architecture, and when in Italy profited by Italian artists. it is much wished that the word Gothic should not be used in speaking of the architecture of England, from the thirteenth to the sixteenth century. The term tends to give false ideas on the subject, and originated with the Italian writers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, who applied the expression of " <building>La Maniera Gotica </building>in contempt to all the works of art of the middle ages.

From these writers it was borrowed by Sir <person>Christopher Wren</person>, the first English writer who has applied it to English architecture. There is very little doubt that the light and elegant style of building, whose characteristic feature is the high pointed arch struck from the centres, was invented in this country; it is certain that it was here brought to its highest state of perfection, and the testimonies of other countries, whose national traditions ascribe their most beautiful churches to English artists, adds great weight to this assertion, and peculiar propriety to the term English, now proposed to be substituted for the word Gothic.

The architecture used by the Saxons is very properly called Saxon. The improvements introduced after the Norman conquest, justify the application of Norman to the edifices of that period. The nation assumed a new character about the time of Henry the II. The language. properly  English, was then formed, and an architecture founded on the Norman and Saxon, but extremely different from both, was invented by English artists ; it is surely equally just and proper to distinguish this style by the honorable appellation of' English.

In this they essentially differ from the Roman's way, who laid all their mouldings horizontally, which made the best perspective; the Gothic way on the contrary carried all their mouldings on the perpendicular; so that the ground work being settled, they had nothing else to do but to spire all up as they could, Thus they made their pillars into a bundle of toruses, which divided into more when they came to the roof; and then these toruses split into many small ones, and, traversing one another, gave occasion to the tracery work.

Sir Christopher Wren indicates that the practice of the pointed style of architecture, exclusively appertained to the fraternity of <assoc>Free Masons</assoc>, who were stimulated to exertion by the indulgences granted by the Pope, and styled themselves Free and Accepted Masons, and ranged from one nation to another as they found churches to build (for very many in those ages were in building, through piety or emulation). Every tenth man was called a warden and overlooked each nine. Sir <person>James Hall</person>, Bart., the ingenious antiquary, referring to those principles whence all the works of true genius take their data, observes that the combination of art with that of nature, of which we see the most perfect example in the Corinthian capital, produces what are called architectonic forms in which the variety of nature being subjected to the regularity of art, the work acquires that peculiar character, which in a natural object, or in its entire representation we consider  offensive under the  name of formality, but which, in architecture, we admire as a beauty, under the name of symmetry. Occupied with this point of the probable origin of the pointed style, in whatever district of the globe the invention might have occurred, he was accidentally induced to attribute it to an imitation of small simple buildings, composed of willow rods. He worked experimentally on his new idea and found that, front on artificial combination of such rods, united with the effect produced upon them by time and the course of nature, even the most intricate forms of this elaborate style might be reduced, in the view of a theorist, to the simplicity of their original state.

A casual thought, incidentally conceived, and expressed without a view to its consequences, but which tends towards the same speculation, occurs in the following words of Grose: A number of boughs, stuck into the ground opposite to each other, and tied together at the top in order to form a bower, exactly describe the pointed arch." Searching in history for support of his theory, Sir James Hall notices several early religious buildings, which are expressly said to have been made of rods. Such was the first little church of Durham, and the celebrated old church of Gastonberg. Sir <person>James Hall</person> has sufficiently profited by his historical aid, in stating it as being likely that a pious posterity would endeavor to preserve the peculiar form of such churches, by representing them in stone ; and this attempt when carried into execution, being found to produce a beautiful effect, it is not unreasonable to suppose that the idea should become a favorite one, being followed out by successful refinements, might give birth to a new style of architecture.

Mr. <person>Hawkins</person> contends that in every Gothic cathedral as yet known the extent from north to south of the two transepts, including the width of the choir if divided into ten, as <person>Vitruvius</person> directs, would exactly give the distribution of the whole. Three arches form the north, and three the south transept; the other four give the breadth from one transept to the other, one division of the four being taken for each of the side aisles of the nave, and two left for its centre walk, the complete distribution of the nave is also given.

Whilst noticing the relative proportions of buildings in this style of architecture, it may be desirable to cite the following remark of <person>Brown Willis</person>, although unconnected with any presumed similitude of arrangement between the works of Grecian and ancient English architects: "In most of the stately abbeys, the height was equal to the breadth of the body and side-aisles. The steeple and towers were equal in height to the length of the whole fabric ; or rather the cross aisle from north to south, as is the case in Bristol, Chester and St. Davids. The cross aisles often extended half the length of the whole fabric, as did the nave or western part, viz., from the great door at the west end to the lower great pillars that supported the steeple. And the side-aisles were just half the breadth and height of the nave, insomuch that both added together exactly answered it.

Mr. Warton divides the pointed style into three classes, which be thus denominates :—The Absolute Gothic, which began with ramified windows of an enlarged dimension, divided into several lights, and branches out at the top into a multiplicity of whimsical shapes and compartments, after the year 1300. Of this fashion be considers the body of <building>Winchester Cathedral </building>to afford a just idea; the Ornamental Gothic, of which he names for example the choir of <building>St. Mary's Church </building>at Warwick; the roof of the <building>Divinity School at Oxford</building>; and the <building>Chapel of King's College</building>, Cambridge; the <building>Florid Gothic</building>, of which the Chapel of St. George, at Windsor, and the Chapel of Henry the VII, at Westminster, are conspicuous specimens.

Mr. <person>Britton</person>, in the judicious ' Sketch of a Nomenclature of Ancient Architecture," thus designates them to their respective dates, viz. : English, from 1189 to 1272, embracing the reigns of Richard I, John, and Henry III; Decorated English, from 1272 to 1461, including the reigns of Edward the 1, 11, and III, Richard the II, and Henry the IV, V, and VI; Highly Decorated or Florid English, from 1461 to 1509 including the reigns of Edward the IV and V, Richard the III, and Henry the VII. " From this era," observes Mr. Britton, "we lose sight of all style and congruity "; and public buildings erected during the reigns of Henry the VIII, Elizabeth and James the I, may be characterized by the term of Debased English or Anglo-Italian.

Dr<person>. Milner </person>describes them thus .—The First Order, that of the acute arch, he considers to have been perfected before the end of the twelfth century, and to have continued till near the close of the thirteenth century. Example, interior of the east end of <building>Canterbury Cathedral</building>. The Second Order, he terms that of the perfect or equivalent arch, but adds for an example, the interior of <building>York Minster</building>. Be states this order as prevailing from the disuse of the former till after the middle of the fifteenth century
