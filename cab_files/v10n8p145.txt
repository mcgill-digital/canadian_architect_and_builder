TO ADVERTISERS.



For the benefit of Advertisers, a copy of this Journal is mailed each week to persons mentioned in the CONTRACT RECORD reports as intending to build, with a request to consult our advertisement pages and write advertisers for material, machinery, etc.







THE rate at which brick for pavements is growing in favor in Toronto can be gauged by the fact that the local paving

brick factory is unable to keep up with the demand. In consequence, the construction of brick pavements is at present at a standstill. It is understood that the manufacturers are taking steps to greatly increase the capacity of their works. If other cities and towns, following the example of Toronto, should adopt brick as a paving material, as doubtless they will, there will be room in Canada for several paving brick manufactories.



THE Mayor of Toronto has recently announced the terms upon which additional park lands can be procured in

the north-west and north-east sections of the city. Except in one instance, these terms would appear to be advantageous. The one exception is the offer by Mr. Manning of land on Palmerston avenue. A park in this locality is no doubt desirable, but not at the price of $5,000 per year for the land alone, to which must be added the cost of tree planting, fencing and other improvements. If such an expenditure is contemplated, it might with much greater advantage be made on the purchase and improvement of the proposed Victoria Square, at Queen and Bay streets, opposite the new city hall. A square in the heart of the business district is certainly the city's greatest need in the way of extended park area.



AMONG the many public improvements which are being undertaken and carried out in Toronto at present, none are

more urgently necessary than public baths. Many years ago Mr. Erastus Wiman erected, at the eastern extremity of Toronto Island, public bath houses, which he presented to the city. For some reason, probably the inconvenience and expense of getting to that part of the Island at that period, these baths after a time fell Into disuse. Since then the Island has been made a very attractive resort, and the facilities for transport to and from the city greatly improved. There is no doubt whatever that if public bath houses were now to be erected and properly maintained on the Island, they would be largely used, especially by the poorer classes. In Great Britain these institutions are made self-supporting, and under proper management they would no doubt in a short time become so here. A very slight fee so small as not to be in any degree prohibitory would
