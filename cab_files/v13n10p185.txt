<article title="Tower Fire Escapes for Schools" author="">THE Board of Education of Philadelphia recently resolved by a unanimous vote that all new school buildings shall

be provided with stone, brick or iron tower fire escapes. Tower escapes are adjudged to be in every way superior to the old style outside fire escape, and can be used in connection with the fire drill.



There has been no falling off in volume of building operations in Toronto, in comparison with 1899, notwithstanding

the increased cost of materials, although no doubt the rise in prices of the tatter was the means of retarding many enterprises which otherwise might have gone forward. At the close of the halt year the value of permits granted was greater than for the like period of 1899. The population of the city has considerably increased during the year. Vacant houses have in consequence filled up rapidly, and there is now a great scarcity of houses at a moderate rental. Rents of houses of this class have advanced about twenty-five per cent. It would appear that an era of house building must shortly begin. Let us hope that the opportunity thus offered for improvement in design and construction will not be lost, even upon the speculative builder. The fact should be borne in mind by every person who puts up a building that it is possible at little or no extra cost above that of the most commonplace structure to use materials in a manner that shall secure a pleasing result, and not violate the canons of good taste. How many ugly buildings do we see in which the best and most costly materials have been employed, but without knowledge or skill ? What a constant waste there is of money and
