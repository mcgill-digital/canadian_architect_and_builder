<doctype type="text">three to one by contractors who are non-members, it is a foregone conclusion that any attempt to force the majority to comply with the will of the minority, must prove abortive, It is manifestly desirable, if not absolutely necessary, that a strong master builders' organization should be maintained. Without such organization, the master builders cannot hope to hold their ground against the demands of the unions. The latter are perfectly organized, and being in affiliation with the International Unions of the United States, are in a good position to enforce their claims. The recent strike in this city fully illustrated this, and also the fact that organization can only be successfully met by organization. So long as the master builders neglect to make use of the weapon which the workmen have used to such good advantage, they will lose ground in every conflict. It is not desirable that the struggles of the past between employer and employee should be perpetuated. On the contrary, it is believed that if the employers possessed an organization as perfect as that of the workmen, it would be a potent influence for the settlement of disputes without recourse to strikes, which under such circumstances would be certain to be of a very protracted character, and much more likely than at present to result in favor of the employers. It is a significant fact that for many years past the peace of Europe has resulted from what is termed an "armed neutrality." So it would be in the adjustment of labor disputes. The desire has many times been heard expressed for the formation of a Builders' and Contractors' Association for the Province of Ontario, The <assoc>Toronto Federated Builders' Association </assoc>should seek to bring all the reputable contractors of the city into its membership—not by coercive measures but by appeals to their intelligence and self-interest— and thus form the nucleus of a Provincial organization.



<article title="The Advantages (?) of employing an American Architect" author="Ives, H.R.">THE ADVANTAGES (?) OF EMPLOYING AN AMERICAN

ARCHITECT.

MONTREAL, July 12, 1890.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—During the recent political contest in Ontario, the name of a Buffalo architect was used very freely, and our own name was also quoted in this connection without our consent. At the same time, the facts which were brought forward against <person>Mr. Waite </person>as favoring Americans at the expense of Canadians were correct, and without any desire to injure Mr. Waite, we think it is only right that Canadian manufacturers and contractors should know how we have been treated by him in several cases, and to be able to avoid being put to the same trouble and expense for nothing as we have been.

The first instance of this was in connection with tendering for the iron work of the <building>Bank of Commerce MOntreal</building>. In this case we were led to believe that our tender would be accepted, provided we could do the work in a certain time. We named ten weeks as the time in which we would complete the work, but upon the pretext "that this was not soon enough," the work was given to a Buffalo firm who promised to do it a few days sooner, but they took a very much longer time to do the work than was agreed upon, or than we had offered to do it, and we have been informed that in place of nine weeks they were nearer six months before the work was entirely completed. We enclose herewith an article from the Trade Bulletin showing how we were treated in the matter of the <building>Canada Life building </building>with comments by the editor.

Before sending in our tender for the <building>Canada Life building</building>, we got a letter from the manager of the Imperial Insurance Co. here, stating that we had recently completed iron work for their building in this city to the extent of some twenty-three thousand dollars, and that we had done our work in the best manner and promptly. This letter we forwarded to Mr. Waite, although after our thirty years experience in this country with this class of work, it should not have been necessary. The work was to have been completed by the first of July ; you can easily ascertain in what state it is at present time.

Since the above we have another grievance, in which we were thrown out of a job on the same pretext, "that the time which we set for the delivery of the work was too long," although we had been asking for particulars of the job for at least four months

previously. We have a letter from the parties to say that "they had been obliged to order the work in the States at a higher price in consequence of the architect considering that the time set was not short enough." Of course, this must directly or indirectly come out of the pockets of proprietors.

We are, yours very truly,

<firm>H.R. IVES & Co</firm>.

<article title="Still another Competition" author="">STILL ANOTHER COMPETITION.

 "FROM bad to worse" correctly describes the condition of  architectural competitions in this country. In proof

whereof, witness the following circular sent out for the information and guidance of certain architects by the <assoc>St. George's Society </assoc>of Toronto: "A Company has been organized from members of St. George's Society, called the St. George's Hall Company, for the purpose of constructing a <building>St. George's Hall  Toronto</building>on a lot on Elm St., 50 feet frontage, by 117 feet deep, the property of St. George's Society. The cost of the building is not to exceed from $13,000 to $14,000. The requirements for the special use of the Society in the building are as follows :—A committee room, two ante-rooms for applicants, four rooms for secretary's dwelling, and a hall as commodious as the ground will permit, certainly not less than 65 x 35 feet. For renting or revenue purposes, lodge rooms in the upper flat and such other arrangements as are most likely to be available and advantageous, are required, and I am instructed to invite you (though upon the express conditions that the Directors do not bind themselves to accept, or pay for, yours, or any other plans furnished) to furnish plans for the proposed building, together with an outside estimate of the total cost, not later than the 1st August next." To quote the words of the circular, the "advantageous arrangements" are all on the side of the Society; almost the only definite information given the architect is contained in the familiar clause freeing the Society from any obligation to accept or pay for any of the designs which maybe sent in. Let the response on the part of architects invited to enter this competition be as liberal as the remuneration offered for their services.



<article title="the Ontario Architects' Act" author="">THE ONTARIO ARCHITECTS' ACT.

W

E publish, in full, in this number the bill which the architects of Ontario have succeeded in getting through the Provincial Legislature. While we congratulate our professional brethren over the line on their success in winning legislative recognition, and must award them the palm because they have succeeded where we have failed, yet we frankly confess that the "Ontario Architects' Act" is a disappointment. We doubt if any legislature in these United States would pass such a bill, and sincerely hope they would not. A state has undoubtedly the right to guard its citizens against incompetent practitioners, and the State of Minnesota has already done so in regard to the medical profession, but we hardly think a state has a right to delegate its authority to a private corporation. We do not see anything in the act to prevent a non-registered architect practising his profession ; in this country there would
