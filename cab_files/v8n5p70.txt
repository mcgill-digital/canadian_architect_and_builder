THE <building>ONTARIO LEGISLATIVE BUILDING</building>



THE Gazette of this city recently contained the following :—The Complaint is made that the aeousties of the new Ontario Legislative charnber at Toronto, are so bad that the members cannot hear each other across the floor, and visitors in the gallery might as well be at a pantomime. Public opinion is divided as to whether the architect is a blunderer or an unconscious philanthropist. If all legislative chambers were arranged on like principles the members might give up talking, do nothing but work, and save both the ears and the purses of their countrymen.

COUNCIL OF ART AND MANUFACTURES OF THE



PROVINCE OF QUEBEC



On Tuesday, the 3oth inst., took place the official closing and distribution of prizes to the students of the evening classes of the Art and Manufactures School, with whose work the readers of the CANADIAN ARCHITECTS AND BUILDER are already familiar, this institution having been the subject of my monthly correspondence in your November issue. The meeting was held in the Monument National on St. Lawrence street, in the same building as are now located the classes themselves, the accommodation at the old St. Gabriel street school having been found inadequate for the ever-increasing number of students.

There was a large and enthusiastic assemblage presided over by the President of the Council, Mr. <person>L. I. Boivin, </person>accompanied on the platform by the Vice-President, Mr. <person>J. C. Wilson </person>and. Messrs. <person>l. Judge Jette</person>, Hon. <person>Joseph Royal, </person><person>Ex-Ald. Clendinneng, </person><person>J. W. Hughes </person>and others. The President opened the meeting by reading an address containing an historical sketch of the Council from its foundation up to the present date, accompanied by a most convincing proof of the great good conferred by the institution on apprentices in the several branches of the industries, and artist students, in giving them preliminary instruction in the great principles of art, and also treating of the greater good which must result in the future, to individuals, students and the country at large. The address was in substance as follows:

"Ladies and Gentlemen I seize this opportunity afforded me by this distribution of prizes to the pupils of the night schools under the patronage of the Council of Arts, to say a few words as to the object the Government of this Province had in view in establishing that Council.

"On the 24th Dec., 1872 the act passed which legally constituted this Council to replace the old Board of Arts and Manufactures. The object of the Council, like that of the Board, its predecessor, is to advise the Commissioner of Agriculture and Civilization, and time Department of Public Instruction, as to all measures of a nature to develop the progress of Arts and Manufactures in this Province. Now that twenty-two years have elapsed since that period, when I recall to mind those who formed part of the first Council, it is impossible for me not to admire the wisdom which presided at the selection the clergy, the liberal professions, journalism, trade and industry, were all represented.

It is a generally admitted fact that the population of this Province have a natural talent and aptitude for handicraft, and especially for working in wood, iron and stone. There is probably not a single village which does not contain several youths who have a really remarkable talent for drawing. Unfortunately this talent remains unknown and undeveloped through want of that technical education which we endeavor to give in our schools. It is very important that before learning a trade the workman should be able to trace on paper the model of what he wants to do, for drawing is the soul of all technical education. Once he knows how to draw he will easily understand and execute his work in wood or iron. If any article is made in accordance with the rules of drawing and geometry, it will not only be solid and useful, but will also have the elegance which will make it preferable to the purchaser. Take, for instance, the dress goods sold in our shops. Select two pieces of the same weight and quality; there is no difference in the use for which both are intended. How is it, therefore, that one sells for 25 per cent. more than the other? The reason is very simple the pattern or design of one is the work of a man who is educated in the art of his trade; a workman who. daring his apprenticeship, was not afraid to come and spend three evenings a week learning drawing, developing his intelligence and thereby securing for the future Wages sometimes thrice as high as his companions, as intelligent and capable physically as himself—with this difference, however, that they neglected to learn while young. Examples might be multiplied indefinitely, but this one is sufficiently striking to convey may meaning.

"But, ladies and gentlemen, there is another and much higher consideration, which alone would suffice as a reason for the existence of these schools, and amply reward those who make sacrifices for their development. Man by nature loves and constantly seeks the beautiful. By developing this faculty he admires still more the handiwork of the Creator in all his surroundings. When he traces on paper a mountain, a river, a pure and cloudless sky, he sees everywhere the hand of the Great Master of all things. his soul rises higher and higher, his intelligence develops itself more rapidly, and the sense of beauty which he acquires will, without effort, inspire in him a sense of right. Thc workman, with the education suited to his trade, will not only always command better wages, but, from the fact of his intelligence being more fully developed, he will be a steadier workman. His cottage, however modest it may be, will be a model of cleanliness and taste. Thrift will reign in his home, because he will not have contracted bad habits in his youth, but it is in his great respect for the laws of his country that the State will reap its reward for thc sacrifices it has made in educating the working man.

"Such, ladies and gentlemen, are some of the results which we have endeavored and are still endeavoring to obtain by further developing these working-man schools placed under our control. In looking over what has been done in twenty years, I was myself surprised at the great number of pupils who have been through our classes. I have made a summary of the attendance books of our various schools, and I find that, from 1872 to 1894, twenty-three thousand five hundred and seventy-five pupils have attended our classes. These classes are in Montreal, Quebec, Three Rivers, Sorel, Levis, St. Hyacinthe, St. Romuald, Sherbrooke, Huntingdon, St. Jerome, Granby, Chicoutimi, Farnham, Sillery, and for some years at Iberville. The Government of this Province has expended $185,200 in twenty-two years for the maintenance of these schools, say about $7.85 per pupil, making 35 1/2c. per head per annum.

I fancy I hear many of you asking of what use has this instruction been. What has become of the pupils who have passed through your schools during twenty-two years? The report of our Secretary for 1893 to the honorable Commissioner of Agriculture, gives the answer to these questions. This report contains the names and occupations of 550 of our former pupils, who all fill important positions, either on their own account or as foremen in industrial establishments. Several of them are now in Paris or Rome continuing their studies. however, the number of those who owe their success to the instruction they have received in our schools is much larger, but you understand how difficult it is for us to discover their whereabouts. This, ladies and gentlemen,
