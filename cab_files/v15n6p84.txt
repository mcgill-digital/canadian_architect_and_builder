<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER

I cannot make mention of every interesting work as the catalogue, which by the by was rather late in making its bow, contained so much that was admirable. I can only make reference to some of those numbers which appealed most strongly to my Messrs. <firm>Bailey & Truscott</firm>, Philadelphia, sent a fine collection of photos of executed work, a quaint "Colonial" Exterior, No II and a quiet gabled house with half timbered upper stories, No. 22,being particularly attractive.

It is difficult to judge sculpture from rather small photographs in which both scale and technique are almost lost, but the " Stitch" (in clay ?) of Commodore <firm>Bainbridge & Stewart</firm>, No. 124, seemed to give promise of much greater interest than the other work shown by H. K. Bush Brown (Newburg, N. Y.), though the group, ''Indian Buffalo hunt," No. 122, shows life and spirit.

Messrs. Cope & Stewartson, Philadelphia, contributed a round dozen of fine photos, every one representing work worthy of their reputation No. 155, "Entrance to House at Edgehill," is simply exquisite, and No. 157" Dormitories, <building>University of Pennsylvania</building>, from theTerrace,"is a tine piece of transplanted English collegiate building.

Of <person>Nicola D'Asanzo</person>'s decorative designs, No. 171, "Ball Room Decoration for <person>W. W. Gibbs</person>, Esq.,"is a singularly fine composition. The remainder probably depend largely upon the scheme of co'or which is of course lost in the photos. "Egypt Awakening," No. 190, <person>F.F. Elwell</person>, is in my opinion far ahead of all the other exhibits of sculpture.

No. 212, " <building>Dining Room, Codmore, Hyland</building>,"

(11.	<person>G. M. Gordon</person>) and Nos. 55 and 56, "Dining Room" by <building><person>A. H. Brokie</person>, Philadelpha</building>, are specially quiet and reserved.

Nos. 236 to 242 is a series of enlargements admirable in light and shade and peculiarly interesting as illustrative of the American Garden.

"Pantry Fittings," by Messrs. <firm>Kennedy & Kelsey</firm>, of Philadelphia, is a wonderful little bit of skillful contrivance, and the photo of a Mantel, probably in the same house as the <building>Crystal Palace </building>of a Pantry, is as refined as it is effective.

A good collection of photos of Port Sunlight, lent by <firm>Sproatt & Rolph</firm>, Toronto, indicate the happy result of several architects all working on similar lines and in sympathetic accord.

No. 295,' '<building>Bachelor Apartments</building>,"<person>F. M. Mann</person>, with an oak hall kindly rendered by both architect and photographer.

Nos. 298 to 299, <firm>Mewman, Westman & Harris</firm>, Philadelphia, seemed to me to be the softest and most beautiful photos in the collection, the play of light and shade about the picturesque half timbered house in the trees being quite charming. For the furniture I can find little good to say. Nos. 317 to 320, <person>C. Rholfs</person>, Buffalo, appears to me to confound subtle simplicity and direct carpentry with sheer affectation and then smothers the unfortunate result with surface ornament, which is not bad in itself but so shockingly ill applied. Some designs of furniture seem to abhor a plain surface even of very beautiful material.

<person>H. W. Weller</person>, Montreal, sends Nos. 405 and 406, "Some Typical English Beauty Spots."

Judging from the bronze work, Nos. 411 to 417,

by <person>John Williams</person>, New York, it would seem that funds are not doled out to the architect in the United States in the 10 cents at a time measure that is too commonly the case in Canada ; but it is this very point which emphasizes the great difference between United States and Canadian Architecture. The Toronto architect has to exercise a degree of self restraint that his confrere across the border seems to wot not of. Rarely indeed can the Canadian architect let himself go because he has so commonly to solve problems involving the greatest possible return for the minimum outlay, and in Toronto the result is for the most part extremely gratifying, as may be seen by referring to the numerous exhibits of work by the President, which illustrates most aptly how a simple and dignified effect may be gained entirely by means of good lines, careful grouping and clever fenestration ; all the detail being thought out and applied with a sparing and subtle hand.

This self command is evident in much of the work of other exhibitors, and the English influence is also very marked in Messrs. <firm>Burke & Horwood</firm>'s lovely little <building>Bible Training School</building>. And the garden front to "<building>Castle Frank</building>" and the Stables by the same gentlemen are delightful

No. 368 to 376,"<building>House in Queen's Park</building>,"by Messrs. <firm>Sproatt & Rolph</firm>, further illustrates the growing grip that the English influence is taking on Toronto Messrs<firm>Lever Bros.</firm>. premises by the same authors emphasizes this fact very successfully

Nos. 378 to 381 are exceptionally good pen and ink perspectives of <firm>Symons & Rae</firm>'s new <building>University Buildings at Kingston</building>,.

No. 144 is perhaps the most pleasing example given of <firm>Chadwick & Beckett</firm>'s work <person>E. J. Lennox </person>is represented by some very fine enlargements of photos of his well-known work in the city.

No. 444,"<building>An Artist's House</building>," II. Payette, Montreal, is a pretty French villa such as one sees at Strasburg, for instance.

The impression received from' this exhibition is that the influence of the French school is but little felt in Toronto, and that the so-called "Colonial" of the United States which has been so absolutely boiled to rags by ardent caricaturists in Canada as well as in the United States, has little hold upon Toronto. The influence of the modern English school on the other hand has rooted deeply in a congenial soil, and in so many able hands will doubtless greatly thrive in the near future. Toronto has a great architectural future and if the members of the profession will but work together the Queen City will probably give the note to the character of Canadian Architecture.

The modelling and carving of an immense frieze on the <building>Stanford University memorial arch</building>, in California, marks the completion of a colossal undertaking in sculpture. The arch is over 100 ft. high and is built of San Jose limestone; running around it at a height of So ft. is the frieze, illustrating American civilization. The total length of thc frieze on the four sides of the structure is 232 ft.; its height is 12 ft. It contains 150 heroic figures in high relief.
