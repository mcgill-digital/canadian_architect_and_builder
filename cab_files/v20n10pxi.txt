ELECTRICAL DELIVERY OF MAIL IN APARTMENT HOUSES.

A feature of some of the latest apartment houses in course of erection in the Borough of Manhattan, New York, is an electrical device for the automatic delivery of mail to occupants, which has recently been approved by the Postmaster-General. The device consists of a straight up and down well. about 18 inches square, running the height of the house and containing an elevating and lowering apparatus which takes up and down a steel tray with metal boxes. The apparatus works automatically and perpetually, making no mistakes and submitting tenants to no delays. Entering the vestibule, the postman leaves the mail in an automatic carrier, to which he carries the key. Having placed it in the proper box—there is one for each apartment —he simply closes the door, which starts into action the electric machinery. This carries the various boxes into which the mail matter has been placed up the well. The power required is slight, not greater than that necessary to operate an electric fan.

By a simple contrivance the boxes are dropped off from the carrier at the apartments where they belong. and at the same time overturned, so that the mail falls out in the locked receptacle inside the apartment.

The automatic carrier keeps on going up until it reaches the top, when it descends again, picking up the boxes as it comes down.

LIGNINE CARVINGS.

For years imitations of hand carved wood ornaments have been made from whiting, glue anti ingredients, all more or less unsatisfactory. The inventors of Lignine Carvings,'' however, are convinced that they have at last, discovered a highly satisfactory substitute for wood carving. By this method a model is first designed by a master workman, no expense being spared to have as perfect an example of the wood sculptor's art as it is possible to obtain. From this model the Lignine carvings are produced, with all the

perfection of form of the original. The process results in an imitation that is true to the original, shows full depth of grain, discloses the chisel marks, and even shows the flakes more clearly and distinctly.





In some of the European art galleries the dust is removed from the paintings anti statuary by means of an air pump, a jet of air being thrown with great force against the article which needs dusting.
