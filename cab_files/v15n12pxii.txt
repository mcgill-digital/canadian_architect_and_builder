Among the papers to be presented will be one by Prof. Shortt, of Toronto University, the subject of which has not been announced, also one by Mr. E. C. Shankland, C. E., of Chicago, Ill. on "Modern Constructive Methods."

In a case heard recently in the Court of Session, Edinburgh, a draughtsman was giving evidence, when the opposing counsel asked: "Do you draw everything larger than it realty ought to be? The reply came promptly: "Everything but my salary."



The Amherstburg Stone Quarry, situated at Amherstburg Ont., are making extensive and valuable improvements to their great plant. Over 200 men are now employed in getting out block and building stone of all sizes and dimensions. The quality and strength is above the standard required by thc Government for public works in Canada. They are doing an immense trade in crushed stone and limestone. All this is due, so the Amherstburg people say, to the energetic manager, Mr. T.W. Bellhouse. A representative of this journal was shown over this plantâ€”the enormous amount of great dimension blocks in sight was a wonder. Some of this has gone to the Sault St. Marie canal works. Railway tracks now run right into the quarry which has been constituted a regular railway station. Mr. Bellhouse is to be congratulated upon the success of the company.
