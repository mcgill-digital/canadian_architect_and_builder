The Spence "Daisy" Hot Water Heater























IS BY FAR



THE BEST IN THE



MARKET.

WE MAKE



THIS STATEMENT



WITHOUT FEAR OF



CONTRADICTION 





















THE DAISY" is the Product of many years' experience in the manufacture of Boilers for Heating Purposes.



THE "DAISY" is up to date—possessing all the latest improvements. 20,000 people who use them testify to their superiority.



THE " DAISY" possesses all the essential features of a First—Class Heater.



The largest possible effective heating surface exposed to the fire.



Each section is an independent heater.



The circulation of the water throughout the system ensues without friction.



Every joint is machine milled, and perfectly true, thus avoiding leakages; a defect which exists in so many other heaters.



<doctype type="ad">THE "DAISY" heats on its own level.



It requires very little attention.



So well known is the "DAISY" it has become a household word, and a dwelling heated by the " DAISY" will rent or sell to better advantage than if heated by an inferior boiler.





There are many imitations in the market, but this is only in outward appearance. Their circulation and construction

is imperfect. We have made this a life-long study and give you the benefit of our experience.



BE NOT DECEIVED. USE THE "DAISY" and no other.
