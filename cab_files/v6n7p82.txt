or, since it decomposes with ease and stains and discolors the rock. Pyrites in sharp, well-defined crystals sometimes decomposes with great difficulty. If a crystal or grain of pyrites is embedded in soft, porous light colored sandstone's, its presence will certainly soon demonstrate itself by the black spot which will form about it in the porous stone, and will permanently disfigure and mar its beauty. if the same grain of pyrites is situated in or near very hard, compact nonabsorbent stone, the constituent numerals of which are not rifted or cracked, this pyrites may decompose and the products ire washed away, leaving the stone untarnished.
