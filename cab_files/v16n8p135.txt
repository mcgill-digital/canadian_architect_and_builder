NOTES.

One of the features of the modern house that makes or unmakes its finished elegance is the plumbing and all care and attention given to that branch of the house will prove profitable. So rapid have been the strides toward betterment in plumbing fixtures during thc last few years that not everyone is familiar with the high grade sanitary appliances which arc sold to-day. The

James Morrison Brass Manufacturing Company, Limited, of Toronto, have for years been the designers of many of the improved appliances used by plumbers and their line of equipment for every purpose to-day represents the highest attainment in manufacture. Anyone who is interested in modern plumbing would find the catalogue of the Morrison Company of interest and value.
