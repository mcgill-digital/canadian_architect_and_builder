APRIL 7th, 1890.



Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BULLOER.



DEAR SIR,—Would you kindly inform me through your valuable journal whether a contractor, under a contract similar to the revised contract used by the architects and builders of Toronto, would be justified under "clause 8," in refusing the owners or their Janitor access to a building prior to its completion, for the purpose of putting on fires, unless relieved by the owners from all liability under the above clause? and if the contractor did the firing, would he be entitled to be paid by the owner for his services. The contractor having allowed the owners to use the building some two months before his contract expired, and before other portions of the building were finished, and access to the furnaces being impossible except through the unfinished portion where shavings, chips, etc., were scattered in abundance, would the owners be justified in enforcing "clause 9," and in charging the contractor with the insurance while they were themselves using the building? An answer will oblige.

Yours truly,

SUBSCRIBER.



[This is clearly a question of law, and one which we imagine a lawyer even would decline to express an opinion upon without being in possession of all the circumstances of the case. It may be that "Subscriber" is behind with his contract. This and a score of other circumstances might have to be taken into consideration in deciding a case of this kind. We would advise "Subscriber" to lay all the circumstances before a lawyer and be governed by whatever he may advise.—ED. A. & B]

The following is an easy method of calculating the area of cross section of waney timber or of any regular or

symmetrical octagon.



RULE—If a b =cd the area equal

or thickness of the log, less the square of the wane e f, as it is immediately seen that the square e g on e f is equal to the four wanes or the log.

If a b and c d be unequal, which they often are to the extent of an inch or two, then the area is

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—In glancing over my essay on plumbing which you were good enough to print in your last issue, I would call your attention to one or two slight errors, viz.

"Brick piers" should be read in place of" thick piers." I am made to say "waste pipes, etc, should never be trapped," etc., whereas the "never" should be omitted. "Draw off trap" should read "draw off tap."

Yours truly,

MONTREAL, March 20th, 1890.



Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—In inserting illustrations of some of the sculpture from <person>Mr. Drummond</person>'s house here in last month's issue, you omit any mention of the carver. We will feel obliged by your stating in your next issue that Mr. <person>H. Beaumont</person>, of this city, executed all the sculpture and carving for us on this building from our designs and full size drawings, and we have pleasure in bearing testimony to the fidelity and spirit with which he interpreted our ideas.

The capitals of the porch columns which you illustrated, ARE emblematic of Architecture, Music, Painting and Sculpture.

Faithfully yours,

HAMILTON, March 20, 1890.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



As the advent of the incorporation of the architects of the Province of Ontario is close at hand, when the profession can rank with the other learned professions, it behooves its members to be firmly united in spint and practice, and to have a code of rules and conditions strictly to be observed under all circumstances, and from which any departure could only be made at the risk of the party so deviating. This code of rules and practice should be prepared with wisdom, forethought and discretion, so that when the proclamation is made it will be favorably received by all the parties concerned.

Yours truly,

ARCHITECT.



<article title="the proper position for inlet pipes" author="">THE PROPER POSITION FOR INLET PIPES.

TORONTO, March 15, 1890.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—What are our master plumbers thinking about, when, as reported in this month's issue of your paper, they want to have the inlet pipe for fresh air carried up to the roof of the houses when it is considered unsightly on the ground? If this is done, it is no longer an inlet; the very principle is affected by this absurd proposition. It would then be the same height as the soil pipe carried up through the roof, and there would be
