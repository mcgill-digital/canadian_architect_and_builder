V.

<person>Hurd Peters</person>, City Engineer of Saint John, New Brunswick, was born at Fredericton, N. B., being one of the younger sons of Hon. <person>Charles Jeffrey Peters</person>, Attorney-General of that Province.

After passing through the Collegiate school (silver medal) Mr. Peters took his degree of A.B. and A.M. at King's College, from the University of N. B. (gold medal). he also took his diploma at the special course in engineering at that time instituted under <person>Mr. Cregan</person>, C.E.

After having been employed on the European and North American R. R. between St. John and Vanceboro and on what is now the Intercolonial, between St. John and Moncton, as leveller, he spent some time working in the United States.

In 1854, in partnership with <person>I. Edward Boyd</person>, M.I.C.E., who recently died while in charge of the harbor works. Quebec, he opened an office under the title of <firm>Peters & Boyd </firm>for private practice in St. John. When Mr. Boyd subsequently took a position on the government railways, Mr. Peters continued in private practice until April, 1861, when he was appointed City Surveyor. Two years later, July, 1863, he was appointed City Engineer that office being then for the first time establishedâ€” and has so continued to the present time. He was one of the first Council of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers, and his name appears in the Act of Incorporation.

The record of Mr. Peters' work is to be found in the present state of the city, for which he has been engineer for some 30 years.

Mr. Peter's has also taken an active part in militia affairs, having retired with the rank of Lieut.-Col. 2nd Battalion St. John County Militia. He has likewise tilled positions of trust in connection with the Episcopal Church.

Mr. Peters had his residence and office with all his plans and memoranda, destroyed in the conflagration which over took St. John in 1877.

J B. R." writes as follows from the North west Territory :

"It was the intention of the company with which I am employed as superintendent of construction to build concrete, but for different reasons the com

-	pany changed to frame and rough-cast. This left a large quantity of Selkirk lime on hand. Last fall I dug a large pit 14'X 12' x 2', and ran it full. After covering it with a good layer of sifted sand, I placed a rough floor over this, then another layer of sand and protected this again with manure. Will I meet with as good results when I re quire it as if I had left it to air slake? I was never placed in this position before, but was once told by a stone mason that the longer the better."

ANs. Storing lime in the manner mentioned by our correspondent k calculated to improve rather than to injure the quality. In England lime is frequently stored in cellars for the purpose of improving it. When thus treated it is called "putty lime," and is chiefly used for finishing. Unless the lime has suffered from the severe frosts, it will no doubt be found all right, and we would advise our correspondent if possible to keep it for finishing purposes. It will be found to be cool and will not crack. ED. C. A. & fl.j

<article title=" AMATEUR DECORATING " author="Elliott, W.H.">AMATEUR DECORATING.

By <person>W. H. Elliott</person>.

I NOTICED a paragraph a short time since in a daily newspaper in which the writer bewailed the slavery into which suffering humanity had fallen to the autocratic decorator. " People," said he, " no longer embody in their rooms their own taste, and are denied the opportunity for displaying to admiring friends their admirable traits of character ; on the contrary, a woman of simple tastes is put into a gorgeous boudoir of extreme French design and so on." The perpetual hunting for a grievance in writing on aesthetic matters is at times very wean some, especially in view of the fact that in most cases the fault-finding with existing conditions is not borne out by actual experience. The cry for something different continually goes up, though Heaven only knows what different is wanted. If French ideas are introduced the good old English simplicity has gone for ever. If solid English design is used the aesthetic grumbler sighs for the lightness and greater artistic beauty of the French. And now we are told that the helpless public has fallen hopelessly into the hands of the professional decorator, and what an unfortunate thing it is that one cannot choose one's surroundings for one's self, as if we do not all know that for a decade past the decorating amateur has revelled in a reign of terra cotta and muddy green to his heart's content, producing the most thrilling effects for those who responsively thrill. And it is only that we have emerged at last from this period of indefiniteness and taken up something requiring knowledge, skill and caution in its handling

I say it is only for this reason that our aesthetic Israelites are lamenting their captivity and the end of their muddy period. Now it is not true that the decorator usually serves all people alike without regard to their characters, tastes and positions. In a great many cases he has a clearer idea of what will suit his client than the client can possibly have because of his inexperience and lack of knowledge of many possible variations in the treatment of his rooms. In how many Cases does the ambitious householder see an effect in somebody else's house or at an hotel or in a pullman car which if not modified or tabooed entirely by the decorator, would he appropriated for the house and lay the householder open to the ridicule of every one of good taste. We feel a tender pity for the man who commits himself to the " every man his own architect " sort of influence, but the results consequent upon every man becoming his own decorator are quite as sorry and frequently more palpable be cause of the lack of examples to follow, such as every builder of houses has in the houses already built.

The refined and classical styles at present in vogue calling for decorative taste of the highest order, cannot he successfully played with by ambitious amateurs, and yet may be safely used in some one or other of their variations to suit almost anybody's taste and pocket hook. What more can we ask than that, after providing a suitable background, he leave to our individual tastes the many little accessories, that more than the walls and ceiling may he made to exhibit an individuality and preference. Prettier rooms by far will be made for the next few years than have been made in the preceding ones, and the effect will rarely be marred for the lack of interference on the part of the amateur decorator.



Messrs. <firm>Evans, Coleman & Evans </firm>have been appointed agents at Vancouver for the <firm>British Columbia Terra Cotta Co. </firm>of Victoria, B. C. The company have produced some fine samples.

A patent Spanish tile made of copper and tin is being manufactured by <firm>Merchant & Co</firm>., of Philadelphia. Among the advantages claimed for them is that they arc much lighter and more durable than tiles made from clay.

The <firm>Manitoba Stone and Asphalt Paving Co. </firm>have started business in Winnipeg. It is their intention to engage in the manufacture of tiles, to construct asphalt pavements, and act as agents for American manufacturers of pressed brick, over-mantels, etc.
