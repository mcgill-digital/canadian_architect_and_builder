On visiting the works of the <firm>Toronto Plate Glass Importing Company</firm>, Toronto, a representative of this Journal, learned that they have recently added to their <building>new factory at Nos. 209 to 213 Victoria St.</building>, a thoroughly up-to-date glass bending oven. This branch of their business is now in complete operation. This is said to be the only plant of its kind in Canada for the bending of glass on the most approved principles.

photo in the Company's advertisement in this issue illustrates the oven used for bending all sizes of glass. It is built of brick and has a capacity of 1,000 feet of glass per 24 hours. The glass is first cut to required sizes, then placed on a truck on which are large steel moulds. It is then fed into tile oven which is hot enough to bend the glass to the required shape, after which it passes through a process of annealing to prevent it from being too brittle. This process reduces the temperature until

the glass becomes gradually cooled to a flesh heat. The process is very complete and produces such a finish on ordinary glass that, but for thickness, it can hardly be distinguished from plate glass. Previous to this oven being installed, a large proportion of the bent glass used by this firm had to be imported. In consequence, orders could not be delivered promptly. This delay operated against the use of bent glass. The Toronto Plate Glass Importing Company now claim that they can deliver orders, if necessary, one day after received. This promptness of delivery and reduction in cost should largely increase the use of bent glass for all purposes, and will no doubt prove to be a great convenience to architects, and those using bent glass.







A CORRECTION.



Our attention has been called to several errors in the letter of our Montreal correspondent printed in our January issue, In this letter Messrs. <firm>McKim, Mead & White </firm>are given the entire credit of being the designers and architects for the <building>new Bank of Montreal</building>. This statement, we learn, is entirely erroneous and misleading, as Mr. <person>A. T. Taylor</person>, <assoc>F.R.I.B.A</assoc>. is joint architect with McKim, Mead & White, and the building has been jointly designed, and is being carried out in every particular under the joint care of the above named architects. We sincerely regret this mis-statement, and others of less importance, appearing in our correspondent's letter, and take the earliest opportunity of directing attention to them, in order to repair, as far as possible, any mis-conception which may have arisen in consequence of their publication.
