Combination Steam and Hot Air Heater



No.	29,900. The <firm>J. F. Pease Furnace Co</firm>., Toronto, Ont. (assignee of <person>John F. Pease</person>. Syracuse. N.Y., U.S.,) 19th September, 1888 5 years.





Fig. 2 If this be not sufficient to prevent its warping, ledgers can be screwed across the hack, hut the above ought to give a firm unyielding surface. that is, if the work on it be properly done.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



Replying to the inquiry in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for December. "How a board 4 feet square to 1 inch thick, can be made so it will not warp," I would submit the following:

While seemingly a very simple thing, it is often a troublesome thing to make a board with the required surface and so little thickness, which " will not warp." I do not think it adds very much to the certainty of a board lying true and out of wind to ' build it up ' from small thin strips, or thin layers crossing each other

as I have seen some boards made in that way develop a tendency to warp as badly as any. Such a construction is much more expensive than some other ways which will secure equally as good results.

For such a hoard, I would recommend pine, perfectly seasoned and clear, not less than 1/8 inch thick, in strips 4 inches wide, grooved and tongued together These strips should be ploughed or grooved on the hack or under side one inch from each edge, with a groove ½ inch wide, and one half the depth. In addition to this, the surest protection against warping is to put cleats on the back, made of hardwood, fastened with screws, the screw boles through cleats being somewhat elongated as slots to allow for any shrinking or swelling in the width of board. If it is necessary or very desirable to do away with cleating on back, I should put battens 2 inches wide, same thickness as board, across each end, grooving and tongueing same. All joints should he well glued.

If California redwood was available, I should much prefer it to any other lumber, as it is perhaps the least likely to shrink, swell or warp. With this lumber, 4 boards 12 inches wide, well jointed and battened across ends. simply glueing without tongueing would give as satisfactory results as a more expensively made board from many other kinds of lumber
