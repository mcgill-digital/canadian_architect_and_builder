THE theory has been propounded, and A New Danger. from its reasonableness, has met with

considerable favor, that the settlement of the east wall of the Masonic Temple building at Chicago is due to the jar caused by frequent and abrupt stopping of the elevators, sixteen in number, which are ranged along the greater part of the extent of this wall. It is contended that these elevators, more particularly when descending, act as weights suddenly applied. This action in the case of a building of extreme height, erected on defective soil like that of Chicago, would seem to be likely to have an injurious effect upon the construction.



IT is quite a common thing to see the

Disintegration of

Surface of Brick,	appearance of brickwork marred by scaling of parts of the surface of the



bricks. In northern climates such as that of Canada, this scaling is often the result of expansion due to the action of frost—especially in the case of porous, soft-burned bricks, which easily absorb water. Other causes assigned are: Lime in the clay of which the brick is composed; want of care on the part of the manufacturer in connection with the damp course, resulting in the accumulation of moisture behind the surface of the brick and the presence in the brick of hard pellets, the rate of expansion of which differs materially from that of the other constituents. If the clay is properly pugged while in course of manufacture few of these mischief-working pellets will find their way into the finished article.



REFERRING to the expose', in our last Architectural Corn- issue, of the methods which are being

A competition was instituted for designs for a county court house at Passaic, New Jersey. The building committee obtained the services of Professor Ware as expert adviser, and owing to this fact a large number of architects of good standing entered the competition. The committee, evidently with the object of favoring local architects, disregarded the recommendation of their adviser and awarded prizes to competitors whose designs were not considered by Professor Ware to be entitled to rank above the second or third class. The architects whose designs were selected by Professor Ware have entered a joint action for damages in the
