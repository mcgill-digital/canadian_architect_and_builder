THE term "joiner" does not mean a carpenter, says the Canadian Presbyterian. It means a man or woman who joins all the societies and associations in the community.



THE twenty-eighth annual convention of the American Institute of Architects will be held on the 15th, 16th and 17th of October in New York city. A number of valuable papers are promised for the occasion.



WE print in this number an interesting letter from Mr. G. F. Stalker, in advocacy of a change of method in the designing and erection of government buildings. The attention of our readers has already been called to the favorable reception of the Bill introduced in the United States Congress to provide for throwing open to competition among the leading architects of that country work of this character. This is the system which has prevailed for some time with satisfactory results in Great Britain. The subject is one in which Canadian architects should feel an interest, and which might fitly receive some consideration at the approaching annual conventions of the Province of Quebec and Ontario Associations of Architects. We would be pleased also to print the individual opinions of architects on the

subject.	________________________





ON every hand there are indications of a revival of trade. The settlement of the American tariff question has had a beneficial influence on commerce in the United States, which is certain to extend to Canada. As the result of the free exportation of Canadian lumber into the United States market, we may expect to witness great activity in the manufacture of rough and finished lumber in Canada, and this must have a beneficial influence on every department of trade. During the depression through which we have been passing, manufacturers and merchants have reduced stocks to the lowest possible point. With increased purchasing ability will come a revival in manufacturing and other industrial enterprises. It is now too late to expect much improvement in conditions this year, but the indications for 1895 seem to be of a very encouraging character.



A PIECE of scaffolding work requiring more than ordinary care was put up in Toronto last month by Messrs. Dill & O'Hearn, contractors, for painting the spire of St. Patrick's church on William street. A scaffold more than sufficient for paint work was necessary to gild the large cross at the top. The height from the ground to the top of the cross is one hundred and sixty nine feet. The construction of the spire prevented access to the inside to a greater height than one hundred and ten feet. Here, through four small window openings, built up beams 6" X 12" were placed projecting level five feet, the inside ends made secure by blocking to the spire timbers. On these a platform was laid three feet wide all around. All the scaffolding material was hoisted up to this height with a rope and pulley outside. On the platform, directly over the beams, four corner poles were footed and blocked with diagonal braces to each other and back through the window openings. The balance of the work was carried up in the usual way with poles lashed together and stagings at every six feet of its height. The completed work was severely tested by a heavy storm on Sunday, Sept. 2nd, but stood uninjured. Considerable difficulty was experienced in laying the gold leaf on account of high winds, but this was overcome by pitching a tent twelve feet high on the top staging to cover in the cross while that part of the work was being done.
