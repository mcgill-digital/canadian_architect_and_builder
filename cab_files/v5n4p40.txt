<article title="Toronto Builders' Exchange" author="">TORONTO BUILDERS' EXCHANGE.

WE have much pleasure in presenting to readers of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER the portrait of Mr. Wm.



<person>J. Hill</person>, the President of the newly organized <assoc>Builders' Exchange of Toronto</assoc>, accompanied by a few particulars concerning the organization. The other officers are: <person>George Moir</person>, 1st Vice-President; <person>George Oakley</person>, 2nd Vice-President; <person>David Williams</person>, Treasurer; <person>John Aldridge</person>, <person>Benjamin Brick</person>, <person>William Park</person>, <person>James Crang</person>, <person>M. Murphy</person>, <person>J. L. Nichols</person>, Directors.

The Exchange owes its existence to the fact that the <assoc>Federated Association of Builders and Contractors</assoc>, which it supersedes, was not fulfilling the objects it was designed to serve, and certain members determined no longer to be satisfied with its inefficiency, but to establish a new organization founded on the lines of the Builders' Exchanges represented by the <assoc>National Association of Builders of the United States</assoc>, whose operation has proved to be most beneficial and satisfactory. The formation of the old Association was such that it was almost impossible to secure concerted action on any question. It was composed of an equal number of delegates from the different trades, and was designed to be maintained by the imposition of a capitation tax. Being thus made up of a number of independent bodies, there was the tendency to narrowness and sectionalism when occasion called for broad and liberal measures. The organization was necessarily unwieldy and lacked

cohesiveness.

in 1891 some energetic members of the Master Masons' section, as has been stated, tired of the organization and withdrew from it, with the object of instituting some thing better. A sufficient list of signatures was easily obtained to enable application to be made for a charter, which was granted, the provisional Board of Directors consisting of Messrs. <person>G. Wright</person>, M. Murphy, J. Crang, J. Aldridge, <person>W. Williams</person>, B. Brick and J. Nichols.

A code of by-laws was drawn up, and a book of certificates of membership printed, and although scarcely two months have elapsed since its formation, we are informed that fully 80 per cent. of the builders and contractors of the city have become connected with the organization, which may be regarded as a sufficient justification of the wisdom of the promoters of the under taking.

The membership is divided into two classes, designated as "corporate" and "non-corporate"

members. The former includes all persons actively engaged as building contractors, and the latter, manufacturers and dealers in building materials. "Non-corporate" members enjoy all the privileges of the Exchange, except that of voting. The fees are the same for both classes, viz., $10 per year, and in the case of new members, an additional entrance fee of $10.

Ma. W. J. HILL, PRESIDENT TORONTO BUILDERS' EXCHANGE

Applications for membership should be made to the Secretary. The name of every applicant is posted for one week on the walls of the Exchange, at the end of which time if no objection is made the application is dealt with by the Board of Directors. The control of the Exchange is vested in a Board of directors, who must hold corporate certificates. The Exchange has power to form sections to represent the various branches of the building trades and promote their special interests.

Arrangements are being made with dealers for a trade discount to be given to members who may pay their accounts before the tenth of each month. These discounts will be more than sufficient to cover the cost of membership. By this means also an effort is to be made to discourage the credit system which has to so large an extent demoralized the building business.

Any disputes which may arise between members of the Exchange will be adjusted by means an arbitration. Under the by-laws no member is allowed to bring suit in the courts against

another with whom he may have a difference, until every means of settling the difficulty by means of arbitration has been exhausted. Instead of appointing an arbitration committee, the whole Exchange has been constituted a committee of arbitration, so that members desiring the services of arbitrators are at liberty to select from the entire membership persons in whose judgment they may have the most confidence. In this direction the Exchange is likely to be the means of saving its members a large amount of money which would otherwise be spent in litigation. An instance comes to mind of a dispute of a some what trifling nature between a contractor and sub-contractor, the settlement of which by the courts cost the litigants seven hundred dollars. Such cases are not unusual, yet it would no doubt be found possible under the method adopted by the Exchange to bring about a settlement of the greater part of them at a trifling cost. Members desirous of having their claims arbitrated upon will be required to make a deposit sufficient to cover the cost. In this connection it may be mentioned that as members of an incorporated body, members of the Exchange who may in future be called upon to give expert evidence as witnesses in building cases, will he entitled to receive $5 per day for their services, instead of as heretofore, getting $1.00 per day as though their testimony was of no greater value than that of the laborer who might be asked to substantiate the simplest fact.

The Exchange has appointed a Legislation Committee to provide for the improvement of the form of contract, and laws affecting the building trade; a Committee to provide for improved arrangements between the contractor and the architect with regard to the method of issuing certificates, etc., and a Labor Committee to secure better arrangements as to wages and other matters affecting the relation ship of employers and employees.

The new Exchange has started out honorably by paying off all moral and legal liabilities of the old Association. It starts out with-out any entanglements or old agreements, and will refrain from making any agreements until certain objectionable conditions which at present prevail shall have been remedied.

In concluding this reference to the new Exchange, which seems designed to have a most successful career, we reprint from a copy which has come into our hands the "Stipulations of the Toronto General Builders' Society," bearing date February, 1867, together with the names of the members representing the various trades, many of whom still occupy positions of prominence and public esteem:

1.	Detail drawings to be furnished by the architect at the time of tendering,

2.	Contractors to attend at the required time, and be present at the opening of tenders,

3.	The lowest tender to be accepted, and if not accepted or work not proceeded with, such tenderer to be remunerated at the rate of one-half per cent, on new work, or one per cent. on alterations and repairs, for time, trouble and expense in preparing such tenders.

4.	Work not mentioned in the specifications, or shewn on the drawings at the time of tendering, to be paid for as extra work.

5.	The owner of the property to execute the contract in duplicate, and sign plans and specifications, at the same time as the contractor, and one duplicate original, so executed, to be delivered to contractor.

fi. The contractor to be paid as the work progresses, at the rate of eighty-five per cent. on work done and materials furnished including extra work.

7.	The contractor to have a lien on the building or other erection for unpaid contract money, and the right, if so disposed, to withhold possession until the contract money, or such portion thereof as he may be entitled to at the time of the completion of the work, be paid.

s The work, as it progresses, to be kept insured in some responsible insurance office, in the name either of the owner or contractor, and such insurance to be for the joint benefit of both in the proportions in which they are respectively interested, and the premium, if paid by the contractor, to be added by him to the amount of his contract.
