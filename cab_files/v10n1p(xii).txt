THE FINEST IN

THE DOMINION















Mode of operation-When Pressure is applied to Seat, Lever attached to Nickel-plated Hinge A raises Rod B, so that End of Rod passes up over Lever C; when Pressure is relaxed, Rod B descends, drawing Lever C down, simultaneously opening Syphon Valve D, and releasing Lever C, which returns to position as shown.



In each operation about eight gallons of water is discharged, insuring sufficient supply of water to flush closet thoroughly.



This Automatic Attachment can be used on any of our Acme Closets, and on any other style of closet, with equal satisfaction.

It is undoubtedly the most convenient, most sanitary and best devised combination that has ever yet been offered to the public.
