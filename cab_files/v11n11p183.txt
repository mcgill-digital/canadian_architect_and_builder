THE agreement regulating prices enPrices of Radiators. tered into some time ago by the rnanufacturers of radiators in the United

States, terminated in September. Thus far the manufacturing companies appear to have been unable to arrive at a satisfactory understanding on which to base a new agreement. The situation has resulted in a war of competition among the manufacturers, who, finding themselves encumbered with heavy stocks, are slaughtering their goods at almost any figures. It is stated that radiators are being sold in the American market as Low as 121/2 cents per pound. Unfortunately for Canadian manufacturers, large quantities of American radiators are being shipped into the Dominion, with the result that in this market also, prices have been forced down to a point where little or no margin of profit remains. This condition of affairs is largely due to the heavy duty and freight charges which Canadian manufacturers are required to pay on their raw material. As regards wages, United States manufacturers are said to have the advantage also. Formerly the standard of mechanics' wages was higher in the United States than in Canada, but this condition is now said to be reversed, wages having been forced down in the States by the competition of foreign labor. It is especially unfortunate for Canadian radiator manufacturers that they should be subjected to this unfair competition when a revival of building enterprise is being experienced, and when in consequence there is a brisk demand for their goods.
