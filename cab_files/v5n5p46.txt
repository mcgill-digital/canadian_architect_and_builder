<doctype type="text">	46 THE C ANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER. May 1892



IN response to a number of requests, we have decided to publish in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for June, the examination papers in connection with the first O. A. A. students' examinations. In this number we present reproductions of a couple of the drawings submitted in these examinations, which will serve to indicate to students taking part in future examinations the character their drawings should assume.



THE <assoc>Toronto Builders' Exchange </assoc>is desirous of making some arrangement with the architects which will serve to avoid the delays at present experienced by contractor in obtaining certificates. A contractor who may be doing work for several architects, sometimes finds it impossible to get around to their offices-and secure his certificates on certificate day, on account of being obliged to wait his turn in each office. It is suggested that this inconvenience could be avoided by the contractors notifying the architect of his desire to obtain a certificate for a stated amount previous to certificate day, when the certificate could be filled out ready to be handed to him when he might call.



THE Toronto Builders' Exchange, an account of the formation and objects of which was published in our April number, is making satisfactory progress. The membership has increased to such a degree that it has been found necessary to remove to more commodious quarters. These have been secured in the new premises now being fitted up at the corner of Victoria and King streets. The Exchange will take possession of its new home on or about the first of June, and will then have, in addition to a large exchange room, necessary committee rooms and secretary's offices. Mr. <person>John Phillips </person>has been appointed Secretary of the Exchange. It is believed the appointment will prove to be satisfactory. It has been decided to abolish the two classes of membership heretofore existing, and hereafter to allow all members to occupy the same footing. From the fact that during the past month further applications for information have been received from other cities desirous of forming exchanges, it would seem probable that the organization of the building interests throughout the country will be an event of the near future.



RECENT advices from Vancouver, B. C., point to indications of a busy season for the building trades. The unsettled conditions existing between contractors and mechanics, however, are said to be proving a check upon activity. Some of the contractors are reported to be desirous of increasing the working day from nine to ten hours, while others, rather than provoke trouble with the unions, are willing to pay union wages for a nine hours day. The employers very justly complain of the practice of the unions in demanding increases in the rate of wages without giving due notice which would enable them to embody in their estimates the increased cost of labor. These demands for higher wages are most frequently made after contractors have undertaken a large amount of work, the estimates for which have been based upon the prevailing labor prices. The contractors feel, so long as this unfair treatment is accorded to them by the unions, that they are justified in endeavoring to secure workmen from Eastern Canada and elsewhere, even though by so doing the local labor market should become overstocked. An effort should be made to come to an understanding, as is done in Toronto and other eastern cities, under which the rate of wages in the several trades would be fixed for a period of three or five years. Thus the conditions affecting employees employers and investors would be settled for a definite period.



THE result of the examinations of the <assoc>Ontario Society of Architects </assoc>is in every way very satisfactory. They were held too late for us to give the results in our last issue, the reports of the examiners not being in. Since then the Board of Examiners has held its final meeting, made its reports to the Council, and the results have been made public to a certain extent, in the daily press. For our part we are glad to place on record in our columns the names of those who successfully passed the final examination, which we do in alphabetical order: <person>Baxter, D. G</person>.; <person>Bayley, C. M</person>.; <person>Bond, C. H. A</person>.; <person>Brown, J. F</person>.; <person>Gregg, A. H</person>.; <person>Hynes, J. P</person>.; <person>Langley, C. E</person>.; <person>Matthews, H. E</person>.; <person>McCallum, R. J</person>; <person>Munro, W. L</person>.; <person>Smith, Eden</person>, <person>White, M. A</person>.; <person>Woolnough, J. J. </person>The candidates, whether successful or not, have not been allowed, we understand, to know their marks. The examinations have been throughout conducted on the lines of the University examinations, where the marks are known only to the Board of Examiners. On the whole, the passing of thirteen out of nineteen is a very good proportion, and while we wish our new architects every success in the future, we would say to those who failed that there is no reason for discouragement on their part. In many cases to be plucked once is an advantage, and those who were plucked will no doubt set to work earnestly and prepare for a second attack, having found out their weak points, In the second intermediate, nine students passed out of twelve, and in the first intermediate, two out of four. There is to be a supplementary examination some time in September for the benefit of a few candidates in the first and second intermediate classes, whose work at the recent examinations, though not up to the standard, was fairly good, and these will be allowed another chance, that they may be able to take up another stage of examination in the following spring. This advantageous practice of a supplementary

examination has a precedent in the procedure of most professional institutions.

The specification was declared to be a most complete and satisfactory one, all cheerfully complying with its conditions. It was observed that perhaps its most unorthodox feature was the provision made for extras. The carrying out o. this specification was followed by an interesting programme of speeches and music.

Responding to the toast of "The O. A. A.," the President, Mr.

<person>S.	G. Curry</person>, referred to the recent student's examinations. Though not resulting as satisfactorily as might have been desired, yet considering that both students and examiners were without previous experience, they should be regarded as having been on the whole fairly satisfactory, and the knowledge gained would afford a basis for improvement in the future. One beneficial result of such examinations was that they served to direct the study of students in the proper direction. He felt assured that a feeling of timidity prevented many students at the late examinations from doing their best. Many absurd answers would have been avoided if the students had been careful to clearly understand the meaning of the questions. As an example of some of the absurd answers given, a student on being asked for a common test for finding impurity in air replied "Climb upon the roof and put peppermint down the soil pipe." (Laughter). Another student who was asked what would be a
