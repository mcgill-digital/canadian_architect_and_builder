proof partitions with lime mortar. Now I regard that as a very serious defect. I could, I believe, use Rosendale cement mortar. I think that is also defective. When you come to the revision of your building Code—and of course you will come to its revision, because a progressive community has to revise its Code every three or four years. I do not know whether I am touching local pride or not, but do not have any false pride about that. You cannot know as much now as you will three years hence. Therefore when you are three years older you must do something to your building Code. It is about three years old and perhaps you ought to do something now, but if you do anything about it you should insist upon the use of Portland cement for all fire-proof work. By Portland cement I do not mean a cement which tests up to 400 pounds under the 7 days test, but I believe your code—you will correct me if I am wrong—does classify all cements as Portland which test to 400 pounds in 7 days. That is not Portland cement. Rosendale or natural cement from-some fields and under some conditions will test to 400 pounds, but that cement is an absolutely untrustworthy material in a fire. Portland cement, by reason of the high temperature under which it is burned in manufacture, will resist fire to a much greater extent than Rosendale cement or lime. For that reason I urge you to insist upon Portland cement, and in proper proportion. Mortar of in 1 as a good many people use it, of 4 in 1, or even 3 in will not stand up under a fire. It should not be expected to, and yet people do use it and do expect it to stand the test.

I have said nothing about the protection of light shafts and stair wells. It is perhaps unnecessary to dwell upon it further than to say that the walls should be strong enough to enclose a fire, and that the openings should be protected by automatic fire-doors. All that is possible, and your Code admirably pro vides for that.

Fire escapes come under the first consideration in lire-proofing. That is, it is a humanitarian matter. We must get people out of a building before they are smothered or roasted. A fire-escape does not need to be made of fire-proof material. I think wood is  perhaps better than steel. A steel fire escape sometimes gets so hot that it is uncomfortable, and this occurs with steel before wood commences to burn. I came down a steel fire-escape in the Windsor Hotel fire, that was quite uncomfortably warm.

I shall conclude by calling your attention to this aspect. We have been for J5 years at least engaged in this battle with the fire fiend and ingenuity galore has been exercised upon it. We have studied it conscientiously, and all of us, I believe, are conscientious in the expenditure of our client's money. But, let me say to you, gentlemen, that we are not half through the battle. If any of us live 25 years more we shall see such improvements in fire-proofing and the protection of buildings that we will be almost ashamed of the things we are doing today. I am striving with all my heart and soul to protect the buildings I put up, from the fire risk. I neglect nothing that is economically reasonable to protect them; and vet I believe TO years from now I shall look back at these things and perhaps not be ashamed of them, because they are honest efforts, but I shall look back with some pity at my present efforts as amateurish, so I ask you to study and try to solve this problem which is so vital to us all, both from the humanitarian and economic standpoint. (Applause.)



The President I am sorry, gentlemen that we shall not have much time for discussion, and any time we do take will have to be borrowed from that allotted to <person>Mr. Langton</person>. I am glad to see that there are several insurance men here and we shall be pleased to hear from them in regard to any points they may have to raise, and <person>Mr. Brainard</person> I am sure will answer any questions that may be brought up. If our insurance friends are too modest to speak we will be glad to hear from others in the room.

<person>Mr. MacKenzie</person>: Mr. Brainard did not mention the steel column. I would like to ask what he considers the best method of protecting the steel column?

Mr. Brainard: I am glad you asked that question. There were a lot of things I wanted to talk about but the time is short. That is one of the important things. There is another which I forgot. I should insist that no steel member should under any conditions be covered with a less thickness than 2 inches. One of the faults in the terra cotta floor arch was that they put a thin flange, 3/4 of an inch thick, under the steel beam flange, and let it go at that. A most fallacious practice. There should be 2 inches of fireproofing, either concrete or clay fastened to the steel, without any voids in every case. As to columns, which was the particular question, I believe first of all in filling around the column solid, so that all voids—that is if it be a channel or C-bar column—shall be filled with Portland cement. That is partly for rust protection and also for the purpose of filling all voids so that there will he no fire flue. Outside of that I would put 2 inches of concrete, with a steel reinforcement bedded so that the fire cannot get at it; or else fire clay, that is terra

cotta, with steel binders, so that in case of fire it cannot fall off. I regard the steel tie embedded in terra cotta as one of the essential things, but I would have my column filled with cement for rust and fire protection, outside of that reinforced concrete or terra cotta.

Mr<person>. W. R. Gregg</person>: Mr. President, I have much pleasure in moving a vote of thanks to Mr. Brainard for his very useful paper. I am sure we all appreciate

it.	I do not wish to go into a discussion, but perhaps we may have on some future occasion an opportunity for a categorial meeting.

Mr. Gordon: I have much pleasure, Mr. Chairman, in seconding that motion.

The President: I am pleased indeed, Mr. Brainard, to convey to you the thanks of the convention for your admirable address. Among the many important points referred to, that of the periodical revision of our building Code is one of the most important. If we are going to progress we must keep pace with the art by improving our Code. I have very great pleasure in conveying to you the thanks of the Convention. (Applause). _______________________

The annual meeting of the Toronto Builders Exchange was held on Monday, January 15th, at the offices of the Association, Yonge Street Arcade.

The meeting was well attended, and in the absence from the City of the President, the chair was taken by Mr. <person>George Duthie</person>, Vice-President.

The Directors report for last year gave a resume of the work accomplished, and taken on the whole, satisfactory progress was shown. The present premises being too small for the growing membership, negotiations are in progress for more commodious and convenient offices.

The balance sheet for 1905 was a satisfactory statement, and compared well with that of previous years.

As the last annual banquet proved so satisfactory the meeting decided to hold the next banquet at an early date :—The Board of Directors will appoint a committee to make arrangements for same.

The election of officers for current year resulted as follows: President. George Duthie ; 1st vice-president, <person>T. W. Self</person>; 2nd vice-president, <person>C. W. Batt</person>; treasurer<person>, James Crang</person>; Directors, <person>T. Christie</person>, <person>J. R. Hoidge</person>, <person>John Aldridge</person<person>>, Henry Martin</person>, <person>John Maloney</person>. Auditors, <person>George. Clay</person>, C.C.A<person>., Fred Holmes</person>.

The following resolution was moved by Mr. <person>Richard Kirby</person>, and seconded by Mr<person>. John Maloney</person>. That the retiring president, Mr. J. R. Hoidge, be tendered the thanks of this exchange for the very efficient manner in which he has filled the position during his term of office." Carried unanimously. The president-elect, Mr. George Duthie, briefly addressed the meeting, asking the co-operation of members, in carrying out the work of the Exchange. The meeting adjourned at 5 p.m.

At thc annual meeting on the 15th inst. Encouraging reports were presented from all the officers.

The following were elected as the new officers for 1906:—President, <person>George. C. Young</person>; vice-president, <person>John Whittaker</person>; 2nd vice-president, <person>George. Hyatt</person>; secretarytreasurer, <person>George. S. Gould</person>; directors, <person>J. Jones</person>, <person>A. Nobbs</person>, <person>C. Gould</person>, <person>T. Wright </person>and <person>D. Stratfold</person>.

Several matters of importance were discussed, notably the Employers Liability Insurance. Some of the members have discovered to their cost that their policies are so hedged about with conditions that they are worthless to a building contractor. A committee was appointed to take measures towards rectifying this matter. It is felt that to deal with matters of this kind a Provincial Association is required. Such an association could demand and obtain the needed amendments to the Employers Liability Act and to the policies issued by the Guarantee companies to safe guard the interests of contractors.
