GOOD POINTS.

THE







SAFFORD Radiator

Has a Score of them, but there is one which

success has accepted—ITS "SIMPLICITY."





Like all other great inventions, the '' Safford " is

ingeniously simple. It is connected at the joints by

	patent screw nipples	That's what made the

Safford " successful—no bolts, no packing—just a

plain screwed connection. This means that the

Safford " is positively non-leakable——positively

durable. Of all the Radiators the '' Safford " alone

possesses this simple device.

The " Safford " is made in many designs and heights, and it is always graceful in its lines and bulk. It is made to fit in corners, to circle pillars, and for bay windows.



We will be pleased to give you any information you



desire. Remember, we are the Largest Radiator



Manufacturers under the British Flag.
