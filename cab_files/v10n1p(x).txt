The Engineering Record calls attention to the dangers of highspeed elevators, in connection with the recent accident in the <building>American Tract Society building at New York</building>. In this case elevators ran at 700 feet per minute, and the safety device works at a speed of 900 feet per minute. The elevator became unmanageable and went down at a high rate of speed, which was enough to break the bones of the passengers, but not enough to release the safetyâ€”catch and bring the machine to a stop. This journal recommends that the speed of elevators should be restricted to 400 feet per minute.
