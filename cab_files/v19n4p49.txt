control of future erections by making permits necessary; (c), subsequent periodical inspection.

The moral of the occasion, however, is that. new departures in building inspection, (as in insurance or other inspection), should proceed not from disaster but from test cases arising out of zealous insistence by inspectors on the intention of their office until the law is either found or made to support them.

The Illuminating

Engineer.































The Sprinkler Tank

Danger.

A new Person has been added to the complexity of building affairs. The Illuminating Engineer has

arisen; with a Society in New York, The Illuminating Engineering Society, constituted last January for "the advancement and dissemination of theoretical and practical knowledge of the Science and Art of Illumination"; and a technical journal, The Illuminating Engineer, also of New York, of which Vol No 1 has just reached us.



The fall of the tank in Montreal which caused the death of Miss Ross was the second disaster of

the kind in Montreal within ten days. So we learn from a resolution of the Montreal Builders' Exchange urging special inspection of these erections. The first accident attracted little attention. We wait for something dreadful to happen before we are aroused; even though we have suspected danger before. It is about a year since it was suggested in this journal that trestles of exposed steel were not a safe form of support for these tanks, in view of the danger of collapse in case of fire, endangering the lives of firemen. Now is the time to speak of that again; a brick tower is the proper form of support. "If we must have these elevated ornaments", as the Montreal Builders' resolution pathetically says, let them he made both safe and decent looking.

The proposal in the Builders' resolution has three heads: (a), the appointment of a special staff at once to make a thorough inspection of the support of tanks already existing—over a hundred of them; (b), the

The Steel Frame

Building in an Earthquake.

As far as we learn from the newspapers at the time of writing, the steel frame buildings in San

Fransisco were not damaged beyond repair, viewed from outside. Nothing definite has been said about the interior; nothing that would convey an idea whether the floor arching remained in place, so that there was no danger to the lives of occupants of the building. The fire must of done much to obliterate the records of the earthquake, but no doubt there will be a careful investigation of all obtainable evidence in this matter, for apart from its serious interest to other cities, the future of San Francisco as a city of great buildings, which is almost the equivalent of a great city, will depend upon the justification of the steel frame by this test the first, or the first severe test, that it has been subjected to.

It is probable that the rebuilding of San Francisco will show a further development in steel frame design; a development that ought to have taken place before now. The weak point of the skyscraper, in both design and construction, is the continuous surface of the outside shell—a rigid envelope to a slightly flexible frame. It the recommendation of a steel frame for an earthquake belt is the capacity of the steel to endure racking, it should be mated with a system of protection that can be moved by the racking without breaking up. This is only to be managed by building the storey walls separate not only from each other, but from the vertical and horizontal frame protection. it means building and protecting the steel frame first, and then inserting the storey walls. In earthquake regions, at any rate, the storey walls should not be bonded with the frame
