Dominion Paving & Construction Co. v. City of Toronto. â€”Judgment by Chief Justice Falconbridge in the Divisional Court on appeal by defendants MacKeican, from judgment of Meredith, C. J., dated 26th October, 1906. The plaintiffs did certain work on the St. Lawrence Market building, and claimed for extras the sum of $440.58. The defendants set up that, even if the work was clone on the order of the architects, they were not bound by their orders. At the trial the plaintiffs recovered $387.48. The two architects were brought before the court and examined. Held, that the evidence of the architects made abundantly clear what it is said was admitted on the trial. namely, that the work sued for was not within the plans and specifications, not caused by any alteration in the same, but was a mere addition in no wise affecting or relating to anything contained in the contract of plaintiffs or the plans and specifications thereof. Meagre as was the evidence at the trial, even without the evidence given before the court, the judgment of the trial Judge should be sustained. If there is any real dispute as to the proper value, defendants may, at their own expense, take a reference to determine the value, in which case further directions and costs will be reserved. If not, the appeal will be dismissed with costs.
