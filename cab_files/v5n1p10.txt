cut and fitted will stand without cement, as may be seen in ruins of ancient buildings, and first class masonry, with carefully laid courses, well bonded and joints dressed to half an inch for ten inches back approximates to this. But in second or third class masonry, the courses are not so carefully arranged nor the joints so accurately dressed, and more irregular pieces, such as spalls, &c., are allowed in the heart of the wall, in consequence of which the bond is not so strong as in first class, and there is more dependence on the binding power of the cement. Take concrete—where the stones in themselves have absolutely no bond at all—the very best cement is required; so, in my opinion, if any difference in the quality of cement is permissible in different classes of masonry, the best cement should be placed in that class in which the bond of the stones is least able to afford sufficient strength.

<person>Mr. Barrett</person>: Why are tests made of the tensile strength of cement instead of the compressive strength, which is the principal requirement in work?

<person>Mr. Ball</person>: It has been found by experiment that the tensile strength of cement bears a nearly constant ratio to its compressive strength-—about 1-10. A very large and strong machine would be required to make compressive tests, beside which it is difficult to say at what particular weight a cube is crushed, as it splits up into smaller pieces and breaks gradually, whereas tensile briquettes break instantly.

<person>Mr. Woolnough </person>also pointed out that in specifying the weight per struck bushel of Portland cement it was necessary to test a whole bushel filled from a hopper placed at a certain specified height above the measure. A half or quarter bushel filled in the same manner would not be a half or a quarter of the weight of the whole bushel.

Mr. Ball stated that he did not place much value on this test, as it required a large quantity of the cement, was troublesome to make, and was only useful in indicating whether the cement was well burned or not, which could be ascertained by methods before described.

Mr. <person>Virgil G. Marani </person>gave an illustration of a very practical and easily constructed cement testing machine. A lever of wood is. constructed, at one end of which, 1" from fulcrum, the appliance for holding the briquette is attached. At a distance,

































say 12" on other side of fulcrum, an ordinary spring scales is hooked, the strain being produced by a small windlass. Therefore when scales, 12" from fulcrum, register 10 lbs. a time of fracture of briquette, the cement has stood a test of 12 X 10=120 lbs. before making test, the weight of scales is counterbalanced by a sliding weight at a. This, although not an absolutely accurate method, gives very satisfactory results.

<article title="Methods in colouring" author="">"METHODS IN COLORING."

MR. <person>Scott Morton </person>recently read a paper before the Architectural Association on "Methods in Coloring" and commenced with the statement that "the true color-feeling is a rare thing." This talented lecturer gave in his paper a few color laws as follows: Different tones of the same color tell well beside each other or in the same composition, Take, for example, all the tints on a piece of self-colored velvet or silk. There are unending gradations of these. Much interesting work has been done on this idea on the lowest scale of color, viz., that of greys. <person>Mr. Waterhouse </person>expresses his predilections for pearly greys and drabs, including ivory, red or green, with very small points of delicate turquoise blue. Omitting the red or green meantime, his predilections for the pearly greys and drabs, including ivory, are well worthy of being kept constantly in mind, as these are in sympathy with the general greyness of our climate or surroundings, but it will strike all colorists that unless these tints are handled in a masterly way, there is the danger of insipidity. Mr. Scott Morton says that light is an important element in color work. If there is a direct sky light falling into the room, the reflection from the floor, which may be carpeted, counts for much, as its influence is felt on the ceiling and parts of walls not reached by direct light. He suggests for working out a color scheme, the mixing of a pot of what might be termed the dominant or key-color, and from that pot take more or less color for harmonizing and contrasting every tint employed.



One of the chief reasons for the failure of cheap houses to look well is the fact that they are overloaded with ornament, if those who wish to build cheaply would be content to build plainly, the result would be more satisfactory to the eye. The same fault is noticed in cheap furniture. It is always disfigured with fancy turns and machine carving, while to find a piece of plain, substantial finish, one must look at the high priced goods. Too many men only able to build a Cottage, load it with weak imitations of the palace, and the result is thoroughly inharmonious. In the cheap house let plainness of construction reign from foundation to gable. Let the ornamentation be, not in the wood-work, but in the painting. Then the effect may be whatever desired, and may be changed at the pleasure of the owner.
