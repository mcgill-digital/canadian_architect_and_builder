Premier Whitney is considering a proposal, laid before him by the <assoc>Toronto Guild of Civic Art</assoc>, to have the interior walls of the Legislative Buildings in that city decorated by a number of historical paintings, and the Premier is said to be inclined favorably toward the idea.

Ontario is a well-to-do province and could afford to spend some money on providing, at a stroke, for the education of its people in popular art as well as the encouragement of local artists. How it is expected that Canadians will ever become accustomed to the good in art when they arc seldom permitted to see any of it, is a mystery. We speak in envious terms of the art treasures of Europe and the artistic spirit of their people ; but is it to be supposed that nothing is due to the public spirit which paid artists to decorate the walls of nearly every public building of importance and

of the similar interest of the church in art which turned many of the Middle Age chapels into marvellous galleries of paintings 2
