A subscriber writes: I should esteem it a privilege if you could give me information as to current prices of building material (especially thc different qualities of lumber —spruce, white and yellow pine, birch and maple) prevailing in the Winnipeg district at the present time, together with the recognized wages of tradesmen. I am making an estimate for a building outside of Winnipeg, and I understand that there is considerable variation from the prices prevailing in this city.

The Eadie-Douglas Company this coming season intend pushing the sale of their ''Esco'' products. This line was thoroughly tested last season in tile east and met with much success where used. ''Esco'' waterproofing is said to thoroughly waterproof concrete, brick or stone; prevents tile same from absorbing water and keeps tile stone free from discoloration by tile action of its salts Or tile weather. It is also largely used in foundation or cellar work as a regular waterproofing, while on the inside of walls it is used as a damp-proofing to be directly plastered upon. ''Esco'' steel coating is a very popular steel preservative. It will not peel off, protects metals from rust or corrosion. and is equally as good a preservative for wood as for iron or steel.
