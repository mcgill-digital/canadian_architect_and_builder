TO ADVERTISERS.





For the benefit of Advertisers, a copy of this journal is mailed each week to persons mentioned In the CONTRACT RECORD reports as intending to build, with a request to consult our advertisement pages and write advertisers for material, machinery. etc.





NOTWITHSTANDING the great advance in the price of iron, its use in building grows with rapid pace. It is estimated that the Carnegie Company has contracts on hand at present aggregating almost l,000,000 tons of structural material, and no further contracts for delivery before three months can be accepted.



THE building permits granted in Toronto for August amounted to $95,215, as against $94,550 for the corresponding month of 1894. The total permits issued for the first seven months of the year were $1,094,065, and for the same period in 1894 they amounted to $774,895. This substantial increase is due largely to the re-building necessitated by the fires of last winter, but we believe there is a steady growth and that the city is slowly recovering from the disastrous effects of the boom.



BY the merest accident the cause of an acoustical defect, which had been attributed to faulty construction, was recently discovered in <building>Trinity Church, Pittsburg, Penn</building>. A magnificent organ had proved a disappointment, there being a lack of volume and a slightly muffled effect. This was ascribed to the position of the organ. It recently happened that the church was undergoing a thorough repairing and cleaning. The ingrain carpet and padding had been taken up. It was then noticed that the volume of sound from the organ was increased and that the muffled sound had entirely disappeared. The cause was thus, to the surprise of all, discovered to be in the carpet. It is probable a narrow strip of matting or tiles, will be substituted for the carpet in the aisles. Perhaps the reason of defective acoustics in other buildings may be found to arise from a similar cause.



Two native Canadians have just distinguished themselves and their country by their success in the competition for prizes offered for the best plans for two bridges over important waterways in the United States. Mr. <person>Charles Macdonald</person>, son of W. S. Macdonald, Esq., of Gananoque, of which town the former is a native, has won the price for a design for a great railway bridge across the Hudson, between New York and Jersey City, to cost in the neighborhood of $25,000,000. The bridge will be shorter than the Victoria bridge at Montreal, and others in Europe and America, but it will surpass them in that it will have a single span of 3110 feet from one pier line to the other, which is nearly double the longest existing span in the world. It will be 125 feet wide, with six tracks, and is designed on the suspension plan, with steel towers 557 feet in height, and 12 cables supporting steel trusses, which rise 200 feet above the roadway. Mr. <person>Andrew Ouderdonk</person>, the well-known con tractor, is said to be associated with Mr. Macdonald in a company which will undertake the construction of the bridge, as soon as certain necessary preliminary arrangements are completed. Mr. Macdonald has already distinguished himself as a bridge engineer in Australia, and occupies the position of vice-president of the <assoc>American Society of Civil Engineers</assoc>. The other Canadian referred to is Prof. <person>J. G. L. Waddell</person>, a native of Port Hope, a noted bridge builder, and author of one of the best treatises
