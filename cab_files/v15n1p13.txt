Figure 3 is the stress strain diagram of specimens Nos. 2, 3 and 4 within the elastic limit. Allowing for reasonable errors of

observation the line joining the plotted points is a straight line showing conclusively that steel is within these limits perfectly elastic.

Before looking at the classification of steel let its examine very briefly its composition and process of manufacture.

Cast iron as you will remember is a combination of from 2 to 6
