FOR ALL PERMANENT BUILDINGS 





I

 T is significant that Barrett Specification Roofs are almost invariably adopted for buildings with large roof areas, such as factories, railroad build- ings, etc., where the cost and durability of materials must be carefully considered.

An example of this is the well—known

 Allis—Chalmers plant, illustrated herewith.

All the recently erected buildings	carry

Barrett Specification Roofs, amounting 

in all to about 300,000 square feet.

A Barrett Specification Roof in a typical instance (King Phillip Mill, Fall River) was recently renewed after thirty years of service.

Its original cost was less than any style of metal roofing would have been. Tin or sheet iron would have required con tinual painting, and even then would have been liable to rust and corrode, causing loss by leaks. A ready roofing, with its

narrow laps and exposed nailing, would have been entirely unadapted for use on a building of this type, where the roof is of moderate pitch.

the cost per square foot per year o service in the case of Barrett Specification Roofs is remarkably low ; First, because use

the original cost is always		 moderate, and

second, because	the	maintenance ice cost, as

a rule, is nothing, as such roofs require no painting or protection of any kind. In the case of the King Phillip Mill, for instance, the total cost was only about one—fifth of a cent per square foot per  year. 

Low cost and satisfactory service have made Barrett Specification Roofs more largely used than any other kind.

The Barrett Specifications in pocket edition form will be mailed free oii request to anyone interested.
