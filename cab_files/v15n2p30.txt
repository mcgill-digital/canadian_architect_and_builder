QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY, KINGSTON, ONT.

It was decided in laying out the grounds in connection with the new buildings to divide the present Campus into two parts, about equal in area, and the group of buildings now being erected will complete the lower quadrangle; leaving the North, or upper portion of the grounds, which in the meantime will be used as a football campus, for future buildings.

There are two entrances to the University grounds at present, and that from Union street may be termed the public entrance but as the City has gradually grown westward, it was deemed advisable to plan a new entrance from University Avenue. This will ultimately be the main entrance, and leave the present

The new <building>Arts Building </building>situated at the southwest corner of the quadrangle has been erected through the liberality of the citizens of Kingston, who voted the sum of $50,000 towards it. Associated with this building will bc the new <building>Grant Memorial Hall</building>, which will probably be commenced early this Spring-.

To the north of the quadrangle are situated the <building>Geology, Mineralogy and Physics Building</building>-, and <building>Engineering Building</building>, which are being erected by the School of Mining (in affiliation with the Queen's University,) and for which the Provincial Government have provided funds.

In thus laying out the grounds in two quadrangles, it was possible for the building committee to arrange the new buildings so as to complete one of them, leaving the upper quadrangle unhampered in any way for future generations.

It is the intention to lay out the roadways and walks as shown on the block plan and the question of tree planting, shrubberies and general arborcultural effects will be carefully considered in the laying out of the grounds.

The new buildings being brought into such close relationship with the present <building>Arts Building </building>and <building>Science Hall</building>, it was considered best to adapt the style of the new buildings to them, and consequently a Romanesque treatment was chosen,

left rock face random rubble with picked dressings. As the local stone used is of a very hard brittle nature, its use for mouldings was limited; but notwithstanding the entire work, including cornices, steps, and other exterior finish, has been executed in stone, thus doing away with any poorer effects obtained by metal or inferior materials.

The buildings are of slow burning construction, the outer walls being built entirely of stone, and the interior walls of brick; the corridors and entrances being lined with pressed brick. The Arts Building, and <building>Physics and Geology Building </building>are finished throughout in the same manner, the general finish being in pine with the exception of the staircases which are to be of oak, and the flooring which is hardwood throughout. The ceilings of the corridors and staircases are heavily ribbed and finished in pine, and the class
