<article title=" THE COUNTRY CARPENTER " author="">THE COUNTRY CARPENTER.

Anybody who knows the two varieties knows that the old-fashioned country carpenter is as immensely the intellectual as he is the social superior of the modern town-bred carpenter, who has been reduced to become, in his day's work, a dreary specialist whom it were juster to call an automaton, and whom no sane employer would any longer think of invoking for the solution of a practical mechanical problem. The interval is vast. The colonial carpenter was an educated and thinking being, to whom within the sphere of his special information, the community deferred. The modern urban carpenter is the wage-devourer that we know, whose opinion no sane being would think of invoking on any mechanical question outside of his daily routine. No wonder the colonial carpenter became, by an easy transition, the architect of his time, and had no need to add that designation to the designation of his trade. He was quite, as to trained intelligence and mechanical equipment, what we now mean by an architect, while his successor is the automaton and tool of his "union." When we reflect that, for fifteen years, "The Young Carpenter's Assistant" was the vade mecum of the trade, art, or profession to which it was addressed, and when we consider what kind of technical pabulum has supplanted it with the generation of carpenters that now is, we shall find no difficulty in explaining to ourselves how the "young carpenter" of 1805, or of 1817, was so much more professional a person, and so much more respected a citizen, than the ordinary urban members of a carpenters' trade union is in 1905. The question is much larger than one of the practice of architecture.— "M.S.," in the Architectural Record Magazine.
