There is a misconception of the part of the public as to what constitutes a fire-proof building. The opinion is held that buildings such as the <building>Simpson</building> and <building>McKinnon</building> buildings recently destroyed, constructed with iron supports, were intended to be fireproof. This is altogether an error. It was perfectly well under-stood by the architects of these buildings that the safety of these structures was in no way enhanced, but rather endangered. by the use of an unprotected iron frame work. The advantage sought to be gained by the use of this method of construction was rather in the direction of securing larger floor and light areas. As was pointed out in an article on this subject in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for January, iron should not be used for the support of a building unless covered with fire proof material such as porous terra-cotta, and it is hoped that the proposed new building ordinance of the city will render this imperative.

A provision which would to a considerable extent enhance the safety of buildings from injury by fire originating on adjoining premises, would be one which would compel the owners of business buildings to protect with iron shutters the windows in the rear walls abutting on adjoining property. Two of the greatest sources of danger are windows and elevator shafts. The windows are broken by the heat, thus setting in motion currents of air by which the flames from burning buildings adjoining are sucked in through the openings, carrying with them destruction to the interior of the building. It is too much to require owners of office and other business buildings to disfigure them by placing iron shutters on the windows of the principal street elevations, but no such objection could be urged as regards the protection of windows on rear walls.

Yet another valuable protection, to our mind, would be moveable iron floors in elevator shafts, which should be employed at night to shut off each flat of the building. One of the recommendations  of the committee of the 0. A. A. is, that such shafts should be lined with fire-proof material and should have fire-proof doors at the entrances on each flat ; that the shaft should extend three feet above the roof and be covered with glass, which would be easily broken by heat. This provision is a wise one as far as it goes, its object being to confine the fire to the shaft and prevent its spread laterally throughout the building. There is danger, however, that combustible material would be carried through the top of the shaft to the roof of the building and to buildings adjoining. Such a provision as we have mentioned would act as a more complete safeguard, tending to prevent the fire from extending beyond a single flat where, thus confined, it could effectual be dealt with by the firemen.

Some attention should be given to the construction of floors in a manner that would offer greater resistance to fire. The plastering of ceilings is quite a protection to the under side of the floor, and if floors were lined with asbestos or laid in mortar, a much longer time would be required for them to burn

Same, if accompanied by details, 3 per cent. of such estimated cost.



Details, or blue print of same, if imported separately, t per cent. of the estimated cost of such detail.

When additional sets of blue prints of the same set of drawings are imported, such additional sets of blue prints are to be valued for duty at $5 per set in addition to the value of the original drawings, or first set of blue prints imported in lieu thereof, as above.
