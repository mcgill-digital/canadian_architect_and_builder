THE eighth year of publication of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER comes to a close with the present number. An index to the contents of this volume is presented herewith. At the commencement of a new volume and a new year, we may have a few words to say with regard to the progress achieved. Meanwhile, we heartily extend to every reader best wishes For a Happy and Prosperous New Year.





The old Upper Canada College Buildings, Toronto, which it was proposed a year or two ago to use as a public museum and art gallery, are now occupied as a manufactory of tinware. '' To what base uses do we

 come





MONTREAL is to lose its distinction of having the Largest bell on the continent of America. A Cincinnati foundry is about to cast what will be the largest swinging bell in the world for a church in that city. Its tongue will weigh 640 lbs.



THE Architectural Sketch Club, of Toronto, has been re-organized as the Toronto Sketch Club, and will, we trust, do much to encourage good work among its membership, which embraces the students in the various architects' offices in the city. The organization is informal in its character and is intended to cultivate the social as well as the professional element among its members. There will be competitions for designs and at each meeting a critic chosen from among the architects.



The new Jamieson building at the north-west corner of Younge and Queen Streets, Toronto, shows a rounded corner at the street junction, and serves to emphasize the great advantage which would have been secured by rounding in a like manner the corner of the new Simpson building. The opportunity is now past, so far as this building is concerned. Immediate action should be taken, however, to ensure, at least the rounding of the north— east corner, on which stands at present an old and inferior building such as cannot much longer be allowed to occupy so valuable a site. While the opportunity of greatly improving the appearance of the city which existed by reason of the destruction of the former Simpson building has gone by, the importance of. providing means of relieving the street traffic at this point should now be estimated at its proper value.
