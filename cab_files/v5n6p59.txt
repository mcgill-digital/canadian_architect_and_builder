plete the work, or building to be executed, within the stipulated period he is to forfeit and pay to the employer a specified sum per day or per week, for each and every day or week as the case may be which shall elapse between the stipulated and actual date of completion. The sum of money so forfeited by the Contractor is sometimes spoken of as a "penalty," although in most contracts it is expressed to be as "liquidated damages." Distinguish between these

two terms, and give a simple illustration of the difference.

Architect has failed to exercise proper skill in the preparation of these documents? If so, to what extent? and in regard
