HIS house is situated in what might be called "Architects' Row," the five or six residences in the locality being designed by as many different men. It is finished in hardwood throughout. The upper portion of the front is carried out in solid timber-work, filled in with brick.

ARCHITECTURAL OFFICES.

The accompanying cut is a drawing of the new offices of Messrs. Langley & Burke in the new <building>Canada Life Association Building Toronto</building>, recently erected on King Street west, Toronto. The offices occupy the west wing on the 5th or upper floor. The central portion of the public office is lighted by a large skylight. The drawing and references indicate the general arrangements. The dark-room is utilized, in addition to the blue-printing arrangements, for the storage

of old building journals, which are referred to but seldom. The vault is fitted up with the usual compartments for documents and papers, and with a press for drawings, which are kept flat in portfolios, labelled and catalogued for ready reference. Drawings and specifications in daily use are kept in drawers beneath the counters, where they are classified and obtainable at a moment's notice. A catalogue case is provided for the storage of the various trade catalogues, classified and of ready reference. No. 6 is a press for detail drawings which may be required for future reference, while the copies of those required in current work are kept in drawers in counter

16.	The screen enclosing the lavatory and contractors' room is about 6 feet high. A

portion of the contractors' room is occupied by Mr. <person>M. Lough</person>, who attends to the surveying of sites, etc., in connection with the location of new buildings, as well as his own practice of valuator and P.L.S. The private offices are arranged for ready communication between the principals, and Mr. Burke's room has direct access to and overlooks the draughting office.

N an essay read at a recent meeting of Engineers of Fire Departments at Detroit, a <person>Mr. Goetz </person>asks this pertinent question

"Which is the best economy, to continue building as now done, and trust to the fire department; or put up better buildings that will not destroy each other, but will burn out individually ?"

He then proceeds to give some statistics which are truly startling, and which go to show that it is not for lack of efficient fire departments, but that increased precautions and better buildings are the crying necessities of the day. No human power could control many of the fires of the last few years, fires which would never have occurred had right methods of building been observed. Here are a few of his figures:

The Insurance Commissioner of Massachussets estimates that quite 90 per cent. of all fires in that State were preventible. In New York the ratio of fires to buildings was in 1866 as 1 to 80,

while in 1889 it had risen to 1 to 40, and while the number of buildings had increased 80 per cent., and the population 120 per cent., the outbreaks of fire increased 250 per cent.

These instances may be taken as fairly representative of the state of things in all large cities on this side of the water, and indicate that the methods of building and the habits of the people are much more careless than those of the nations of the old

world. In some cases this carelessness reaches almost to criminality, were it not that it must be put down to sheer ignorance.

It is high time that stringent building laws should be enacted in order to save us from ourselves, for we are in reality our own worst enemies.

What other people in the world could witness month after month, and read day after day in the public prints accounts of awful holocausts, where human beings were roasted by the score and where property valued at tens and hundreds of thousands of dollars was literally wiped out of existence, and take it all as a matter of course, forgetting the occurrence in a day or a week?

It has become a recognized fact, that even in the most thoroughly constructed fire resisting buildings, serious loss may occur in any section of it occupied by the usual office or store fittings, or where goods of an inflammable nature are stored. The chief reliance, where such precautions as automatic sprinklers cannot be used, is to so construct our buildings as to confine the fire to some particular section or building, and to this end should our building laws and methods of building be directed.

It is almost useless for wealthy corporations to lead the way by erecting fire-proof buildings if the municipalities do not follow it up by compelling those erecting buildings in the same neighborhood to do likewise; one fire-proof building in a block of
