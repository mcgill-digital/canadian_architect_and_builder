<article title=" ARCHITECTURE AT THE R.C.A. EXHIBITION " author="">.



At the recent Royal Canadian Academy Exhibition in Toronto, there was shown a design for University Hall extension by Prof. S. H. Capper, F.R.I.B.A., R.C.A., of McGill University, Montreal ; a design for a bank, by Mr. A. T. Taylor, F.R.I.B.A., of Montreal; a sketch for Anglican church and competitive design for public school, by R. M. Fripp, F.R.I.B.A., of Vancouver, B. C.

Fire has destroyed the best part of the winter palace at Pekin, for ages the historic and sacred residence of the Chinese emperors, which, since the arrival of foreign troops in China, has been occupied as his headquarters by the German field marshal, Count von Waldersee, commander-in-chief of the allied forces in that country. Before the blaze had been discovered it had attained uncontrollable dimensions, and spread with great rapidity over the acre of buildings containing priceless art treasures.

The Hecla

Warm Air Furnace

Besides being constructed along the most approved lines and of the best materials, has features not found in any other furnace. 



Gas Tight and Dust Proof —There is no feature about a furnace which will appeal more strongly to an architect than this one. We have attained this end in the Hecla by the use of our PATENT FUSED JOINT. Instead of cementing and bolting the iron and steel together to make the dome, we make use of a patented method to fuse them together in such a way as to practically make a SINGLE CASTING. The joint is absolutely tight and cannot be separated unless it is cut apart.



Positive Conduction of Heat.—The Dome and Radiator are combined in such a way as to provide a triple radiation. It is so arranged that the heated air may be capped and positively conducted to any distant register.



Burns Any Kind of Fuel—The advantage of this need hardly be

mentioned. The Hecla will burn COAL, WOOD or PEAT. A special

wood grate is provided with each furnace.
