<article title="Wood in Artistic Work" author="">WOOD IN ARTISTIC WORK.

WOOD in artistic work is of prime service when of the right quality, flawless, and well seasoned. On this subject, a specialist writing in the Century points out some of the essentials called for, in particular that the material be white, free from gum, and soft also white for the contrasts that will be wanted and free from resin that it may not turn black with age. As it is the Fibre of the wood which is blackened or carbonized, it is obvious that the freer the wood is from gummy substances the better. The most satisfactory fire etching has been done on panels of white poplar, which is soft, white, close-grained and free from gum. Then, too, the common whitewood, or yellow poplar of America yields readily to treatment with the hot iron, and can be successfully used in conjunction with harder, rarer woods, becoming rich and solid under the touch of the burning tool. Beautiful results are obtained by thus combining the two opposite qualities and tones of different woods.
