NOTES.



It is said that Cape Breton Island possesses the greatest deposits of bialys at present known in the world. They are located in the Lake Ainslee district Inverness. Three properties are being worked, employing about 120 men, when running full time. A 400 foot bore hole, sunk in exploring for oil, showed the presence of barytes to that depth, and the deposit is practically inexhaustible. The Cape Breton Mining and Prospecting Company have recently acquired a number of properties in the Lake Ainslee district 



Potasiaite is a new explosive, perfected in MonLerey, Mex., and first used with success upon the construction of a Mexican Central Railroad branch with wonderful results, for it is pronounced safer, cheaper and more p powerful than dynamite. Those explosives based upon nitrogen produce a gas that necessitates abandoning closed works, such as mine or tunnel, during the explosion, and the laborers cannot return to work for a long time thereafter, depending upon the facility for carrying off the gas. Potasimite is said to produce no noxious gas, the only precaution necessary in its use being that the workmen get out of the way of the flying particles of blasted rock.
