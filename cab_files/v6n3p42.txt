14,905	pounds is the average crushing strength per  square inch of our Credit Valley Brown Stone.

The highest standard of test attained by any pure Sandstone in America.



IN confirmation of the facts above stated, we have pleasure in directing your attention to  the accompanying table, showing the result of the test of our stone, in connection with the series of tests of building stones conducted in 1892 at the School of Practical Science. Toronto, under the direction of a committee of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>

By referring to the results of the teats above mentioned, it will be seen that the average crushing stress of the majority of Canadian and American sandstones is far below that of ours, the difference in our favor ranging from 75 to 50 per cent.

The Credit Valley Brown Stone, owing to its modest lone, harmonizes beautifully With red or cream colored brick.
