center. This was treated as a center of travel in four directions. On either side of the entrance alcove is a bracket supporting two 16-c.p. lamps upright with refracting globes. The columns at the foot of the stairs carry a pair of brackets each supporting an upright 50 c.p. lamp in a 10 in: refracting globe. These are so located as to leave no dark corners in the hail and provide excellent illumination as far as the landing. At the opposite entrances to living and dining room are tour brackets each supporting three 4-c.p. frosted bulbs upright. Two of these brackets appear in Fig.

1.	The whole arrangement is designed to make convenient and agreeable the ordinary coming and going, receiving and Godspeeding, that make such a hail a center of every day interest and importance. incidentally some pleasing vistas are produced.

Living room. 30 ft x 16 ft. with large cased opening; treated practically as two rooms. Opposite entrance is a chandelier supporting five 16-c.p. frosted lamps in ornemental cut prismatic reflectors. One of these lights is pendant, producing good reading intensity near the center of the room. On both sides of the bay and cased opening are four ornamental brackets each carrying one 10-c.p. frosted lamp with a coated prismatic reflector. These provide comfortably distributed centres for reading or games. At the other end of the room are two corner brackets each supporting three 16-c.p. frosted lamps with coated reflectors, so located as to direct the illumination from a comfortable angle. A flush receptacle for a table lamp is also provided.

STUDY 15 ft. x 16 ft. This is really more of a den. Four pendant switches with 4 in. spherical 32 c. p. frosted lamps in prismatic reflectors, having a green tinted enamel coating, are used to provide a reading intensity and quality in thc four corners of the room, at the same time lighting up the face of the book cases and pictures with partially corrected light giving almost day-light color values.

BREAKFAST ROOM 10 ft. x 16 ft. A short chandelier carrying four pendant 10-c.p. Limps controlled by electrolier switch. One pair is equipped with concentrating reflectors and the other two with a distributing form, all being coated and partly tinted in green.

KITCHEN 16 ft. x i6 ft. One 32-c.p. partly frosted pendant 8 ft. above floor, with reflector giving strong and even illumination over entire room without eye strain, an important need in this place and one usually neglected. Over thc sink is a small bracket with upright 8-c.p. frosted lamp. Unshaded it lights the adjacent shelves, from which a reflector is conveniently taken and set over the tip without holder to produce a concentrated illumination for dish washing.

SIDE AND REAR ENTRANCES, ETC., are usually lighted with an 8-c.p. lamp placed high up with small concentrating reflectors giving a leading intensity in at least one spot and leaving an unobstructed passage way.



SECOND AND THIRD FLOORS.



MAIN Hall 18 ft. x 24 ft. In the center of this hall and over the open stairway is a wireless clustre pendant 6 ft. 6 in. above the second floor level. The center light is controlled by two 3-way switches independent of the rest which are used when general illumination of the upper hall and landing is required.

Bedrooms The bedrooms average about 16 ft. x

ft. and are in most cases equipped with two bracketed 16 c.p. frosted dresser lights having pink tinted and coated reflectors. 4-c.p. lamps are studded in ceiling of all closets with small concentrating reflectors and automatic door switches. In general, bedroom lighting should be local. If a bedroom is to have but one light., put it at one side of the dresser. If two lights, put one on each side. If three, the above arrangement is most useful. A third light over the dressing table is also useful for hair-dressing but not necessary.

BATHS. There are four baths 10 ft. x 10 ft. Each has a pair of 8-c.p. frosted lamps with close fitting prismatic reflectors placed to direct the light on the face for shaving. There is a comfortable difference between this arrangement and the strong reflection from the mirror itself when no reflectors are used. It is of interest to note that of the 175 lamps used there are 2 50-c.p., 19 32-c.p., 62 16-c.p., 23 10-c.p., 8-c.p., and 34 4-C.p.

It is necessary that these lamps shall be made for the actual voltage at the outlets in order to prevent considerable waste, and this voltage should he tested as soon as the service connection is made. Many of these lamps are frosted and some are ''reflector frosted" i.e. the tip half of the bulb is frosted.

The installation lacks interest in one particular, namely, that no gas outlets are provided. With the arrival of well designed fixtures for inverted gas burners, such an emergency service can be installed in a manner to satisfy any taste, and if equipped with the necessary color correcting globes these lights can also be used in conjunction with electric incandescent lamps.
