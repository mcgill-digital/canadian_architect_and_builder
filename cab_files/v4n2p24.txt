<assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.



A PAPER on "Building Material," which will be found in the March number of this journal, was read before this Club by Mr. <person>H. B. Gordon </person>on Tuesday evening, January 27th. After a vote of thanks had been tendered the lecturer, the competitive designs for a "Window in some Distinctive Style," were criticized by Mr. <person>Frank Darling</person>. Mr. <person>C. H. Acton Bond </person>was awarded first place in the senior division, and Mr<person>. J. G. S. Russell </person>in the junior division.

The subject of this competition had been suggested to the critic to induce the members to make a more thorough study of style, and the fact that a large number of the designs sent in shewed a striving after originality and prettiness of drawing rather than this, was somewhat disappointing. It is hoped in the next competition that style will receive more attention, and the detail will be clearly shown. The subject which has also been suggested by the critic is "A Mantel-piece in Stone or Marble," with special reference to style.

A novel feature was introduced into the Club's work on Tuesday, February 10th, when a debate was held on the following

Resolved "That an architect devote himself to the artistic entirely, and that construction should be relegated to engineers, as the present system of practice is detrimental to good architecture."

Messrs. <person>C. J. Gibson </person>and <person>A. H. Gregg </person>upheld the affirmative and brought forward many able arguments, conclusively showing that the work expected of an architect of the present day is so multifarious that it is impossible for one man to do it all as well as it should be done, and therefore a division of labor is necessary, such as we already find has taken place to a certain extent in the legal and medical professions, the proposal being that an architect should only know enough of the nature of materials and construction to enable him to design consistently, and that the rest of his time should be spent in the study of architecture as an art in all its branches, all scientific construction, plumbing, heating, etc., being handed over to an architectural engineer. Messrs. <firm>Gibson and Gregg </firm>deserve great credit for the thorough manner in which they worked up their subject, and the time evidently spent on it.

Mr. <person>J. A. Pearson </person>made a capital speech on the negative side, and brought out some strong points in a very vigorous manner, whilst the leader of this side, Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, in a long speech analyzed the various arguments brought forward, and taking a wide range, spoke of the subject generally, the chief argument of this side being that the word "entirely" coming in the resolution killed the arguments brought out by those on the opposite side, that an architect should know anything at all of the nature of materials or construction, and therefore their reasoning was not valid.

Mr. <person>Edmund Burke</person>, who had kindly consented to act as

Chairman for the evening, concurred in this literal interpretation

of the iesolution, and decided in favor of the negative.

It is intended that this shall only be the first of a series of debates to be held by the Club, and certainly if they all prove as interesting as this one, and members will take an active part in them, they ought to be of great benefit to all.

The classes in mathematics and construction conducted by Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, are now fairly started and promise to be very beneficial to those taking part. The average turn out up to the present has been fairly good, but certainly with the large number of names on the membership roll of the Club, there ought to be a considerable increase in the attendance now that all preliminary difficulties have been conquered.

At the regular meeting on Tuesday, 24th inst., Mr. <person>G. A. Reid</person>, R.C.A., will give a talk on "Architecture from an Artist's Standpoint'; and as this promises to be unusually interesting, those at all interested in the subject will be welcome visitors at the Club rooms on this occasion.





<article title=" COMPETITION FOR CHURCH DESIGNS " author="">COMPETITION FOR CHURCH DESIGNS.

WE should like to draw the attention of our readers to the Competition for Church Designs. The Committee of the Presbyterian Church which has the matter in hand, is desirous of having as many designs sent in as possible, and is prepared to publish all those of merit. The Committee does not expect that the three prizes which it has decided to give are sufficient inducement to competitors to send in designs, and it has only proposed to give these prizes as a small acknowledgement on its part of the obligation under which the Committee will be placed to those who may send in designs.

The Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>has undertaken to conduct the competition, because it believes that much benefit may result to the church architecture of the Province through the effort that is now being made by this denomination. There is no intention to publish any designs which may be submitted in a manner which will allow of their being used by any congregation which desires to erect a church, without employing the author. Only the perspective and the plans will be shown, with the object of 1st, giving examples of what is considered good ecclesiastical architecture by competent judges; and 2nd, to afford congregations proposing to build such information as will enable them to select. an architect capable of designing a church such as they may want, with some artistic excellence.

We omitted in the conditions of the proposed competition to state that designs should be sent in under mottos to the Registrar of the 0. A. A.

In the 4th class, the last clause "with vestry or school room" should read "with vestry and school room." Some competitors have asked for information as to the proper position of choir. As the competition is one which is for the purpose of securing good designs, both as to plan and exterior elevations, it was thought better not to hamper the competitors in any way. Each competitor will therefore place the choir in such position as he may deem will give the best results architecturally and at the same time fulfil the wants of a Presbyterian congregation.

It is hoped that many of the abler young men in the profession will take this opportunity to attempt to solve the problem of fulfilling the wants of a Presbyterian congregation, and at the same time designing a thoroughly ecclesiastical building.





<assoc>MONTREAL CONTRACTORS' ASSOCIATION</assoc>.

THE members of this Association wisely make use of the "dull season," between the close of business activity in the fall and its commencement in the spring, to cultivate a feeling of sociability which must greatly tend to secure union of interest and purpose. The custom of having a sleigh drive and banquet, which has prevailed for several years past, was adhered to this season.

A new departure made this year, however, took the shape of a trip to Boston, which was participated in. by Messrs. <person>E. A. Peel</person>, President; <person>W. Byrd</person>; ex-President; <person>Enoch Jones</person>, <person>Jas. Beckham</person>, <person>John Lee</person>, <person>J. W. Murray</person>, <person>Richard Ready</person>, and about twenty others. A day was pleasantly and profitably spent in inspecting the public buildings, parks, and other objects of interest in Boston.

The annual drive and banquet took place on the 4th inst., and was as usual a thoroughly enjoyable affair, the credit for which belongs to the Committee of Management Messrs. <person>J.

R.	Lavignac</person>, <person>L. Consineau</person>, <person>A. Valiquette</person>, <person>V. Bastien</person>, <person>T. H. McKenna</person>, <person>C. T. Charlebois</person>, <person>J. Lambert</person>, <person>J. Cochrane</person>, and <person>F. Fournier</person>. The company numbered 85, and occupie 32 sleighs.

The dinner, which was of excellent character, was presided over by the President-elect, Mr. <person>J. Brunet</person>, M. P. P. The usual loyal and patriotic toasts were duly honored. Mr. <person>J. R. Savignac </person>responded on behalf of Her Majesty the Queen. "Construction and its Interests" brought forth an appropriate response from Mr. <person>J. Consineau</person>. Speeches were also made by the President, and Messrs. <person>J. Cochrane</person>, <person>J. Lambert</person>, and <person>Aid. Lamarche</person>.
