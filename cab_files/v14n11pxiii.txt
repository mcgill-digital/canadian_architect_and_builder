"OSHAWA" STEEL SHINGLES

differ from other shingles in many respects.

Their superiority is shown by the demand for them

from all parts of the globe.

'Oshawa" Steel Shingles are locked Out all four

sides; a feature which no other steel shingle possesses.

They do away entirely with cleats, which experience has proven do not hold the sheets down firmly, and are always being opened up with sliding ice and snow.

locked shingles mean a big saving to you, as

they are cashier to apply than any other.

Once you've made the acquaintance of the Oshawa" Shingle you'll use no other. The reason is

very plain.

You will have a shingle that gives the most satisfactory results, and does away with the annoyances and complaints which follow the use of inferior goods.

Our catalogue gives fullest particulars. It's yours

for the asking.
