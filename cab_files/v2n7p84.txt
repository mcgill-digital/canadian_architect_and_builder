HEATING AND VENTILATION OF SCHOOLS.

T

HE following is taken from the Toronto Globe of June 21, and is from a report of the proceedings of the Toronto Public School Board of the evening before:

SMEAD-DOWD HEATING SYSTEM.

On the desks of the members were printed copies of the report of the deputation appointed by the Board at its meeting held March 6, 1889, to visit some of the principal cities of the United States with a view to gathering such information as would be helpful in the better construction, heating and ventilation of school buildings, and for the better arrangement and management of the schools. The report says the Committee visited the following cities in the order named Detroit, Toledo, Cleveland, Pittsburg, Allegheney City, Cincinnati, Washington,  Baltimore, Philadelphia, New York, Brooklyn, Jersey City, Albany, Troy, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buffalo, in the United States, and Hamilton, Canada.

The Committee, on reaching a city, sought out the officers of the Board of Public Instruction, and from them learned the location of six or eight of those they considered their best school buildings in point of construction, and the most perfect as to heating and ventilation.

Heating and ventilation, as perhaps the most important part of school construction, received most careful attention. Particular inquiries were made in this regard of the schools visited. The Committee asked what system of heating was in use, with a view to ascertaining how evenly the heat was distributed throughout the whole area of a class room, and how often the atmosphere was changed during a school session of an hour and a half. They took down the reading of the thermometer at the floor, ceiling, and midway between, and also measured with the anemometer the volume and velocity of the warm and fresh air at the intake, when there was any, and the foul air at the outlet.

The report of the Committee is comprehensive and takes in every part of school construction and management, and naturally considerable attention is paid in the report to heating and ventilation as follows

To gather information under this head, your Committee gave its very best attention, making careful examination and tests of the various systems. We found nearly all the cities in the same position, having a few years ago in a number of the schools substituted steam for stoves, while now they are substituting the Smead system for steam, New York and Brooklyn being the exceptions. Though these cities pride themselves in having (with their present mode of using steam apparatus) the best heated and ventilated schools on the continent, the result of our examination proved quite the reverse
