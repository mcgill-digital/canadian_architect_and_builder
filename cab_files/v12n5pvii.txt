must be moved by a force outside of itself, and the circulation of water, either hot or cold, is a mechanical operation and governed by mechanical laws. Heat is the sole cause of water circulation in lines of piping or radiation, as from it alone are the velocity and temperature of circulation started and maintained.

As something cannot be obtained from nothing,

neither can a circulation of water be increased either in velocity or heat after leaving the boiler from any cause in itself. As the current is started in the boiler, and by the construction of the boiler, and is through the boiler from bottom to top, as much water enters the boiler as is leaving it, and no more, whether the temperature entering is 40 degs. or 200 degs.
