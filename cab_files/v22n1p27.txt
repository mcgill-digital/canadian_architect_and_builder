In the opinion of Ernest Flagg, architect of the new Singer Building at New York, the tower of which is the highest building in the world for occupation, the probable limit of height for these buildings in New York City will be 1,000 feet, with a tower 100 feet square, or nearly 400 feet higher than the Singer Building, differing with the president of the New York fire underwriters, who recently warned the public that there was danger of a great conflagration in the upper stories of the tall 'buildings beyond the reach of existing fire-fighting apparatus. Mr. F1agg says that the only limit is financial practicability. He insists that buildings of the type

of the Singer are the safest, as regards a roof-top conflagration, because of the space about the tower, which occupies only one-sixth of the lot space. Were all the skyscrapers constructed with the same proportion of space around thc upper stories, he argues, the danger of a destructive fire in that upper region would be reduced to a minimum. Another point of limitation to which Mr. Flagg calls attention is 'the elevator service. He says one-haul elevators can bc constructed to cover 1,000 feet, but beyond that probably cannot be made effective. Those in the Singer Building are of a new type, known as traction elevators, with the weight at the bottom and the motor at the top. They will make the forty storey trip in a little less than one minute.
