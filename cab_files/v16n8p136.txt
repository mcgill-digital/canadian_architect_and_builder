NOTES.



The demand for hand-molded brick is increasing in the East. The machine-made brick now sells at from $6 to $7 per thousand white the hand-molded brick readily bring $10 a thousand. Many brick yards are adding to their hand-molding facilities. It is contended that machine-made brick chip easily at the corners and disintegrate more readily under the action of fire when used for furnaces and boiler linings than the hand-molded product. —Brick.
