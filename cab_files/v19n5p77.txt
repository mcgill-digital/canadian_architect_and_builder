sections, one of which consisted of only 4 inch brick; and on this four inch skin alone the floor joists rested. Having no bond or attachment to the other section it had buckled and peeled off. The floor strongly held together by the recent trussing sank 'en masse' and carried the lower floor with it. In making alterations

â€”even if they be all improvements upon an old building, one cannot be too careful; inherent faults of the above description do not reveal themselves to the most careful scrutiny.

	THE	<building>ALEXANBRA HOSPITAL</building>.



On Saturday , 5th May , the members visited the Alexandra Hospital for contagious diseases at Point St. Charles. Mr. <person>W. S. Maxwell </person>kindly conducted the party through the buildings, which were at the time just on the point of completion. The building-s generally are of plastic brick with a few Roman stone dressings. The floors are concrete on steel and all corridors of communication are similarly concrete in floors, walls and roofs. Three blocks, for different diseases, radiate from the central administrative

building in which is placed a main kitchen surrounded by a corridor where attendants have the meals passed out to them for distribution to the various departments. In this way the attendants do not enter the kitchen or come in contact with one another. The wards are reached by cross ventilated inclined passages up and down. The floors of the wards are of cement concrete in slabs. The doors are flush, veneered with varnished gum wood. At the end of each ward is a large glass enclosed verandah. The windows generally are balance weight sashes with hinged fanlight at top. The laundry is in a separate building. Another contains stable, coach house, mortuary and mortuary chapel. The sewage is disinfected with chemicals before being run into the city sewers. The nurse accommodation is on the third floor at that end of the ward buildings which is nearest to the administrative building. The nurses for each disease do not come in contact with those attending on patients suffering from another sickness.
