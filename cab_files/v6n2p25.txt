The sum of $235.30 has been spent in the purchase of hooks $584.05 in 1891, and $51.25 in 1892.

The Library was opened for lending on October 1st. 1891. Since that time there have been 203 books borrowed; 31 in 1891, 157 in 1892, and 15 in January of the present year. Of the 203 borrowings, 31 were by architects, and 172 by students.



On motion of Mr. <person>Burke, </person>seconded by Mr. <person>Belcher</person>, the report of the Treasurer was adopted.

On motion by Mr. <person>Gemmell</person>, seconded by Mr. <person>Edwards</person>, the report of the Registrar and Librarian was adopted.

The Convention then proceeded to the consideration of "Business arising out of the minutes."

DISCUSSION.

Mr. Edwards called attention to the desirability of having the "Conditions of Competition " printed and circulated among the members of the Association, so that they might he in a position at any time when called upon to hand those Conditions to persons seeking competition. He would, if necessary, move that the Conditions be printed, though it was merely a suggestion on his part, as he recognized that it was the work of the Council.

The President replied that although the action to be taken was a matter for the Council, it was within the province of the members assembled in convention to instruct the Council to take any steps thought advisable.

Mr. Edwards: Then I will move that the "Conditions of Competition" be printed and circulated among the members of the Association.

Mr. <person>Helliwell, </person>in seconding Mr. Edwards' motion, stated that there was much force in that gentleman's arguments as to the importance of having the Conditions of Competition printed, not merely for the reason given, but also that the matter might be kept before members themselves. While speaking of printing, he desired to bear testimony to the great advantage of having the various reports printed and placed in the hands of members attending the Convention, as had been done on the present occasion, as it enabled them to follow and discuss the matters in question more intelligently than would otherwise be the case. He thought the slight expenditure this incurred was a very wise one.

Mr. <person>Wickson</person> inquired if another benefit arising from the printing of the Conditions would not be that members who were approached and asked to submit competitive sketches would find it a very easy and concise method of replying, to forward the printed Conditions to such applicants, stating that tinder those Conditions only, they submitted competitive drawings.

Mr. <person>Gordon</person> thought the proposed action of printing and circulating the Conditions would have a valuable educational effect.

Mr. Burke believed that not only the public, but some of the members, would derive an educational benefit from the perusal of the Conditions, if printed and circulated as proposed.

Mr. Edwards expressed his gratification at finding his views so generally endorsed, and his ideas elaborated upon by the members present. lie thought what had been said covered the ground admirably.

The President I certainly think it would be a decided advantage to have the Conditions of Competition printed as has been suggested. I may say the only reason they have not been printed is, that the Council, having received a petition to reduce the fees, felt that for the remainder of the year it would be well to conduct the affairs of the Association as economically as possible, and meanwhile to ascertain what was really the feeling of the Association with regard to expenditure. it is, of course, impossible to go on making expenditures unless we have an income. As far as the surplus is concerned, it will not be difficult to dispose of that, but at the same time, I think we should make our income and our expenditure as nearly equal as we can.

The President then put Mr. Edwards' motion to the convention.

Mr. Edwards suggested that sufficient copies be printed to enable a few copies to be in the hands of every member.

Mr<person> Simpson</person> thought it would be well to have printed on the same sheet the scale of architects' fees.

The President said that there was no tariff adopted by the Association.

The motion was then carried.

THE LIBRARY.

Mr. <person>Aylesworth</person>, referring to the advisability of reducing expenditure, said he had been stick by the idea that the money expended on the library might not perhaps be well applied. For his own part, while aware of its existence, he did not know where it was, or of what it consisted, and he wondered to what extent it was known of by other members. If it was not of any particular advantage, was it well to continue to expend money on it in the meantime?

The President : The meaning of the last speaker, to me, is not very plain. The announcement of the library's existence has

been placed in the hands of every member, with information as to the conditions, etc., on which books can be obtained. While perhaps not in constant use for purposes of reference, the library certainly has been made use of in that way to some extent. The only trouble is that it is in need of improvement to be of advantage to members, its advantages at present being almost entirely confined to students preparing for examinations. What I, for one, would advocate is the application of a portion of our stir-plus to the purchase of books of greater value to members of the Association. I may say that every member of the Association, no matter where he resides, can have any book sent to him, and is allowed to keep it for a certain length of time, the only obligation cast upon him being to pay the postage and preserve the book in proper condition.

Mr. Aylesworth : What I meant to say was, that so far I have not looked up the library, and I under stood from others that they were in the same position ; and I did not know whether it had been of service to anyone. There are a number of valuable books both in the School of Practical Science and in the Public Library, but how many of them are being used? If they are not used, our small library would be less made use of, and if it is not of practical benefit, why should we continue to expend money on it? Of course, if it is being made use of, well and good, and if additions to it will enhance its value, it is merely a question of how useful it will be.

Mr. <person>Gordon</person>: If I may criticize in any way the financial aspect of this matter, I would say that I cannot see the wisdom of having $2,000 odd lying in the bank, when a portion of it might be much better utilized in procuring for the library works which might be looked at by architects with advantage. While it is true Toronto members have access to the Public Library and other collections, certainly those residing in the country should he very anxious for the improvement of the library, and I may say, speaking of my firm that we have occasionally made use of the Association Library, and I think the city members should also be anxious to increase its efficiency. I think we should instruct the Council for the coming year to expend more money upon this library, and, if a motion were in order, or necessary, I would move that the Association, recognizing the desirability of increasing the efficiency of the library, recommends the Council to make such judicious expenditure of the moneys in their hands as may to them seem advisable to that end.

Mr. <person>N. B. Dick</person>: I do not quite agree with what Mr. Gordon says about increasing the expenditure. I am not one of the forty-nine kickers against paying fees, but it is evident from the results (If high fees that we are diminishing our membership, and I think we ought to move in the direction of reducing expenses, for that seems to be the trouble with many of the outside members, and, indeed, many in our own city. It seen is to me that the expenses of the Association have been unnecessarily large. I think something may be (lone in the way of reducing the expenses of meetings of the Council. I hardly see the necessity of bringing in members from a distance to consult on matters of minor importance and paying their railway and travelling expenses. I think most members of the Association will be satisfied to appoint men in Toronto, or in some other city. Then I would like to ask what the expenses are in connection with students? There is an item of, I think, $250 in connection with the examination. Are examiners paid for their services?

The President : Yes.

Mr. Dick : Don't you think members of this Association ought to take sufficient interest in its affairs to be willing to give their necessary time gratuitously? Let us cut down expenses in that way. (Hear, hear.) I know, for my own part, though I fear my usefulness would not be great, that I should be very glad to do anything I could without remuneration. While I am not sufficiently conversant with the matter to enter into its minute, I believe it would be possible to reduce our expenses by one half, and thus not only retain our present membership, but add to it, instead of having it decrease from year to year.

The Registrar: I think I had better explain to Mr. Dick that the amount of labor involved in connection with the examinations is very great, and means a great deal more than a few days' attendance here. There was at first the arranging of the curriculum, then setting papers and attendance during the examination, afterwards the labor of examining the papers. The fee of each examiner was $25, for which some of them examined on four or five subjects. That sum is entirely out of proportion to the fees paid to an examiner in the School of Practical Science or the University, and, as far as being any adequate return for the services rendered in connection with the examinations, might almost as well he dispensed with, but I think it would be most unreasonable to expect four or five members to do all this work for the whole Association for nothing, and also, if the examiners are paid, it establishes better tile business character of the examinations and the responsibility of the examiners to the Association. Some other way out of the difficulty must be found. A proper way would be to increase the charge to students, but that is a matter for future consideration.

Mr. Edwards called the attention of the chairman In the fact that proceedings were becoming somewhat irregular, there being two subjects under discussion at one time, tile reduction of fees and the augmentation, or otherwise, of the library.

The President, while admitting the discussion to be slightly irregular, thought it would do no harm, as the matters under
