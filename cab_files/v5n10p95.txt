THE next convention of the <assoc>American Institute of Architects </assoc>will take place at Chicago on the 20th and 21st inst., coincident with the inaugural exercises of the World's Columbian Exposition.





THE demands upon our space this month preclude the publication in this number of more than one of the instructive papers read at the recent convention of the Province of Quebec Association of Architects. We hope to be able to present the others in our November number.



THE architects of the Province of Quebec are complaining of the action of the Provincial Government in imposing upon them a professional tax, thus placing them on the same footing as lawyers and doctors, while at the same time refusing to their Association the rights and privileges accorded to the other professions. They rightly object to being recognized as a profession for taxation purposes only.



THE concrete floors in the new <building>Royal Victoria Hospital, Montreal</building>, although as yet subject to no wear, are full of holes, and will probably have to be replaced by something more substantial, such as granolithic. The difficulty appears to be that the concrete is too rich, and the layer is of two great depth. A very coarse grade of sand is required to make good concrete, and this cannot be obtained in the vicinity of Montreal.





THE burden of taxation imposed upon manufacturers, resulted a few years ago in the removal of a number of factories from Toronto to suburban towns and villages. One of the greatest needs of the city to-day is a greater number of manufacturing industries affording employment to the artisan class. It is hoped that the by-law under which manufacturing plant will hereafter be exempt from taxation, will induce manufacturers to locate in a city which has many other advantages to offer.





THE severity of the climate in winter in the Province of Quebec, calls for certain distinctive requirements in the construction of buildings, especially residences, to ensure the stability of the structures and the comfort of the inmates. For example, a double roof has been found to be an essential in house construction. With a single roof, the snow, which there falls in such abundance, would melt and cover the roof and sides of the house with ice. To avoid this, the roof is made double, with an air space between. Thus the upper roof receives no warmth, and the snow usually, crisp and dry, instead of being melted, is constantly blown away by the wind.





SEPTEMBER 30th was the date set for the close of the preliminary competition for designs for new the public buildings which are proposed to be erected at Victoria, B. C. All the designs received will be submitted to two non-Competing architects, who, in conjunction with the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works, will advise which five designs shall be selected for a final competition, and in the final competition, which design, in their opinion, should be placed first, the author of which will then be entrusted with such portions of the works as the government may decide to proceed with, on the usual terms. The authors of the five designs selected for the final competition will be paid an honorarium each of $750. The cost of the building must not exceed within ten per cent., the sum of $500,000.





SEVERAL boiler explosions, attended with disastrous results to property and human life, have recently taken place in various parts of Canada. The most recent accident of this nature occurred a few days ago in the basement of-one of the large bust-ness buildings in Hamilton. One of the large boilers used for heating the building exploded, wrecking a second boiler and setting fire to the premises. The fire department fortunately succeeded in putting the fire out. The boiler must have exploded under a very low pressure of steam, otherwise the results would certainly have been more serious. Occurrences of this kind emphasize the need for a higher standard of proficiency on the part of persons entrusted with the care of steam plants. Steam boilers in the hands of incompetent persons are almost
