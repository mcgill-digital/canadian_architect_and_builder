Vol. XII. ]                    Canadian Archit

Section Tintern Abbey West Door

Notes: The Diaper work is only half finished and bears traces of colour- (red). There are traces of plaster and fresco work in the niches at sides, which accounts for the roughness and uneven jointing of the stone work there. The shafts in all cases have disappeared and bases are much damaged, also pedestals in niches at sides. Among the ruins of the Abbey are the remains of a statue which appears to have been that of a madonna and child â€“ it is about the size of the centre niche and may at one time have been there. The niche is half filled up with loose stones and only half of the carved pedestal exists.
