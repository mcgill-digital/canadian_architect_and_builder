Bookkeeping for Joist STOCK Companies.- A practical and comprehensive treatise on the organization forms and bookkeeping entries required to meet the varying conditions of Joint Stock Companies of all kinds, together with an analysis of the Dominion and Ontario Acts governing such corporation, by David Hoskins, Chartered Accountant, Principal of British American Business College, Toronto, and Vice-President of the institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. Published by the Federated Business Colleges of Ontario, Limited, Toronto, Price, $1.50.

The author of this work has, we are pleased to see, avoided the error into which most writers of bookkeeping texts have fallen, namely, that of arranging the matter in such a way as to necessitate a large amount of mechanical work being performed



before any practical benefits can be obtained; on the contrary, his explanations are so clear and concise and so excellently indexed that the busiest of men can obtain full information on any of the many technical points of joint stuck company bookkeeping or law, in a surprisingly short time. The whole subject has been treated in a thoroughly practical and business-like manner and shows a masterful grasp of the entire range of Company accounting. The chapters dealing with the Conversion of business concerns into Limited companies and the Amalgamation of Companies are particularly good ones, while the many illustrations of Financial Statements used by the leading Canadian mercantile and manufacturing institutions cannot fail to be of great value both to the business man and the accountancy student. A first-class idea, in this book is that of including the questions set on the examinations of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Ontario. Mr. Hoskins is to be congratulated on his important addition to accountancy literature 











If you are looking for a high grade Finish for Floors

Granitine Floor Finish

Is unsurpassed in Durability and Beauty of Finish for Natural Wood and Parquette Floors, Linoleums, Oil Cloth, Cork Matting, &c.

Its transparency reveals the grain of the wood, and its preserving qualities increase the life of the floor.

Its sanitary properties are highly commended, as it closes thoroughly the pores of the wood against disease germs, and permits the floor to be kept thoroughly clean.

It is easier applied, more durable, makes better finish than wax preparations, and is free from all unpleasant slipperiness.



Moving furniture or boot heels do not leave white mark'- nor does soap, mud or water destroy its fine appearance.
