OF ONTARIO.

The annual convention of the Association held at Guelph on Good Friday is considered to have been the most successful from the standpoint of a large attendance and sustained interest of any within the history of the organization. The fact of the meeting having been called on a public holiday when cheap railway fares were available, doubtless contributed to this result.

The delegates from all parts of the Province were extended a civic welcome by Ald. J. M. Struthers, while the Taylor Forbes Co., Guelph Foundry Co., the Page Mersey Co., and the local manufacturing concerns co-operated with the local plumbers in making the visit enjoyable.

A conference was held between the members of the Association and representatives of the supply houses touching matters affecting the trade. The opinion has been expressed by some members of the Executive that in the future the conferences should be public, as are the meetings of the Association proper, thereby leaving no room for the suspicion that there is anything unfair in the methods of the organization, which are stated to be such as will bear the fullest investigation.

One of the most important results of the convention was the appointment of a Committee to draft a uniform Sanitary By-law to be submitted for adoption to all cities and towns in the province operating sewerage systems. The Toronto Plumbing Ordinance as amended March, 1896, will probably form the basis for the

new measure, but an effort will be made to improve upon this ordinance, which in some important particulars is felt to be defective, and unfair to plumbers. It is contended that all plumbers should not only be licensed but placed under bonds to make good any defects in their work. If this were done, it is urged that the plumbers should be given entire charge of the construction of the plumbing and drainage system both inside and outside the building as far as the street connections. In Toronto the plumber is held responsible for any leak which may develope in the drains notwithstanding that these are often put in by unskilled labor and are outside the plumbers' contract.

The Committee charged with the preparation of this proposed uniform Sanitary By-law is composed as follows :—Messrs. F. Armstrong, L. LeGrow, G. H. Cooper and J. H. Wilson, Toronto; B. Noble, London; H. A. Knox, Ottawa; W. Stephenson, Guelph.

Delegates were appointed to the convention of the National Association, which will be held in Atlanta, Ga., in June, as follows: F. Armstrong, Toronto; W.

J. Walsh, Hamilton.

Messrs. John McKinley, Ottawa, and B. Noble, London, were appointed delegates to attend the meeting of the National Association of Steam Fitters, at Atlantic City, N.J., in June.

The following officers were elected for the ensuing year:

Past President—W. Mansell, Toronto.

President—W. J. Walsh, Hamilton.

Vice-President—H. Mahoney, Guelph.

Financial Secretary—T. H. Davies, Hamilton.

Secretary—W. H. Meredith, Toronto.

Treasurer— J. H. Wilson, Toronto.

Executive Committee—Messrs. E. H. Russell, London; H. A. Knox, Ottawa; A. Riddel, St. Catharines.

A very enjoyable dinner at the Wellington Hotel brought the convention to a close. Mr. Mahoney ably fulfilled the duties of Chairman and toastmaster.

In addition to the usual patriotic toasts, the following were honored :—" The Architects," proposed by

R. Harriston, responded to by Mr. W. A. Mahoney. "Manufacturers and Supplymen," by. F. Armstrong; responded to by Messrs. J. M. Taylor, C. L. Dunar and C. Near. " Sister Associations," proposed by Mr. W. Stevenson ; responded to by Messrs. W. Walsh, E. Russell and E. E. P. Brain. "The Press" and "The Ladies."





<article title=" A FEW HIGH STRUCTURES." author="">A FEW HIGH STRUCTURES.

The tallest structure in the world to-day is the Eiffel tower, built for exhibition purposes at the Paris Exposition, with a height of 984 feet. Of enduring structures, the Washington monument stands at the head with its feet of solid masonry.

The famous Cologne Cathedral comes next. It is 512 feet high, and built of stone to last centuries. Next in rank, Egypt's great pyramid at Ghizah, the wonder of all ages, stands a monument to the art of ancient builders. Though the beautiful slabs of white marble, which in the time of the Pharaohs lined its sides, have been stolen, and its tombs have been discovered and stripped, the great monument stands as solid and high as ever. It is claimed that evidence has been discovered that this pyramid was constructed by Noah, builder of the Ark. The pyramid is 485 feet high.
