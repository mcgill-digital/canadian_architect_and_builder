(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCIHTECT AND BUILDER





SINCE my last report, owing to the cold weather having set in rather



severely, all building operations have been suspended, but as there are quite a number of buildings yet unfinished, on resuming work there will be plenty of employment for all until the new spring business comes on. As yet it is impossible to form any idea as to the extent of the spring operations, for as a general rule, parties intending to build either in spring or fall, do not place their orders in the hands of the architects until the season is well advanced, and then all is hurry and rush to get the plans prepared and the contracts let, so that the building will be completed on a certain date, and in most all cases, the time allowed is unreasonably limited 

This is certainly not a prudent way of doing business, and is disadvantageous to all parties concerned. The architect has not the proper time to mature his plans. The proprietor in his limited decision, requires alterations and extras; and the contractor being so bound up to time, cannot execute the work in as good a manner as if a reasonable contract time was allowed. This has always been a general cause of complaint among architects and contractors, and one which it would benefit the parties most concerned to seek to have remedied. I have nothing to report from the Building Inspector's book, as there have been no new entries made. But I am glad to be informed that owing to very frequent complaints having been made, there will be proper attention paid in future to having all new buildings properly recorded.

The hot air furnace is rapidly taking the place of the heating stoves in the dwelling houses now erected. This is probably a step in the right direction, providing careful attention is paid to ventilation. Here lies the great danger, for where the house is heated with hot air, the stove pipe holes, when such exist, may be closed, and the fire place covered up, leaving no exit for the vitiated air. Of course proper expert attention to ventilating and heating will obviate all danger, but it can be plainly seen in many instances where furnaces have been introduced, that expert care in this direction has not been used.

T

HE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER in its new robes must have been a pleasure to its numerous subscribers and readers. It is to be hoped that with the commencement of the third volume still greater improvements will be made. This can only be accomplished by the architects and builders throughout the Dominion taking a lively interest in its welfare, and endeavoring to advance its interests in every way possible.

On the evening of January 15th the architects of Ottawa held a meeting for the consideration and adoption of the constitution and by-laws of the proposed <assoc>Ottawa Institute of Architects</assoc>. After having been carefully read over, and some alterations made, they were finally adopted. Eighteen architects signed the members' roll binding themselves to faithfully adhere to the constitution and by-la s of the Institute. The election of officers was then proceeded with, and resulted as follows :—President, <person>Thos. Fuller</person>; Vice-President, <person>King Arnoldi</person>; Secretary, <person>A. M. Calderon</person>; Treasurer,

<person>J.R. Bowes</person>; Executive Council, <person>H. H. Horsey</person>, <person>D. Ewart</person>, K. Arnoldi, <person>R. Surtees</person>, J. R. Bowes, <person>A. F. Alexander </person>and A. M. Calderon. The Association meets monthly, when questions relating to the interests and advancement of the profession will be discussed. The architects consider they have accomplished a great deal in thus being organized, and each individual member expects to derive a great deal of benefit from the institution. It is also proposed to submit differences between architects and contractors to the Institute for adjudication, if such arrangement can be made with the contractors, as a great deal of unnecessary legal expense may thus be saved. It is to be hoped the architects of other cities in the Province will form similar organizations and all become affiliated. If this is done, there is no reason why an Act of Incorporation should not be granted at the next session of the Ontario Legislature, as the Hon. Mr. <person>Ross, Minister of Education</person>, is favorable to the idea. It is to be hoped that through the columns of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, you will make every effort to have the Association formed and a charter granted as soon as possible. I have no doubt but that the Secretary of the Ottawa Institute would be happy to furnish a printed copy of the constitution and by-laws to any architect applying to him.

It is gratifying to learn that the difficulty between the architects and builders of London, in regard to the form of contract, has been amicably settled. There is no reason why an uniform contract should not be adopted by the architects and contractors throughout the Province. This is one of the points that could be arranged if an Architectural Association was in existence. A contract, drawn up by a joint Committee of Builders of the National Association of Builders of the United States and Committees of the American Institute of Architects and the Western Association of Architects is now being almost exclusively used by the American architects and builders, and seems to give general satisfaction.

About fifty members of the Contractors' Union, of Montreal paid Ottawa a visit recently. They were met at the station by the Mayor and principal contractors and driven to the Grand Union Hotel, where they were presented with an address by the Mayor, and granting them the freedom of the city. They were afterwards tendered a banquet by the city contractors,

the Mayor presiding. The Ottawa contractors are discussing the advisability of forming a similar Union.

Very little work has been let out as yet for 1889. <person>F. Alexander</person>, architect, has let contracts for a brick residence for <person>Alderman Stroud, </person>to cost $7,000; <firm>Arnoldi & Calderon, architects</firm>,. have let contracts for a <building>Bank of Ottawa building </building>at Carleton Place, to cost $13,000; <person>J. R. Bowes</person>, architect, has let contracts for a free stone residence for <person>N. Charlebois</person>, to cost $12,200; the congregation of the <building>Dominion Methodist Church </building>are receiving tenders for a lecture hall to cost about $12,000.

The architects appear to have plenty of work on the tables, and anticipate a brisk season, but clients are slow in getting the work let out.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



HERE is very little to report in the way of building transactions. Things architectural may possibly boom in the spring, but at present

there is little sign of activity. Architects, contractors, and the public at large, suffer from the annual "corner" in bricks, and no one is inclined to build until the quotations for summer brick are out.

There is a tremendous rush to finish the numerous gigantic piles of offices which have been in course of erection during the past year in time for the fated 1st of May.

Mr. <person>W. T. Thomas </person>is engaged on plans for a mansion for Mr. <person>Duncan McIntyre</person>, which will be commenced this summer.

A new Methodist Church is to  be erected in St. Gabriel village on Wellington St., from designs by Mr. <person>W. McLea Walbank</person>. It is intended to commence operations at once.

A temporary architectural furore was caused by the designs sent in for Messrs. <firm>Morgan & Co.'s </firm>colossal establishment up-town on St. Catharines St. Ten designs were sent in, and it is a pity the public will not be allowed to judge of their merits by their being publicly exhibited. As it was, the unsuccessful competitors had their plans promptly returned without note or comment, the design of Mr. <person>J. P. Hill </person>being selected. The buildings will cost approximately $150,000. and be completed by May 1st 1891.

Apropos of the above I enclose you my opinion of corn petitions generally, having through dearth of prose matter (like Mr. <person>Silas Wegg</person>) "dropped into poetry,' as follows:

An architect sat in his old arm chair—

 T square and drawing board both were there 

With "Whatman's Imperial" mounted with care 

He was equally ready to do or dare,

But he rubbed his knee

As he sighed "ah me!

What Sort of a job will my next one be?

(Reads advertisement.)

"Be it known to all whom it may concern

That the worshipful Borough of "Butter-on-the-Burn" 

Three prizes will give for designs for a churn."

"What the deuce do they want with a churn ?' quoth he.

Now I'm all up a tree,

(For between you and me),

A churn in full action I never did see!"

An  "ancient example" he anxiously sought,

And by his office boy neatly was caught

In making a copy of something he thought

Was genuine classic. "Hello! may be 

This will suit to a T

(Tho' between you and me)

It's meant for a well with a windlass,' quoth he.



Elevations he hasteneth now to prepare,

A perspective he etcheth, as much as he dare

A specification he copieth fair;

And he slappeth his knee,

And he crieth with glee,

"Now I'm certainly sure to be one of the three!"

(Reads letter.)

For weeks he waiteth—no news can he gain —

"No news is good news,' he quoteth in vain, 

Till the following drives him completely insane



"Dear Sir: We herewith return your drawing, 

For we found if we kept on much longer see-sawing,

 We somehow might possibly get into lawing— 

After getting as pretty well mixed up as mortar.

We withold the prizes—

 Though all shapes and sizes,

Not one of your churns will make butter out of water !!"

It is computed that if one horse can draw a certain load over a level road on iron rails, it will take 1 2/3 horses to draw the same load on asphalt, 3 1/3 horses to draw it on the best Belgian block, 5 on the ordinary Belgian pavement, 7 on good cobblestones, 13 on bad cobblestones, 20 on an ordinary earth road, and 40 on a sandy road.
