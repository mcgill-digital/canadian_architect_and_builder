Mr. <person>A. H. Leake</person>, inspector of manual training in schools, is making a lecturing tour, under arrangements made by the Education Department, with a view to impressing upon the public the importance of technical education. His lectures are illustrated by fine stereopticon views, including a series showing the classes at work in the famous Technical High School of Tokio, Japan. These lectures are given at any place to which the School Board invites Mr. Leake, the only cost of them being that of providing a suitable hail. The interest aroused by the plan is evidenced by the fact that Mr. Leake is booked for almost every week right up to the end of May.
