THE painters' strike at Winnipeg, referred to in our last issue, is ended. The strikers have returned to work at the old rate of

wages.	_____________





THE United States Customs regulations require that to each invoice of granite exported to the States, there must- he attached a diagram of each piece so exported and a sworn Statement of the value. Enquiries are being made at Ottawa with the view to ascertain what method is employed by Canadian Customs officials to ascertain the value of manufactured granite exported by Great Britain and the United States to Canada.



THE brick manufacturers in Toronto and vicinity have organized an association, and have decided to reduce the scale of wages paid to employees. This action has been promptly followed by the organization of a brickmakers' union, and a determination on the part of the employees to submit to no reduction. The surplus stocks on hand are so large, and the building outlook so unpromising, that some of the manufacturers decided a month or two ago not to operate their yards this season. Under these circumstances, the probabilities are decidedly adverse to any satisfactory results being obtained from a strike of employees at this time.





AN effort will be made at the next session of the Ontario Legislature to have the Mechanics' Lien Act amended in several important particulars. At a recent meeting of representatives of the Toronto Builders' Exchange, Trades and Labor Council, and material supply men of Toronto, this subject underwent discussion. A committee was appointed to draft required amendments to this Act and submit the same for consideration at a future meeting. The discussion brought out the fact that the lien law of Ontario affords less protection to mechanics and persons supplying materials, than laws existing for the same object in many of the States of the Union.



<assoc>THE Toronto Architectural Sketch Club </assoc>might profitably follow the custom of English Architectural Societies in visiting in a body as frequently as possible during each summer buildings in course of erection, previously arranging with the architects of the building to be present to explain the points of interest connected with the construction. It is safe to say that one such visit may be the means of affording students more practical instruction than could be obtained from half a dozen lectures. A visit of this character was made to the <building>Hospital for Sick Children Toronto</building>on College street, and proved to be of great interest and value. It is to be hoped that a series of similar visits will be arranged for the present summer.



REFERENCE has often been made to the unfairness and sometimes time absurdness of the conditions of architectural competitions. The evil has possibly reached its limit so far as its effects upon architects is concerned. It seems, however, to be now trying to find its way into the engineering profession. The following advertisement recently appeared in the daily papers

"The town of contemplates the construction of waterworks this year, and invites tenders, to be opened 30th inst. Those tendering to finish their own plans and specifications at their own expense. The lowest or any tender not necessarily accepted. For particulars communicate with ." The above is so palpably a case of "heads I win, tails you lose," that we may presume no engineer will be so foolish as to enter the game.



THE question as to who shall fill the position of City Clerk of Montreal, has not at the time of going to press been absolutely decided, but there is very little doubt that Mr. <person>L. O. David </person>will be <person>Mr. Glackmeyer</person>'s successor. He was nominated by the Finance Committee, and in all probability the matter will be decided at the next meeting of the Council. Mr. L. O. David is by no means an unknown man. He has been a prominent figure before the Montreal public for many years, having occupied platform after platform in the interests of the French-Canadian element of the population of the Dominion. He has not heretofore occupied any civic position, but his recommendation by the Finance Committee augurs well for his success in a post of such importance as that of City Clerk of Montreal.
