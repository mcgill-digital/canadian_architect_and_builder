ever, will give the operator an idea of how the figures are applied. Let us suppose we want a " mitre-cut" for a nonagon or nine-sided figure Find the figure 9 on the outside of the circle, and following the line inside, we find the figures 22 1/2 and 9. These figures indicate that we are to take 9 inches on the tongue and 22'2 inches on the blade lay on a line same as for braces or raftersâ€”mark down the tongue; this line will be the bevel or mitre for the angle of a nonagon. Try it by cutting nine pieces of stuff all the same length at the long points, using this bevel at each end. In like manner all the other bevels are obtained. We recapitulate the figures and polygons

In addition to the business programme, the local association is making arrangements to give delegates a most hospitable reception to the Ancient City. With this object a number of excursions to interesting points in and around the city have been planned, and special care will be taken for the pleasure and comfort of the ladies who may accompany the delegates to the meeting. The local committee who have these matters in hand is composed of Messrs. R. Sampson, C. E. Pickard, A. Forest and W. H. Wiggs.

DOMINION PLUMBERS' CONVENTION.

ARRANGEMENTS for the third annual convention of the National Association of Master Plumbers, Gas, Steam and Hot Water Fitters of Canada, to be held in Quebec from the 29th inst. to the 1st of July inclusive, are nearing completion. The headquarters of the Association during the convention will be at the Victoria Hotel, where the business sessions will be held. The programme which is being arranged for the occasion is designed to afford both profit and pleasure to the delegates. It might be well just here to mention that the convention is not intended to be one for delegates only, but is open to every one who is a master plumber, gas, steam or hot water fitter, and no one will be held by any action to be taken unless he is or becomes a member.

For the benefit of those who are not familiar with the present workings of the association we will state that about two years ago the men who directed its affairs, with the object of protecting the interests of the contracting plumber and fitter, adopted in July, 1896, certain "Trade Resolutions," which have received the assent of the Manufacturers' Supply Association, and

while on a visit to the Pacific Coast last month, brought about the organization of Master Plumbers' Association at Vancouver, and it is understood that a representative of this new association will attend the Quebec convention.

Arrangements have been made with the railways for return tickets to delegates at one and one-third fare, on the certificate plan. Those not acquainted with the certificate plan should at once write the secretary of the association, Mr. Win. Mansell, Adelaide street west, Toronto, for particulars.
