Boston, it is alleged, is indulging in the elevator girl. It is time o call halt, says the Baltimore Builders Journal. We

are taking too many risks. We do not question the willingness nor the intelligence of the girls who may run elevators, but we should have neither elevator girls or boys. We should have men, and good robust men at that. In case of accident or fire a great deal depends upon the courage and strength of the person in charge of the elevator.
