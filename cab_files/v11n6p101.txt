THE Timberman, of Chicago, contends

The Use of

	Shingles,	that the quantity of shingles used now-

		adays is larger in proportion to the use



of lumber than it ever was before. Two reasons are given for this one that there is more brick used in the construction of buildings than formerly, without any corresponding decrease in the number of shingles required ; and the other that the life of shingles at the present time is not as long as it used to be. [t is not an easy matter to advance an apparently correct theory why the lifetime of shingles has become so much shorter. It is claimed by some to be due to the use of the steel wire nail, which will not resist the elements for more than about ten years, while the shingled roof was, in earlier days, expected to last twenty-five years.



The Dominion Heating Supply Association  THE article headed as above which appeared in the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER

	for May has given rise to considerable



discussion among the members of the Dominion Plumbers' Association. The sentiments expressed therein by a member of the Dominion Heating and Plumbing Supply Association are clearly not entertained by the management, as witness their repudiation by the vice-president and a member of the Executive in our Correspondence Department. It may be well that we should state that the views were only those of an individual member of the association not of the association. As such they were published. Hence they should not be looked on as being in any sense official, nor should an attempt be made to place responsibility for them on the shoulders of the officials of the Dominion Heating and Supply Association. It is a matter of regret to us that the publication of the article in question seems to have had a tendency to disturb the pleasant relations which have and should exist between the plumbers and supply companies.
