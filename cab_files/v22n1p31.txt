<article title=" MONTREAL REAL ESTATE " author="">MONTREAL REAL ESTATE.

One of the most attractive investment channels in Montreal during the past few years ha been real estate. Everywhere agents are reporting on its increase. Tile suburban development has in particular been rapid and remarkable Grounds and farms. which only recently were considered quite in the country, are all laid out in lots, and orchards are continually disappearing. Municipalities are being elaborately laid out, and extensive parks being provided for. That the city will eventually cover most of the Island is proving no dream. Last year the sales in the city amounted to $20,446,416, representing 3,061 sales, while in Westmount business was done to the amount of over $2,000,000. The latest figures show an advance of $5,000,000 as compared with last year. and an increase of $12,000,000 dollars as compared with the year 1902. During the year the registered sales in the

municipalities around the city, exclusive of Westmount, t, totaled $,858,875. The easy terms obtainable are largely responsible for the advance, while tile lack of gnarl accommodation and the rise in rents is continually driving people to seek homes of their own. Details of the year s figures are Town of St. Louis, $1,653,186; Maisonneuve, $831,636 ; Notre Dame de Grace. $456,904; Cotes

<article title=" QUICK METHOD OF VALUING BUILDINGS " author="">QUICK METHOD OF VALUING BUILDINGS.

There are frequently occasions when a knowledge of



some rough system of arriving at the cost of building is desirable, says the Record and Guide." The method on most often employed by all practical real estate men, architects and builders is to multiply the cubical

contents of a structure by a mean price per cubic foot based upon the known average cost of buildings similarly constructed. This system is frequently characterized as imperfect, and at best merely an indefinite suggestion of value. However this may be, the clement of personal judgment without doubt enters into the question, and in arriving at a reasonably correct valuation one must

possess a good knowledge of the cost of construction obtained from experience in such matters. It must be distinctly remembered that there is no fixed rule to follow in this regard, as conditions and the prices of materials vary greatly from time to time. The system may be followed with much success by airy intelligent layman, when the rudiments are well understood, but in the hands of in expert it is infinitely more reliable than many of the hit or miss methods in daily use.
