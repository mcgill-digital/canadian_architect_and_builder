<doctype type="text">	28	THE CANADIAN	ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER



MR. JOSEPH W. POWER.

WE have the pleasure of presenting herewith a portrait and brief sketch of Mr. Joseph W. Power, the newly-elected President of the Ontario Association of Architects. Mr. Power may be said to be an architect by birth, association and education. His father, the late Mr. John Power, studied and practiced architecture in England, and subsequently on coming to Canada in 1847, located in Kingston and conducted a successful practice in that city for a period of 30 years. Mr. Joseph Power, after having completed a college course, and graduated as a C. E., entered his father's office as a student, and served the usual term under articles. In 1873 he was admitted to partnership in the firm, and assisted in the designing and construction of most of the business buildings erected in place of those destroyed by the fire which, in 1876, swept Princess street.

Since the death of his father in 1881, the business has been continued under the same name by Mr. Jos. Power, who has designed and superintended the construction of a number of the principal and most  meritorious buildings of the city, notably the Opera House, St. George's Cathedral, St. Andrew's Church,





















































the Locomotive Works, Collegiate Institute, Central School, Residence of Dr. Horsey, Mr. Pense, Major-General Cameron, the Rectory building, etc.

Mr. Power is a member of the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts, and has been a most active and efficient worker in the Ontario Association of Architects from the date of its organization until the present time. The honor which has been conferred upon him, by electing him to the presidency of the Association, is one which he has fairly earned and is well fitted to wear.

We are in receipt of an attractive calendar issued by Mr. Alex. Bremner, contractors supply merchant, Montreal.



We have received a copy of the 1897 edition of the circular of information of the School of Architecture, Scranton, Pa., containing a description of their method of teaching, details of courses of instruction in architecture, architectural drawing and designing; also sample pages of the instruction and question papers and reduced specimen drawing plates.

TORONTO CHAPTER O.A.A.

THE first regular meeting of the above Chapter was held Monday evening, Feb. 8th, in the School of Practical Science. There were present, Mr. W. R. Gregg, chairman; Henry Simpson, sec. -treas.; Messrs. Wickson Wright, Paull, Gibson, Edwards, Helliwell Burke, Gray, Bishop, Hall, Harper, Gordon, Beckett, Boultbee, Heward and commander Law.

In his opening address Mr. W. R. Gregg threw out some valuable suggestions as to how the meetings of the Chapter might be conducted. He also gave the following list of old city buildings, with dates of their erection, the names of their architects, etc., which showed that Mr. Gregg had gone to very considerable trouble to make the first meeting interesting. So much was this information appreciated by those present that it was thought fitting to have it printed in this issue of

the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.

Mr. A. Frank Wickson's paper on " Sunday School Planning" was listened to with great interest, he having made a copy of the World's Fair Model Sunday School, which, though not applicable to every Sunday school building, showed clearly the main features necessary to proper Sunday school building generally.

The next meeting of the Chapter will be held in the same place on Monday evening, March 8th, at 8 o'clock. A very interesting program is being arranged for by the executive committee. Every architect belonging to the Association should make it a point to be present, as the formation of this Chapter will undoubtedly be of great educational value to those attending its meetings.
