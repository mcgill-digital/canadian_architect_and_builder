<article title="Obituary" author="">OBITUARY.

WITH sincere regret we have this month to record the decease of a very worthy gentleman who for the past 17 years has been a well known figure in the city of Montreal. Mr. <person>J. C. Radford </person>for all this period was Health Officerr in that city, and probably no civic official was better known among architects and builders. He was universally respected and his remains were followed to the grave by the City Council, the Board of Health and many with whom in life, in the exercise of his functions he had continually to do. He was a Trustee of the First Baptist Church and the President of the Temperance Society. ___________________________



<article title="Correspondence - Montreal" author="">MONTREAL

(Correspodence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER)

I REGRET to have to state that Mr. <person>P. W. St. George</person>, City Surveyor, has been confined to his residence for some weeks by a severe illness. Happily however, he is now on the road to convalescence, and on the advice of his physician will spend a short time in the South. It is hoped that he will shortly return home fully restored to health.

<person>Mr. McConnell</person>, Superintendent of the City Water Works Department, has resigned his position owing to inability to work harmoniously with the water committee Mr. McConnell was a valuable official, and his retirement is therefore to be regretted. -

Plans have been prepared and submitted to the President of the <firm>Grand 'Trunk Railway Company</firm>, for the extension of Victoria Bridge, with the object of providing a grand promenade for vehicle and pedestrian traffic across the river.

An old and highly esteemed civic employed has passed away in the person of the late <person>Mr. Glackmeyer</person>, City Clerk. For nearly a half century the de ceased gentleman satisfactorily served the city, and his removal is the subject of the deepest regret to past and present members of the Council as well as a 'wide circle of acquaintances among all classes of the community.

<article title="Frost: its effects on building" author="">FROST: ITS EFFECTS ON BUILDING.

Out-of-door building operations have been much interfered  with by the recent frosts. In many new houses which are being erected by the speculative builder the mortar-joints and pointing have become loose or disintegrated or entirely fallen out through the moisture in the materials. The unfortunate buyer who is persuaded to invest in house property may find a heavy outlay required in making good the brickwork, in repointing, in restoring stonework that has fractured and become loose by the wedge-like action of expansion incident to frost. We cannot understand any builder, except under pecuniary obligations, proceeding with brickwork during a severe frost. He generally takes not the slightest precaution to cover the walls with weather-boards or straw or to use quick-setting mortar made of unslacked lime, a practice which prevails at Christiania, and is said to be successful. This indifference aggravates the offence. Even in Christiania, where building in frosty weather has received particular attention, it is considered that bricklayers' work does not answer in more than 14 to 9½° below freezing point. The bricks too, lie exposed to all weathers s on building estates ; there is no attempt made to protect them from the rain or frost the consequence is, they are used filled with moisture or congealed water. So with blocks of stone; we have seen them sawn and left exposed to the rain or snow, and immediately afterwards cut up and built up on the brickwork. No one looks after these' irregularities, and they go on unchecked until the results are shown in rotten brickwork and stone that flies all to pieces.

In glazing roofs, the same indifference to weather is met with. As glass expands and contracts by heat and cold, the putty joints give way and crack. It is very seldom that we find ordinary care shown as in leaving room in the rebates for expansion and contraction of large sheets of glass, or, better still, to fixing the glass in glooves, especially for shop-front windows. Many systems of patent glazing, such as that of <person>Helliwell</person>, by affording protection to the joints by lead caps, and allowing grooves underneath for condensed moisture, prevent the mischief. The effects of severe frost tell more seriously on the work of the plumber. Not only do the pipes give way by the expansion of the water in them, but the lead flats and gutters contract to such an extent as to cause them to split or tear in the weak parts, or at their connections with the flashings. Yet it is extraordinary that the same unscientific method of laying and fixing should prevail, and that architects still permit these modes of execution to be carried out, or lead to be used unable to bear the strain put upon it. When we can insist on a certain thickness of lead for flats and gutters, and specify certain methods of laying to allow for contraction, when we can incase our water pipes and cover them in non-conducting substances, and provide taps for emptying them during a severe frost, when we can fix our pipes without holding them tight at the joints, there ought to be no possible excuse for allowing them to become exposed to the destructive agencies of frost and heat. The public hailed the advent of the "registered" plumber to do much to prevent these shortcomings, to instruct in scientific plumbing, and to create an improved system of sanitation; but all will be of no purpose unless the appreciative British employer puts within his reach the means for securing the benefits of technical skill, which he can only to do by putting his hand in his pocket and paying honestly those who can best do the work.
