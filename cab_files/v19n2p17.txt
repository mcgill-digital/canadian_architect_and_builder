CANADIAN BANK OF COMMERCE, BRANCH ON YONGE

STREET, TORONTO.—MESSRS. <firm>DARLING & PEARSON</firm>,

ARCHITECTS , TORONTO.



The annual report of the Bank of Commerce stated that the handsome branches which the hank is building, not only in the cities but in the country Towns, are a good investment. This is satisfactory, for the numerous branches, which not only this hank but others are building, are a great addition to the beauty of our cities and towns. Part of the satisfaction they give to the taste is without doubt due to their singleness of purpose. There is usually no visible conglomeration of ends—a bank above and offices below. And the evident testimony to the solid financial position of the corporation which this appropriation of a valuable site for a single purpose gives, adds considerably to the appearance of dignity and character which the same causes—-simplicity and definiteness of purpose—give to the design.

The programme was original and attractive, being in the form of a four-page note-book, the cover being of blue print paper bearing a design of a wall under construction, surmounted by a maple leaf and heaven. The menu was fashioned after the manner of a building, the first course being at the bottom of the page, with the advice, ''begin at the foundation sure."

After the banquet an excellent series of songs and speeches was given. The National Anthem having been sung in response to the toast of ''The King", Rev. <person>A. L.

Simpson,</person> of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, and G. C. Young, President of the <assoc>London Builders' Exchange</assoc>, responded. The latter urged the Toronto Builders' Exchange to take the initiative towards the formation of a Provincial Association. Then followed the toast of ''The Ladies" and ''The Press", proposed respectively by Messrs. <person>Frank Saunders </person>and <person>T. Christie</person>.
