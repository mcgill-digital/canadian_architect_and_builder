Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



SIR,—Competitors from the United States for plans of our proposed City Hall

have written me as to whether such goods will be considered dutiable. You are no doubt in possession of the required information as competitive designs from the States I believe have been sent in for proposed buildings in Toronto. As this question interests the profession at large, I shall look for a few lines from you on the subject in the forthcoming number of your journal.

Your obedient servant,

<person>CHAS. BAILLAIRGE</person>,



City Engineer.

PATENT FLAT WIRE LATHING 

64 Canada Street, Hamilton, Ont.

	















ARCHITECTS AND CONTRACTORS.

GENTLEMEN

notice my	of bringing to your

	notice my Flat Wire Lathing,, for which patents have

been issued in the United States and Canada. The object of the patent is to provide a light, yet substantial Fire-proof Lathing. which offers a smooth, unbroken surface for the reception of plaster, and on which the plaster will key securely. Being made of flat wire, it offers the best plastering surface of any wire lathing. The key is an absolute certainty and is obtained by the  plaster turning over the edge of the wire; this will be found invaluable in the plastering of ceilings. Its many advantages over Round Wire Lathing are apparent. An adjustable foot made of sheet metal, having two hooks, is attached to the lathing and takes the place of furring. By means of these feet the lathing can be fixed in position at one-half the cost of lathing requiring furring. After the cloth is woven the feet may be attached any position required. The cloth may be used in either plain or with the adjustable foot as shown in cut.
