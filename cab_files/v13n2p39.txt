lift the two end vehicles off the road, and on the other hand, at a re-entrant angle or angle less than 180Â° the two end vehicles would be supporting the load, and the girder would be actually lifting the two inside vehicles oft the road, and of course in this case the weight of the vehicles lifted off the rails would be added to the weight of the griders or the load carrying trucks, which would be overloaded and disaster ensue

Further, there is the consideration of the three or four  truck vehicle when travelling over a curve with superelevated rail. 'Take a case of a rigid girder, when travelling on a four-truck vehicle, when passing over such a curve. It is assumed that the girder is supported and fastened at the two centre bolsters only, but that it is simply testing on the two end bolsters.

Fig. 5 will show the position the full lines showing the inner vehicles, and the dotted lines the end vehicle. The centre lines are shown of both sets of vehicles, arid as the center line of the girder is rigidly straight, it will be seen at once that the end vehicles will lift the ends of the girder, together with the inner vehicles, every time a curve with canted rails is passed over.

Further, there is yet the consideration that the connection of the bolster to the waggon is only at its centre or point of swivel, and at no other place. If the wind is taken into account together with a large cant in the rails, a considerable overturning tendency has to be dealt with. For this the sole connection at the swivel is not quite satisfactory, and some holding down link at the ends of the bolster should be made, at least in the case of very deep girders. The case of the usual load of rails on these trolleys need not be considered, as the rails are neither so rigid nor stacked so high as the girder on edge.

Fig. 6 gives an idea of such an attachment ; of course the links or attachment should be made so that the bolster has full liberty to move sideways upon its bearings. Great care should be taken to oil or grease all parts that require it before the journey is made.--Building News.
