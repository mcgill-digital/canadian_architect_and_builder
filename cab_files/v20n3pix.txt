NOTES.

A new firm of architects has been established at Port Arthur, Ont., where Mr. Geo. Edge and Mr. A. Anderson have formed a partnership. Both these gentlemen are experienced men and, from present indications, a good business will be transacted.

It will be highly satisfactory to members of the Royal Institute of British Architects generally to learn, says Building News, that there will be a substantial margin to the good after all expenses of the late International Congress of Architeets have been settled, and thus a considerable credit in

favor of the Institute has been insured, largely owing to the popularity and great success of the Congress meetings, as well, of coarse, to the care and painstaking estimates calculated by the executive at the outset of the proceedings. Very likely it will he proposed that the extra services of the staff ought to be recognized in an appropriate way by a money payment proportionate to the work accomplished, and we think there can be little doubt such a proposition will be heartily supported by the members. Certainly the success of the Congress was not achieved without a vast amount of clerical labor efficiently accomplished.
