PERSONAL.



James Hobbs, a well—known builder of Hamilton, Ont. is dead. Mr. Kivas Tulley, chief architect of the Public Works Department of Ontario, has been succeeded by Mr. F. R. Heakes formerly assistant architect. Mr. Tulley has been retained as consulting architect and engineer.



Mr. J. B. Resther, senior member of the architectural firm of Resther & Sons, Montreal, and a leading member of the Province of Quebec Association of Architects, died on the 14th inst., after a brief illness He was sixty-six years of age, and had been a resident of Montreal for many years.



The death occurred in Toronto, on the first of May, of Mr. Wilham Hynes, at the age of 69 years. In his earlier days Mr. Hynes was a prominent contracting plasterer, being a member of the firm of Hynes Bros., who carried on business from 1840 10 1875. During that time contracts were executed in many of the best buildings of the city, among which were Osgoode Hall, Toronto Insane Asylum, Customs House and R. Walker & Son's store.

ELECTRICITY IN STONE QUARRIES.

IN Europe electricity is being Largely used in the operation of stone quarries, and is claimed to have many advantages over steam power. A French writer has recently made comparisons showing the efficiency and economy of the two systems. Concerning the steam plant he says Suppose we have a boiler evaporating 8.5 kilograms per kilogram of coal. A good machine of 300 horse power requires not more than 6.5 kilograms of steam per horse power indicated. This will give an additional horse power for every 763 grains. The transformation of mechanical into electrical energy means 6 per cent. loss ; add to this 7 per cent. lost in conductors, and absorption in receiver of 7 per cent., and there is a total loss of 23 per cent. Suppose we have a stone saw motor of 20 horse power, the central machine will develop 30 effective horse power, or about 33 indicated horse power. The consumption of coal then will show a total of 610 kilograms per 24 hours.

In the old method condensation was responsible for much loss of valuable power, and the great item was the enormous consumption of coal in comparison with the amount of work done.



On the other hand, with electrical apparatus the principal generator 0111) absorbs an amount of energy proportioned to the work. Other advantages are fewer employees, and consequently a smaller percentage of accidents, the prevention of many breakages, while the speed of the machinery is more readily controlled.

The electrical system of operating their quarries was adopted about two years ago by the Hainaut Quarries Company, at Soignies, Belgium. The quarries of this company cover an area of 96 acres. For the handling of immense blocks a travelling crane of 6o tons capacity is actuated by an electric motor. A second motor is at the bottom of the quarry for drawing the blocks away from their bed A travelling crane of 10 tons capacity is moved by a third motor. All the machines are shunt wound and have reversing rheostats. The system is said to have given entire satisfaction.

SOLAR ROOM, STOKESAY CASTLE.

<article title=" SOLAR ROOM, STOKESAY CASTLE " author="">

NOTE The design for a summer hotel, by Mr. G. A. Monette, architect, published in the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for April, is to be built shortly at Grosbois Island, opposite Boucherville, Que. The building has a frontage of 120 X 100 feet, and will contain about 120 bed-rooms, with all modern conveniences. It has been so planned that a part of the hotel may be used in winter and the other part closed. The exterior will be clap—boarded and shingled, with panels in rough—cast work.



The James Smart Manufacturing Co., of Brockville, Ont., in their advertisement in this number, print some particulars of the Kelsey Warm Air Generator, of which they are the exclusive manufacturers for Canada.
