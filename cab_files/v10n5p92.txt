	<article title=" THE DUTY ON BUILDING	MATERIALS " author="">THE DUTY ON BUILDING	MATERIALS.

BY the new Canadian tariff, which took effect on April 23rd, several changes are made in the import duties on building and construction materials, but taken as a whole they are of a moderate character, and are not likely to seriously affect many industries. A feature of the new tariff is the double schedule, framed with the object of giving Great Britain a preference in our markets, and of compelling other countries to adopt reciprocal tariffs. This double schedule provides for reducing the import duty whenever any country gives certain concessions to the products of Canada.

The arrangement of the duties on cement is rather in favor of Canadian manufacturers, but not to the extent that is generally believed. Under the former tariff the duty was 40 cents per barrel of 375 pounds. The standard barrel of Belgium cement is 350 pounds, therefore the duty under the present tariff of 12 1/2 cents per 100 pounds would he 4334 cents per barrel, or an increase of 334 cents. The standard English barrel is 375 pounds, which would make the present duty 4734 cents less a discount of one-eighth under the preferential clause, leaving the duty to be paid on English cement this year at about 41 1/2 cents. But after the first of January, 1898, a further reduction of one-eighth is to be given to Great Britain, in which case English cement may be imported under a duty of slightly over 36 cents per barrel, or four cents less than the former duty. It would appear from the above that the increased duty required to be paid on importations from other foreign countries may result in the use of greater quantities of cement of English and Canadian manufacture.

The present tariff does not entirely meet the views of Canadian bridge manufacturers. The duty on imported bridges is slightly reduced, while an increase of 2 1/2 per cent. is made on bridge plate, which constitutes the chief imported raw material of the manufacturers. This increase, however, is not sufficient to seriously affect the Canadian firms.

Manufacturers of heating apparatus view the new regulations favorably. The manufactured goods are now protected from foreign competition by a duty of 30 per cent., an increase of 2 1/2 per cent., while pig iron, scrap iron, iron pipe, and such materials, which constitute the bulk of the raw material used in the construction of furnaces and radiators, are admitted more liberally than heretofore. Pig iron, formerly subject to a duty of $4 per ton, is now imported for $2.50, and wrought iron pipe at 35 per cent., whereas the old tariff on iron pipe was 30 per cent. and cent per lb., which was equal to an additional 30 per cent., making the rate fully 6o per cent. As an offset to the above reduction, the government have increased the bounty to be paid to Canadian manufacturers of iron and steel. Notwithstanding the above reduction in cost of raw material, it is in
