INTERESTING EXPERIMENTS WITH TYPHOID GERMS.

 THE village of Iron Mountain, Michigan, was last summer ravaged by typhoid fever, epidemic in its

nature. It was suspected that impure' drinking water was the cause of the trouble, and to settle this point a sample of the water was sent to Dr. Vaughn, of the School of Hygiene, at the State University, for an analysis. The epidemic was so severe that 330 cases were reported, first and last, and 35 deaths. One part of the town has a public water supply and escaped the scourge; but the other part, whose inhabitants are supplied with water from shallow wells of from 6 to 20 feet in depth, was sorely visited by the disease. The examinations of Dr. Vaughn led to the conclusive discovery of germs in the water capable of producing typhoid fever. The doctor inoculated sterilized meat preparations and sterilized milk with the well water, and kept the preparation at the temperature of the body for seven days. During this time the germ developed in both the meat and the milk.

He then 'resorted to a further experiment, which is said to be the first of its kind; and which may prove to be of the greatest possible interest and value. Taking  some of these typhoid germs, the' doctor inoculated several cats with them, and in each case a disease similar to typhoid fever was developed, thus apparently establishing the certainty of the source of the epidemic and also the possibility of using the lower animals to trace such a disease back to its cause. In a report covering these interesting facts, just made to the State Board of Health, Dr. Vaughn says that there are annually, in Michigan 1,000 deaths and 10,000 cases of sickness from typhoid fever, adding his conviction that nearly all this may be prevented if the people will only stop polluting the soil and the water. He adds some other important practical conclusions. A succession of freezing and thawing may ultimately result' in the destruction of the typhoid germs in the water, but it matters not how cold the winter may be if there is not a continued succession of freezing and thawing the typhoid germ will not be affected. The same is true with regard to ice formed on impure water. - The poisonous germs will be preserved intact to do their deadly work the moment the ice is brought into use. As in so many cases typhoid fever arises from the use of impure water -and impurely- diluted milk, the doctor recommends, where any doubt exists as to the purity of the water, that it should always be boiled.



The Port Arthur Water and Light Company has recently been incorporated.

 he city authorities of Winnipeg     propose to extend

the city sewers and provide for the proper flushing of them. 

The Board of Health of Quebec province report that during the year 1887 not a single case of small-pox appeared in the province. 

Stratford is discussing the electric light. 'A. proposition has been made to buy a Royal plant at a cost of $10,000, to run fifty lamps.

Cholera has broken out in some of the South American ports. Our quarantine officials will doubtless keep a careful look-out in that direction.

A committee appointed by the Ontario Provincial Board of Health has reported that 'the- recent fever epidemic at Ottawa was caused by the use of river water of inferior quality.

The Goderich local papers are calling on the town authorities to take measures for preventing the spread of infectious diseases, in view of the prevalence of diphtheria

 in the town lately. It will be remembered that last year Sir Donald

 Smith and Sir George Stephen gave half a million-dollars apiece towards the erection of a public hospital in Montreal. The city thereupon gave a site for the building at the foot of the mountain, above the reservoir. The Local Board of Health has decided to' ask the Council to get the opinion of a scientific commission as

to whether the city water supply would-be likely to be affected by the nearness of the hospital..



 The Drain Inspector of Montreal says that house keepers should not think so hardly of draughty, cool houses in winter. He believes that many people are saved from sickness in badly drained houses owing to unpremeditated ventilation. "Often and often," said Mr. Lowe, "the house we would consider the warmest, best and nicest fixed is the one where sickness stays longest owing to the imperfect drainage. There is nothing like ventilation. Housekeepers, too, do not pay sufficient attention to the sinks. ' Closed sinks get especially dirty, and prove little hotbeds of disease."

A system of steam heating for railway cars is said to be in successful operation on the Canada Atlantic Railway. It is known as the Sewall system, and consists of a main pipe with radiators in the cars. Heating is supplied by the engine; and provision is also made for supplying heat, independent of the engine, in case of a car being side tracked or waiting at junctions for incoming trains, or in event of accident interrupting the connection with the main supply of steam. In such cases heating steam is supplied from a small boiler in 'each car, that receives the drip of condensed water from the pipes, having a small fire box under it.

The proceedings of the second annual meeting of the Association of Executive Health Officers of Ontario, just closed in this city, were of a most interesting and profitable character. The programme included reports of committees on "House and Land Drainage and Disposal of Sewage "; "Ventilation of Houses, Schools and  Public Halls";" Food, its Adulteration- and Unwholesome Supply"; Milk Supply, its-Sources and Contamination"; "Water Supplies' and their Contamination " "Removal of Night Soil and Garbage"; "Control and Prevention of Disease "; "Dangerous and Unhealthy Occupations "; "Sanitary Legislation." Instructive and valuable papers were read on "Methods of Dealing with City Sewage," by P. Drayton, Chairman Local Board of  Health, Toronto; "Recent Methods in Milk Analysis," by N. B. Nesbitt, B.A. M.D., Toronto -The Duty of the State in Investigating the Causes of Disease," by Prof. Victor C.

WHAT	CONSTITUTES JUDICIOUS ADVERTISING?



As to the advantages of judicious advertising, most  business men are agreed; judging from the vast amount of money wasted annually by advertisers, the methods of judicious advertising are but very. imperfectly understood. The following extract from an article' in the Toronto Saturday Night, on "Advertising as a Fine Art," is in accord with common sense, as well as the experience ,of successful advertisers. Our contemporary says : 

"Promiscuous advertising is most injudicious. A man who wants to express goods to a certain town will not-ship, them over half-a-dozen roundabout roads. He will send them by the most direct route, get them to his patrons quicker and save himself annoyance and expense. It is practically the same in advertising, 'although the oily-tongued advertising agents who flood.

the country and earn a precarious living by assurance -and gab, would endeavor to convince the advertiser that all roads lead to Rome. It is a mistake to suppose that advertising in a paper with a large circulation is necessarily, judicious advertising. No greater error could be made. I spoke a while back of the wholesale grocer and his advertisement in the widely-circulated daily as compared with the same advertisement in a

trade paper. The same		-

trade paper may not have the circulation of the daily, but IT GETS TO THE PEOPLE THE ADVERTISER WANTS TO REACH, which is all he wants, while he. saves the percentage of money he would have to spend to put his advertisement before those readers of the daily not affected by it, and who are consequently of no use to

him. If he desires to reach a thousand people in a  certain walk in life, it is cheaper for him to utilize the

columns of a paper thatâ€”goes to thoseâ€” thousand people and no others, than it is to pay five or six times more

 for the use of a paper which only reaches about half the people he is anxious to appeal to although its

outside circulation may amount to forty thousand.
