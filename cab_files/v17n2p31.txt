<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	3'

With regard to our residential work, I consider, too, Canadians stand in the front rank. Our architects have so studied both the convenient and artistic in ordinary house planning that even our mother country may pause to consider.

But there is one point we should guard against, that is the tendency of nearly all our work to he Americanized. Personally it is the only thing I deplore in our Canadian art; whether it is really having too much to do, or whether it is indifference (it certainly is not lack of ability), but the bulk of our work borders on plagiarism.

I appreciate the fact that our needs commercially and socially are much on par with our neighbors, but there are factors in our national and private life and our institutions that demand our impress. Why we should design and plan certain classes of buildings on the same lines as a foreign nation I cannot see.

I do not so much object to Carnegie money for our free libraries. hut I do most strongly object to that money being clothed in American art on Canadian soil. The younger men in our profession arc doing good work; some markedly so; and it is to such we particularly address this word of warning.

Every endeavor should bc made in art schools and architectural classes to foster unconscious individuality that will master for itself our everyday problems, and clothe our needs in our own designing, in our own materials, and with our own tools, that all we do may hear our very own impress.

I feel that the past year has developed an excellent spirit among the members of our profession no doubt greatly due to the social intercourse we enjoy through the local chapter. That this will lead us to uniting ourselves in the greater interests of our profession us devoutly to he hoped for.

Well we know we have a great country and a great people, and we, whose prerogative it is to hand down to posterity our nation's thoughts and aims "in imperishable stone'' can more faithfully do so by unitedly aiming for greater results in our educational work and our social  intercourse.

Gentlemen. I thank you for the honor you have conferred upon me in electing me your president for the past year. The members of the Council have been most unselfish in their attendance to the duties devolving upon them, and have given unstintedly of time and thought to the Association's welfare.

Mr. Denison: There are two items here of money paid to an agent for obtaining advertisements to be published in our report of the Proceedings for the year, and while they decrease the balance of the amount, we have been paid for two years during this year; I think about $800 will come to its for the advertisements that will appear this year, so that the report will he much better than it appears now. We paid out for last year $191.41, and for this year 5206.75, both happening this year.

Mr. Denison moved seconded by Mr. Wickson, that the report of the Treasurer he adopted. Mr. Denison stated that the report had been audited and signed by the auditors.

Mr. Sidall: I have just one remark to make. I notice the amount of money spent this year for coeducation amounts to only $38; I think the hare mention of that amount is enough to emphasize the point which I want to make. I think it is a very small sum to spend on the important work of architectural education.

Mr. Denison: I would. like to say to my friend in reply that possibly he has not thought of the large amount of money we are expending on meetings, such as we are holding to-day and have held in the past, all of which is part of our educational system. We are having papers from eminent men, and these go into the hands of our architectural students. It is not such a small total as it would appear on the lace of it. We have expended a great deal of money in publishing our Proceedings; the printing of them last year cost $229.50 50, a large proportion of which is for these valuable papers, which we look upon as a most efficient means of educating our students.

The President: I dare say we will hear something from t he educational committee on this subject. If there is no further discussion I will declare the report adopted.

The President: I see Mr. Kivas Tully, our veteran representative, in the room, and I take much pleasure in inviting him to a seat on the platform.

Mr. Tully took a seat on the platform. (Applause.)

The Registrar's report was presented and read by Mr. W. R. Gregg.
