THE <assoc>Association of Building Commissioners and Inspectors of the United States </assoc>has resolved that buildings for the care of children and invalids should not be more than two stories in height, unless constructed of fire-proof material.



WE have to record another accident, with fatal results, due to the collapse of a derrick. This occurred on the 24th of March in connection with the new <building>Wellington bridge </building>in course of construction by the Dominion Government on the Lachine Canal, Montreal. Two workmen, <person>Michael Owens </person>and <person>Timothy Gallivar</person>, were killed by the falling of the derrick mast. As the result of an inquest to enquire into the circumstances, the jury suggested that the Government should employ more competent men on works of this kind.





IT is pleasing to note from a recent return made by Mr. <person>E. Coatsworth</person>, City Commissioner for Toronto, that there is a marked increase in the value of the buildings, especially dwellings, now being erected. In 1891 it appears from the report that the average cost of 1,100 houses built, was $2,700 each. While in 1892 the number of dwellings erected dropped to 529, the average cost was $3,000. It is a good indication of the thrift and frugality of the people of Toronto when out of the 30,000 dwelling houses now in the city, 50 per cent. of them are owned by the occupiers.



The <assoc>Victorian Institute of Architects </assoc>announces three competitions. One, open to all resident architects in the Australian colonies under the age of 30 years, is for the best design for a school of art and picture galleries. The other two are for probationers and students of the members of the Institute. Additional interest in architectural matters and a more rapid development of architectural taste and skill would he likely to follow a movement of this character on the part of the Councils of the provincial Architectural Associations in Canada. The expense of one or two competitions each year would probably not be deemed sufficient, apart from other considerations, to prevent the attempt being made.



IN December last the <firm>Toronto Incandescent Electric Light Co</firm>. reduced their price to customers from one cent per hour to eight-tenths of a cent per hour for 6 c. p. lamps. This step, the company state, resulted in almost doubling the volume of their business. Thus encouraged they have announced within the last few days then decision to further reduce the price to six-tenths of a cent per lamp per hour. At this price incandescent electric lighting should displace gas in business establishments at least. It is said to be the intention of the gas company to meet this cut in rates for electric lighting by a corresponding reduction in the price of gas.



IN the matter of the dispute which has arisen in connection with the erection of the new city and county buildings at Toronto, application was made on the 4th inst. by Mr. <person>Neelon</person> (the late contractor) for an injunction to prevent these works being completed other than according to the order granted by the court September 10th last, which, it was contended on behalf of the applicant, allowed the work to be done only by day labor. An arrangement was come to by which the order referred to was enlarged so as to allow the work to proceed by contract and extending the rights of the applicant as relating to his action for damages, if the work was so carried out.
