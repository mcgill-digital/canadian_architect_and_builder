<article title=" THE BILLBOARD MALADY." author="">THE BILLBOARD MALADY.

In pointing out that billboard advertising has been largely relegated to liquors and nostrums, the Massachusetts conference for village betterment has touched the weakest spot of the feeble form of publicity. Always offensive to good taste, thc billboard is daily growing more so by the loss of patronage of advertisers who are careful of the company they keep. When this process of elimination goes far enough, the billboard will become a medium for only the advertisers that cannot get a hearing through respectable channels. Then probably laws will be passed that will rid the public of this nuisance for good and all. The Western Architect.
