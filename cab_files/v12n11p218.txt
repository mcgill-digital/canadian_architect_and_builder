WILLIAM A. GUNN.

THE announcement of the death at his home in London, Ont., on October 21st, of Mr. William A. Gunn, secretary of the McClary Manufacturing Company, caused widespread regret. The cause of death was Bright's disease, from which the deceased had for some time been a sufferer. His last illness dated from August, when he was obliged to cease business activities. By his death the company with which he was connected suffers a serious loss, and the city of London, in which he was born, and which was the scene of his active and useful career, is deprived of one of its most highly esteemed and valued citizens.

The late Mr. Gunn was a son-in-law of Mr. John McClary, and for twelve years previous to his death had

been secretary of the McClary Manufacturing Co., in which capacity he displayed business ability of a high order coupled with unflagging industry. He was also a director of the Ontario Loan and Debenture Co.

A wife, four sons and two daughters comprise the bereaved family.

The funeral was attended by three hundred and fifty employees of the company and a large number of the leading citizens.

MINERAL PRODUCTION OF QUEBEC.

FROM the annual report of the Inspector of Mines it is learned that the total value of the mineral production of Quebec last year was $1,673,337, of which bricks alone represent a value of $6oo,ooo and lime of $140,000. About $500,000 worth of asbestos was mined and $200,000 worth of copper. This leaves about $200,000 worth of iron ore, gold, mica, chrome ore and slate. Phosphate mining, once so important an industry, has declined until at the present time it amounts to very little.

A Canadian correspondent of the Clayworker has this to say regarding our native terra cotta: " Ontario sampled architectural terra cotta some twenty years ago, and used it as something that was sure to melt in the first shower or go to pieces after the first Ontario winter, but it remains, to the astonishment of some and the disgust of the stone cutter and quarry man. Its being talked against, kicked at, belittled and ignored has proven like the Irish peddler's tinâ€”' the more you rub it and scour it the thicker it grows.' Time removes prejudice, but time uses up life too, and the pioneer grows old before the harvest comes."
