part of the day or evenings for special subjects, instruction in which could not be obtained in their offices.

From the brief description of what is being done for architectural training in Britain, France and the United States, it will, I think, be evident that it is a subject which at the present time is considered of great importance, and is receiving a large share of attention, From the experience gained during the last twenty years, the consensus of opinion appears to be that study in the scientific and art subjects before referred to are essential to fully equip an architect for fulfilling the duties of his profession.

While the subject of architectural training has of late years and in other lands received great attention, and facilities more or less complete have been provided for imparting instruction in the special subjects required by an architect, no attempt has yet been made in the Dominion for the foundation of a Chair of Architecture in connection with any of our universities or colleges, nor are there any schools of art or technology in which pupils who have already entered upon the study of architecture in offices can obtain any practical assistance in the prosecution of their studies. Some time ago there was a rumor that the Minister of Education for the Province of Ontario intended founding a Chair of Architecture in the University of Toronto, but the scheme has not yet materialized.

It is to be hoped, however, that the <assoc>Associations of Architects now formed in Ontario and Quebec </assoc>will in the interests of the architects agitate for some means of affording the special instruction required by present and future pupils in preparing them to pass the examinations required by the respective Associations. either by the foundation of Chairs of Architecture in connection with our existing universities or colleges, or by the establishment of lectures and classes in immediate connection with the Associations. It would be premature at this early stage in the history of the Associations to suggest any particular scheme of education, but I feel that the necessity for affording some means of instruction in special subjects to present and future student associates, to enable them to pass the final examinations for registration, will soon force itself upon the attention of the associations.

For the present it would be a step towards and preparation for a more complete scheme if the Faculties of Applied Science of one or more of our universities would add a Chair of Architecture, and by means of lectures or classes in special subjects, afford instruction in such subjects as cannot very well be obtained in the daily routine of an architect's office.

At the present time the faculties of law in connection, I believe, with <person>McGill</person> and <person>Laval </person>Universities, while providing for a full course of instruction qualifying their graduates to pass the

examinations for admission to the bar, also provide for lectures at such hours as will admit of students in law offices attending them, and that attendance on these lectures are compulsory on the students. If some such arrangement as this could be carried out, it would meet the present requirements.

NOTE.â€”Since preparing this paper I am glad to learn that a Chair of Architecture has been founded in the University of Toronto, and that Mr.

<person>C.	H. Wright </person>has been appointed as Professor, and hope that other universities may soon follow the example set them by Toronto.

<article title="Correspondence - Halifax" author="">HALIFAX, N. S.

(Correspondence of	the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.) TRADE DIFFICULTIES.

IN this city each trade has its own association, and nearly all city men are members of their respective associations. Then here Amalgamated Trades and Labor Union. When any member of an citation has a grievance to complain of against his employer, or who

employer violates the rules of an association, the case is investigated by association to which the aggrieved belongs, or whose rules have been viola and if the investigating committee find that the employer has dealt one with an employee, or contra to the rules of the association, or violated rules of the association in any way, and refuses to comply or rectify wrong the matter is laid before the amalgamated union, and all members

under obligation to quit work on that employer's job until he has made amends, &c. One of the rules of the <assoc>Painters Association </assoc>was that no master painter should have more than three apprentices in his employ. The firm of <firm>Thomas Reardon & Co. </firm>took on a fourth apprentice, insisted on retaining him, and set him to work on the <building>City Club building</building>. now in course of erection, which resulted in a strike of all workmen on that job. <person>Reardon</person>'s entire staff of painters being union men, quit work on his other jobs. Other master painters endeavored to assist Reardon, which caused their union men to strike also. This strike on the City Club building

occurred during the last week of August. About a fortnight after. master painter <person>David Roche</person>, who was one of the parties that tried to assist Reardon, and who had the sub-contract for painting the new <building>Catholic Glebe House</building>, now in course of erection, sent an apprentice to prime work on that job, when all hands there struck work. Then followed strikes on several other jobs from similar causes.

Manufacturers and master workmen of the various trades then formed an Association, when committees from this and the <assoc>Amalgamated Trades and Labor Union </assoc>met a number of limes to try and arrange a settlement. Two difficulties stood in the way of a settlement. First, Reardon positively refused to adhere to the painters' rules regarding the number of apprentices to be employed, and the other master painters sided with him in this respect; secondly, a day or two after the strike on the City Club building, two union painters went back to work with Rear. don, thereby making themselves liable to a fine of $5 per day according to the rules of the Painters' Association, and which the painters demanded before agreeing to a settlement with the master workmen's Association. The latter, however, considered it unfair to these men who stuck to their work during the strike to leave them unprotected by their Association Finally, after many meetings, it was agreed to leave the case of these men to be dealt with by the Painters Association. As to the apprentice question, an agreement was reached by <assoc>the Manufacturers' and

Master Mechanics Association</assoc> and the <assoc>Trades and Labor Council</assoc>, which provides: That all strikers shall at once resume work, the matter of the suspended members of the Painters' Union to be left with the Union to be dealt with the pay of painters apprentices to be $2.50 per week the first year, with an increase of $1.50 per week each year, including vacation, but excluding bonuses every apprentice must be able to read and write the English language, and be not less than 16, nor above 21 years of age; every apprentice must agree to abide by the rules jointly agreed upon by the Associations master painters must keep apprentices under legitimate instruction and otherwise comply with the conditions of agreement; a record to be kept of all apprentices employed, and the term of their apprenticeship; the joint committee of the two Associations to supervise the employment of apprentices, adjust all appeals preferred either by employers or apprentices, and for cause terminate apprenticeships, or place an apprentice with a new employer; apprentices to be entitled to and to be paid for one week's vacation a certificate to be furnished the joint committee by the employer when an apprentice has completed his term, and the seal of both Associations shall be attached to such certificate, which shall then be accepted as evidence of the holders right to rank as a journeyman. The agreement further provides that no strike is to be inaugurated until the points in dispute have been submitted to the <assoc>Manufacturers and Master Mechanics' Association </assoc>and the Trades and Labor Council, and if necessary, referred by them to arbitration. If the latter course is adopted, the decision of the arbitrators is to be final. Should a member of either Association infringe in any way the conditions of this agreement, the Association to which he belongs shall forfeit the sum of $100. Unfortunately, strong opposition has developed in the <assoc>Trades and Labor Council </assoc>to the ratification of this agreement assented to by its representatives, while the union painters refuse to go to work until the question regarding the non-union men is settled, consequently a final adjustment of the entire difficulty, which was supposed to have been well-nigh reached, seems to be almost as far distant as ever.
