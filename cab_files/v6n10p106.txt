<doctype type="text">	106	THE CANADIAN	ARCHITECT	AND BUILDER.	October, 1893



wealthy French Canadians came to the rescue, as has now been done by the munificent benefactors of McGill. I say it was less needed than a School of Architecture, for at this stage of our country's progress, our engineers do not require to go abroad for help or hints. In this respect we are now self sufficient, as even when the Victoria was run over the St. Lawrence, our Keefers were adequate to the task and there was no need of going to England for men unacquainted with our climate and who merely proved their common sense and prudence by adhering strictly to the Canadian engineers' design.

America has outstripped Europe in very many things:	the 800 feet span railway bridge over the Niagara, the mere stupendous one of double the span between New York and Brooklyn. The Frith of Forth, of Scotland, to he sure, in its turn outstrips the Brooklyn with its twin arches of 1700 feet, and leaves the Eiffel tower in the shade, but its very boldness of conception was due to lessons taught on the Columbian continent, lessons from the United States and Canada, by our now nearly half a million miles of railway with their stupendous cantilevers reaching from cliff to cliff over rivers and ravines innumerable and of untold depth, across the Rockies, the  Nevadas and the more than marvellous Colorado, and other heretofore so-called impracticable situations, but which our American engineers have mastered in spite of old world fogies pronouncing them impossible.

Nor need we in this respect allude to aught else that our own system of inland navigation which tint only equals but surpasses anything of the kind in the old world.

Our engineers have not been slow to mould their minds, their works on the same vast scale as that of our waters, while European engineering has been dwarfed in some respects by having to deal with the narrower streams, the less precipitous rocks of the Eastern Hemisphere. We have the proof of this in our Quebec docks, where when looked down upon from the city ramparts, it makes one's heart sore to think of the millions that have been wasted in the construction of a jetty some 4000 feet in length, to enclose what ? not as it should have done, a space commensurate with our increasing Canadian commerce, an extent of ground where a series of piers or wharves could have been built out southward from the jetty and made capable of affording berths for a score or more of ocean steamers, had the jetty been moved northward by 500 or a 1000 feet as it could and should have been no, nothing of the kind, nothing but a mere strip, a few hundred feet, the veriest fraction of our comparatively immense estuary of the St. Charles at its confluence with the St. Lawrence, a basin where a vessel of any length can not even turn around in, but must back out of by the same route it comes in.

Had a Canadian engineer been entrusted with this work, such an anomaly, such a costly blunder, never could have occurred, and what is of concomitant importance, the engineers over the work, both resident and foreign, unacquainted as it is now evident they were with the severities of our climate, anti with the stress against a dock wall exercised by such a semi-fluid material as the sand dredging with which the jetty is made up, and apparently entirely oblivious of the allowance to lie made in a retaining wall for the surcharge brought to bear on it by the mountains of coal heaped upon the embankment, have made the walls so thin, so inadequate to stand the thrust, that they are now and have been ever since the filling in has been completed in the rear thereof, gradually and surely bulging outward to their eventual destruction, and tie rods are now being inserted through them stud one hundred feet into the heart of the embankment where they are anchored to stay the ruin, while the unresisting nature of the made ground is such that the ties should have been taken through the 300 feet width of jetty and anchored to the opposite or north face or cribwork of the mole.

This subject of the strength of retaining walls is of vital importance, and that they are generally made of insufficient thickness to stand the thrust from behind is evidenced by the giving away of the revetment wall along Commercial street, Montreal, which, if of proper thickness, say not less than 1/3 the height, as if to hear the stress of water, and thicker where a surcharge is to be allowed for, should have lasted 100 years or more instead of 50, to say nothing of the walls of antiquity, many of which still stand solid and unyielding after a life of several thousand years.

Imported English engineering knowledge was again at fault, and where the climate could not be invoked or blamed for it, when from failing to test the nature of the ground by boring, as should have been done, the front wall of the Levis graving dock had to be removed 65 feet further toward or to the southward and the dock curtailed by so much in its length, art error requiring the construction of an otherwise unnecessary dam costing $118,000 and in other ways nearly doubling the cost of the improvement, while rendering the dock so much less frequently available to vessels of the length built now-a-days

I have said, gentlemen, that we are now well provided for in the way of a professional engineering education, but we can not say as much for architecture. To be sure, a great step has lately been taken by the profession in this country, in forming an architectural association, and obliging would-be architects to submit to a thorough examination as to their technical requirements and fitness for the business.

Our friend Morther is also entitled to our suffrages for embarking on the courageous and arduous task, may it prove a paying one, of editing and publishing his now well known, well patronized journal of architecture and construction, styled THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER. Members of the profession have entered, I am glad to say, on a course of theoretical and practical instruction for the benefit of students, and papers on pertinent subjects are read at meetings of the association in their rooms in Montreal, and re-echoed through the length and breadth of the Dominion and abroad by he kindly efforts of the gentleman just alluded to, for the benefit of all. But something more is required to be done for students, aspirants to our ranks a chair must be established in one of our universities with a paid professor having in his disposal the necessary models, the indispensable appliances for imparting knowledge of a technical and practical nature; just as for is course of physics, chemistry, electricity mind the like, instruments and specimens arc at hand for imparting a thorough knowledge of the sciences.

If no one can be found amongst ins rich enough and patriotic to do the needful, our Government should be appealed to, to help Laval in this long talked of chair of architecture at the University, and what I am now about to add to these preliminary considerations will amply demonstrate the need of instruction in the theory and art of building. And engineers would like their confrere architects, be amply benefited thereby; for the professions overlap in many instances, and in the same way that an architect must know something of engineering, as when building foundations its water, or when called on to design and carry out a viaduct, is light house, etc., so must the engineer trench upon the domain of the architect in the construction of a mill or manufactory, a bridge, an engine or power house for water works, electro motion, a grain or other elevator, a store for dockage purposes, a railway station, and the like.

During a professional career of now over 40 years as land surveyor, engineer and architect, I have had to design, estimate cost and superintend the c instruction of very many structures of all kinds, small mind large: dwelling houses, churches and presbyteries, the Laval University buildings,

colleges, convents, asylums, hospitals, hotels, schools, theatres, mills, manufactories,

etc.; and engaged as I have been in hundreds of arbitration cases, relating to defects of construction, as in the settlement of untold accounts for extras arising out of faults of omissions and contmission on the part of builders, architects and so-called engineers and others; I have had abundant opportunity to notice the great and unpardonable ignorance displayed inn scores of instances, of the simplest rules of the constructive art.

There is nothing more usual for instance, with tire bulk of our would-lie architects and builders than to be totally ignorant of the fact that the strength of a beam or joist is as the square of its depth, and inversely as its length, though they can hardy help seeing without any calculation that the supporting power increases with the breadth.

Do they even know the meaning of the term "square of depth," or if so would they riot see that whatever unit they add to the breadth of beam, a fraction of the same added to the height tin depth of a joist would produce an equivalent effect. Thus, while to double the strength of a beam its depth remaining the same, its breadth must be double; the same increment of additional resistance is added to it by increasing its depth by four-tenths only, run a little more than one-third of its vertical height, with a saving of nearly two-thirds in the quantity and weight of the additional timber, and the same of course in dealing with irons or steel bearers or supporting bars of tinny kind. To treble the strength, the advantage is more apparent; it suffices to and not the double of four tenths, but only seven-tenths; subtle to quadruple the strength, the depth has only to be doubled, on trebled to make it nine times as resistant to any load it may have to support, sod sixty-six and two-thirds pen cent of tire material saved.

Of course there is a practical limit to thus adding to the height of beam to inter-ease its strength; as, in the ease of timber for instance, the deeper beam must he cut from a larger and more expensive log, and if very deep, staying or lateral bridging must he introduced to prevent shearing, twisting on giving laterally. And again the depth of floors can omit be indefinitely increased, the height between them decreased by so much, or the height of structure added to in a manner to make it more costly or of ungainly aspect. What is more usual in scores of dwelling houses and other buildings, than to see the doors out of square, and table so much inclined than you cannot lay is pencil on it without its rolling off,— everything in the house in a word omit of the perpendicular or out of level, and all this due to a settling of the centre of the structure attribute to sheer ignorance of the fact that the middle wall of a house should be of just double the strength of the outer walls; while in general not half so strong, or worse than that, no wall at all — a mere stud partition where tire superposed heath and foot sills and joists and other horizontally placed timbers crush and shrink both by their own weight and ins the action of drying - Then there is the incident cracking of the plaster due to the settlement; and the unhorizontal litres of the ceilings and skirtings rendered more strikingly so by the skew to which tire vertically hung papering has to be cut at top and bottom to fit the inequalities, and which to a sensitive and appreciative eye cannot hut be a source of mental agony, to say nothing of the bodily inconvenience of such a structure and of the expense of cutting doors to suit, displacing locks, hatches, etc.

These defects, this saving of the cost of a central wall or other- adequate modes of support by east or wrought iron columns and bearers resting directly the one out the other, or an incompressible stone or trickwork are often due to the parsimony of the proprietor, or to his ignorance, soul in total disregard of the advice of Iris architect or builder; and the structure remains a crying disgrace and reproach to all concerned in its erection, amid a source of discomfort and torment, as everything unaesthetic generally is, to all people of fine and cultivated feelings.

But there
