A DICTIONARY of architecture has just been published which has been in course of preparation in England for more than forty years. With the exception of some twenty copies the edition which has been published has been sold to subscribers. As the work is said to be most authentic and complete, it is hoped a new and cheaper edition may be published.





THERE died in one of our Canadian cities recently a gentleman who delighted to call himself the friend of the widow and orphan. His will, which has just been admitted to probate, disposes of property valued at nearly half a million dollars, yet strange to say, not a single dollar thereof has been devoted to the benefit of widows and orphans or any other beneficent object. It is to be regretted that so few bequests are made by men of wealth in Canada for charitable and educational purposes. It is true that some very handsome endowments have been made by wealthy citizens of Montreal to institutions in that city, notably the <building>Royal Victoria Hospital</building> and <building>McGill University</building>, but the number of philanthropists is by no means as large as it ought to be.





A BY-LAW respecting the construction of building scaffolds has recently passed the Toronto City Council. The by-law simply indicates the materials of which scaffolds should be built and stipulates the method of their construction. The City Commissioner is empowered to prosecute any person who may proceed with the erection of buildings using scaffolding which is not constructed in accordance with the by-law, or in the event of finding a scaffold which in his opinion is unsafe, any person who, after due notice, neglects to make the same satisfactory. The penalty for violation of the by-law is not to exceed $50 for each offence. It will be observed that the proposal urged upon the Council some months ago for the appointment of an expensive corps of scaffold inspectors has wisely been disregarded. The by-law in its present form will not be likely to prove very objectionable to

builders.	______________________





AT the time of going to press, the city council of Toronto had not appointed a City Engineer. Unless <person>Mr. Jennings</person> could be induced to again take the position at his former salary, we doubt whether the Council will be able to appoint a more satisfactory man than Mr. <person>C. H. Rust</person>, at present acting City Engineer. Mr. Rust has been connected with the Engineering Department of the city for upwards of fifteen years. For several years he has had the entire charge of the construction of sewers, and in this capacity has done satisfactory work and proved himself to be possessed of the requisite executive ability. If Mr. Rust has given the city good service in the past, and is capable of filling the larger position, it would be unfair to give the appointment to an outsider. Should circumstances occasionally arise calling for engineering experience and ability of the highest order, the temporary assistance of an expert consulting engineer could be obtained. Such occasions are not likely to be frequent, and consequently should not involve large expense.





WE learn from the Brickmaker that there is much indignation expressed by Hudson River brick manufacturers over the action of the United States government in stopping French Canadians from going over the line to work on the brick yards under the Contract Labor Law. It has been the custom for yeats for these men to work in the brick yards during the summer, over 1,000 of them being employed every year. They spend most of their wages in the States, and before going home to work in the woods in winter lay in their supplies. The effect is, the manufacturers say, to cripple the yards, without benefiting the country, for the places of these men are gradually being filled by Arabs from the Holy Land who will carry the money paid them out of the country. The Alien Contract Labor Law, and some other measures recently enacted by the government of the United States, have to a large extent brought the statesmanship of the Republic into contempt before the world. Without attempting to detract from the many admirable characteristics of the American people, it can truthfully be said that as a nation, the United States has stooped to petty meannesses which no other country of importance on the face of the earth would be guilty of. In some instances the self
