John Goettsche, of British Columbia, is investigating the clay deposits in South Dakota with the view at erecting an extensive brick works in that state. Tests are being made of the clays in the vicinity of Brookings, and if the results are satisfactory a. plant may be erected at that place.



A Small Sewage Disposal Plant of considerable interest is described in a recent issue of "Indian Engineering." It was designed by Mr. C. C. James for a leper asylum with 400 inmates near Bombay, where the sewage originally drained into two large cesspools. These became a nuisance, so a disposal farm was laid out with settling tanks for liming the raw sewage, but the lime injured some of the crops and it bad to be abandoned. Finally the land became 1 and the septic system was introduced



preliminary to the land treatment. This has been successful, and the sale of the farm crops yielded last year a profit of 21 per cent. above working expenses. The septic tanks have a capacity of about 19,000 imperial gallons, and the sewage passes through them at a rate of about 20 feet an hour' The leathery scum on the surface is 1 to 3 inches thick and there is some sludge at the bottom. The septic effluent has been used in experiments with a number of filters. One which gave a good result Was made with pieces of coal. Another filler which received raw sewage, was made of pieces of brick with pipes to distribute air through it in accordance with the principles advocated by Colonel Ducat. The sewage was 45 minutes in passing this filter and was well purified by the process.





















For Interior Use





This is the palest and finest varnish of its kind made. It is designed for the very finest



Architectural Work

And especially for natural woods. It will take a very high polish, which it retains for a remarkable length of time.



Zinc White ground in this varnish makes a pure white enamel which can be either rubbed to an egg--shell gloss or finished to a piano polish.
