<article title=" COMPETITION FOR CHURCH DESIGNS " author="">COMPETITION FOR CHURCH DESIGNS.

THE <assoc>Presbyterian Church in Canada </assoc>has determined upon making an effort to improve the architecture of its churches, and with that object proposes to issue a pamphlet containing approved designs with letterpress explaining the same and essays on church architecture.

It is proposed to have a competition of designs for churches as per the list of requirements given herein, and to illustrate those designs which may be deemed of sufficient merit by the experts. it is hoped that there will be such a hearty response on the part of the architects that the committee will be enabled to publish designs suitable to the needs of all congregations. It is to be distinctly understood, however, that only such designs will be illustrated as may be deemed by the experts to possess architectural merit worthy of illustration. In case there should not be a sufficient number of good designs sent in to permit of the publication of the pamphlet, the same will not be issued. The plan and perspective with possibly one elevation, will be illustrated, as it is not desirable to give sufficient drawings to allow of the design being made use of except through the author. This pamphlet will be placed in the hands of representatives of every Presbyterian congregation in Canada, and it is hoped that any congregation proposing to build will select from amongst the designs the one which most neatly fills their requirements, and instruct the author to prepare drawings for the erection of the proposed church at the regular commission

The publication of the pamphlet will at least bring before the notice of congregations proposing to build the names of architects who are competent to design churches of some architectural merit, which should benefit those who have been successful in having their designs illustrated.

The following prizes, namely, $73, $50, and $25. will be given to the three best designs in order of merit, irrespective of the class under which they have been sent in. No money prize will be given to any design which is not of sufficient merit to allow of its being published even though the same should be the best submitted in the competition.

Any architect who would like to send in designs for illustration and who does not care to enter the competition for the prizes. may send in designs, and the same will be published provided they are of sufficient merit in the judgment of the experts.

The experts, three in number, who will decide as to the merits of the designs which may be entitled to the prizes and the designs which may be of sufficient merit to be published, will be selected by the Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>. The decision of the experts will be final on all points.

The excellence of a design will consist in the closeness with which the conditions have been fulfilled, the quality of the designs and the inexpensiveness of erecting the building. No limit has been made as to the cost in any class, as it is desirable that the designer should not be hampered except in so far that he must bear in mind that a good design which is inexpensive is of greater value than an equally good or even better design which will cost more money to erect.

The three designs which may be awarded the prizes will be chosen from among those standing first and second in the different classes. The experts will be instructed to favor the designs for small and inexpensive buildings in preference to those for large and costly ones.

The following drawings will be required General floor plan. two elevations and one perspective. Other drawings may be sent in at the option of the designer. The drawings are to be n black and white to a scale of 8 feet to the inch. The plans and elevations are to be in line only, with the windows blacked in or not as may be preferred by the designer. The perspective should be a thoroughly good drawing, and may be rendered its thought proper by the author (but not in colour). The perspective is to be set up from a plan drawn four feet to an inch. Bad or inferior drawings will not be illustrated, no matter how good the design may be, but an opportunity will be afforded the author to prepare, or have prepared, suitable drawings.

Each competitor is requested to send in a short description of his design, and to state clearly the material which he would use in its erection, together with a statement of its cost. The experts will have a right to correct the estimate of cost placed on any design as may appear to them just. The above statement is to be printed in the pamphlet along with the selected design. together with the name of the author and his business address.

The following is a list of the classes of building which are required to meet the wants of the average congregations in each of the classes in which it has been thought well to divide church buildings

1st Country church to seat from 150 to 200 persons, with one room to be used as vestry and library. Church to he heated by stoves.

2nd. Village church, capacity 250 to 300 persons, with one room to be used as vestry and library. Church to be heated with stoves.

3rd. Large village church, seating 350 to 400 persons, with vestry and library. To be furnace heated.

4th. Small town church, seating 350 to 400 persons, with vestry, library and school room.

600, with vestry, library, school room and kitchen.

7th. Large city church, seating from 1,000 to 1,300. with vestry, library, school rooms and kitchen.

<article title="competition" author="fuller, thomas">CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER" Competition.

THE report of the expert appointed to judge the designs submitted in this competition is as follows

OTTAWA, 18th Nov., 1891.



I duly received the thirteen sets of plans which had been submitted in response to your invitation to students for competitive designs for a suburban cottage to be occupied by a young doing man business daily in the city, owning the lot, seeming $2,000 in cash and having an income of $1,500 per annum. This condition hardly seems to give a definite idea as 10 the outlay to be incurred. and does not appear to have been understood by many of the competitors. After- examination of the various designs the following have been selected

Piapot is given first place. The arrangement of the rooms in this plan are very good, but the entrance and vestibule are too small The elevation is simple in design and well drawn. Altogether, both in plan and design, it appears to be the most  appropriate for a suburban cottage. No perspective sketch.

 "<person>Kata Phusin</person>" is given the second place. The staircases in this design are not so well arranged as those of " <person>Piapot</person>. The

n is simple and appropriate, and the perspective is freely sketched

 "<person>Jack Plane </person>is given the third place. The arrangement of them plan hardly entitles it to this place. the relative position of the dining -room and kitchen is objectionable. and there is no provision for servants stairs. The elevation is plain, and the perspective well drawn.

Kata Phusin is given first place for his perspective.

There is not much evidence of skill in the other designs, and they differ so little in degree that it is not worth while to attempt to grade them.

It occurred to me that in such a competition amongst students, some consideration should have been given to the length of time the students have served in an architects office, and also that a certificate should have accompanied each design, that all the drawings had been made by the competitor without outside assistance. There having been no condition to this effect, and as I had no information on the subject, only the relative merits of the designs have been taken into consideration.

The thirteen sets of plans have been returned to you this day by <firm>Dominion Express Co.</firm> I remain, sir,

Your obedient servant,

<person>THOS. FULLER.</person>
