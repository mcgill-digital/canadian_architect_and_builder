fatal facility with which many things are learned superficially, from laying bricks to legislating for the nation, has filled the land with '' half-baked ' men—men trained for nothing in particular and good for nothing in general.

The practical solution is for employers to revert to the former well-tested system of "articled apprenticeship," and to take a personal interest in training the young men so bound, making this youthful period of life attractive by encouraging friendly competition in technical schools.

Your directors cannot too warmly urge a federation of all the Employers' Associations in corporate union with the Builders' Exchange as a central nucleus, representative of their individual and united interests. By such consolidation we could speak with no uncertain sound in all labor questions. They also ask your co-operation for closer intercourse and more cordial relations with the architects, and would suggest a joint representative conference at an early date to discuss the advisability of a uniform contract; a responsible method of furnishing quantities; the protection of sub-contractors and the amendment of the law as to the unjust responsibilities now resting upon both architect and contractor as to liability for structures.

The need a commodious Builders' Exchange building will be one of urgency in the near future, and your Directors are strongly in favor of a permanent exhibit, wherein sample and desk-space can he rented, as an attractive and beneficial addition to the advantages offered to our members,

<article title=" CURLY GABLES " author="">CURLY GABLES.

To the list of stock features in modern architectural practice which have been pilloried in these columns at

one time and another we think the overuse of the curly gable should be added. The fronts of buildings are disturbed quite enough as a rule without any playful fancy in gables. The curly form has the distinction of antiquity, but we are inclined to regard it more or less with suspicion. It never was a particularly logical use of material. A gable coping requires to be protected against the penetration of water and the consequent disintegration by frost, but the curved and twisting outline of the Dutch gable does not carry off the water quickly enough. These Dutch gables, however, were built of bricks, and the same necessity for care in this respect did not arise as with stone copings. If the mortar which kept the bricks in place was disintegrated it could easily he re-pointed, or the brickwork reset. But with stone the material, once loosened, is irretrievably damaged, and the forms copied to-day from the brick gables of the past are unsuitable with stone coping Apart from this, moreover, the effect of the gable upon the general design of a modern building is more often than not distressing. Whereas the gable end of the Netherlands usually gave relief to a somewhat plain street front of a house of narrow width, modern frontages are wider and generally embrace many more decorative features, containing two or three gables. The curly gable thus creates an unhappy effect. It quarrels with the rest of the front and destroys all restfulness or austerity; the building becoming overloaded. There is a further development in the use of segmental gables. From a practical point of view this form may rank next in efficiency to the straight pointed gable, but we feel that it was more appropriate in its original position— namely, at the end of a barrel roof—than as now commonly employed. The outlines produced by pitched roofs of many little gables and gablets running against segmental gables are not particularly pleasing, and the gables of flattened curve or hog-backed gables are the ugliest and most ludicrous of recent architectural inventions. —Building Journal and Architectural Record.
