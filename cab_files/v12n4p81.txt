ARTIFICIAL SANDSTONE.

AN artificial sandstone made at Uccle-Calevoet, Belgium, is a silicate of lime obtained by imitating the supposed conditions of nature. A mixture of 8o per cent. of clean coarse sand and 20 per cent of hydraulic quicklime is placed in an iron mould, which is introduced into a boiler filled with hot water, and is kept for three days under a pressure of six atmospheres and a temperature of' about 329 degrees F. The resulting block is at first soft, but hardens quickly in air. The stone is absolutely homogeneous, absorbs little water, has four times the crushing strength of French freestone, and at the cost of ten cents per cubic foot is cheaper than the natural product.
