THE ONLY CONCRETE Building Block forming continuous "dead air" space (or hollow) wall, the entire length of the wall, including angles. Well 'bonded in wall. Warm in winter. Cool in Summer. FIRE, FROST and WEATHER proof. EASY to build, having all the facilities of brick or stone work, for bedding plates, sills and bind timber, foe joists. &c. IRRESPECTIVE of face work. EASY to manufacture, no expensive machinery being required. Profitable to user and producer.

If a PARTIAL air apace in a wall is beneficial (in any way), the WHOLE, or s continuous air space must be MORE SO.

The ATLAS BUILDING BLOCK is rendered more DURABLE and TENACIOUS than ordinary concrete by the use of I. N. D. Chemical Compound

—a cheap and profitable mixture to use in all concrete construction (at a cost of 40 cents per cubic yard.)
