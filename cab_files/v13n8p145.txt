<article title="Architectural Excursions" author="">An effort was made to induce a number Architectural of architects of Toronto to pay a visit

Excursions.

to Buffalo on Dominion Day. They



were to have been met on arrival by members of the Buffalo chapter A. 1. A. and shown the most interesting of the buildings of the city. Unfortunately, the project had to be abandoned because a sufficient number of the members of the profession in Toronto did not respond to the invitation. In view of the nearness of Toronto to a number of large American cities, it is to be regretted that the members of the Ontario Association of Architects do not organize and carry out every year an excursion such as the one proposed. It might he made a benefit to the members individually and to the Association as a body. There is required, however, a greater disposition than has been shown by members of the Association in the past to serve the interests of the profession as a whole at the cost of individual convenience.



<article title="The Heating and Ventilation of Schools" author="">A special committee of the Toronto Public School Board was recently appointed to collect data and report upon the best method of warming and ventilating school buildings, in order that the information might be available for use in the construction of a number of new schools now in course of erection. The committee communicated on the subject with the representatives of school boards in twenty-one cities in Canada and the United States, and invited opinions from several sanitary experts. In every instance replies were received. These show 13 systems in use in 525 buildings. The number of buildings in which each system is used is as follows



Smead, 115 ; hot air furnaces, III ; steam, direct, So

The Heating and Ventilation of Schools.
