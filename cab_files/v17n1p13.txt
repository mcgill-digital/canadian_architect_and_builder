<article title=" STRENGTHENED	CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS." author="">STRENGTHENED	CONCRETE FOUNDATIONS.



An interesting departure in building engineering is recorded in the "Centralblatt der Bauverwaltung." The article in question deals with the construction of the new Berlin-Wedding law courts in general, and the laying of the foundations in particular. The unstable nature of the ground necessitated some system of foundation that could be relied upon to give adequate support to the vast edifice. After serious consideration and exhaustive experiments with various systems, strengthened concrete piles of triangular section with cut-off corners were decided upon. These consist of hard gravel and best Portland in the proportion of three parts of the river ballast to one of Portland, and varying in length from 17 to 26 feet. The strengthening consists of three ¼- inch thick iron rods, with blunted lower ends and connected at 10-inch intervals by T rods. Carefully mixed in a pug-mill, the slightly - wetted concrete is spread in vertical wooden moulds in 8-inch layers, and compressed to four inches. To insure uniformity of incorporation the surface of each proceeding layer is roughened previous to adding fresh doses of concrete and fixing the T pieces. The completed pile is then left to itself for twelve to twenty-four hours, and constantly and abundantly moistened during the succeeding seven or eight days after which they are removed from the moulds and again watered for the next eight or ten days. By then the piles have sufficiently hardened to admit of transport, and in another ten or twelve days are ready for use. In the instance described, the piles were driven into the ground with the aid of a steam pile-drive, with a 2½ -ton ram allowed a fall of feet 6 inches. To prevent damage to the heads of the piles, cushions consisting of sheets of lead and iron and timber packing, held together by an iron band, were interposed.

<article title=" COLUMNS AND WINDOWS " author="">COLUMNS AND WINDOWS.



Although some object to the applying a small order either in columns or pilasters with a regular entablature, sometimes with the usual architrave also surrounding the aperture of the window, at others, riot as being inconsistent with the original purpose of columns, their impropriety is at least redeemed by richness and beauty. At all events the impropriety is not so great as that of applying small orders successively to the different storeeys of a building, thereby rendering diminutive parts which, if introduced, ought to be proportioned to the entire edifice, whereas in the case of columns to windows, they show themselves to be intended only as decorations, and though really small yet being distinct and independent features, instead of giving an air of little ness to the entire composition they rather give greater dignity and importance to the windows. As to the actual effect produced by them that depends upon the judgment and taste with which such decoration is applied. Windows of this kind are certainly not suited for any except astylar composition, since if there be also a large general order to the facade, while the columns to the windows look rather insignificant by comparison, there is too much of repetition and monotony, and the whole decoration seems to consist only of columns of different sizes. Still worse is the effect when, as is the case with the Atlas Office, Cheapside, the building consists of more than one order, because then as the windows must be large in proportion to those orders, the columns to the windows cause the others to look petty and the whole to appear both crowded and confused.

The camera has not been employed hitherto, so tar as we know, as a weapon in strikes. The innovation is to be credited to the masons of Geneva. A great many of them are on strike, but, as happens in all countries, the steadiest men prefer to work. The Swiss laws are severe against any interference with the liberty of the subject, and the physical-force policy with which we are familiar in Great Britain dare not be exercised. There is however, no law against taking snapshots of the operatives who have no liking for idleness and of exhibiting the prints as the portraits of cowards who are disloyal to trade organisations. If the men are sensitive, such records may have a terrorising effect and in that way the end of the strikers will he attained. But in the experiment is ever tried here it is to be hoped summary methods will he adopted for dealing with the perpetrators. Builders' Reporter.
