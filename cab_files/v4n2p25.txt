THE PROPER METHOD OF JUDGING COMPETITIVE PLANS.

QUEBEC, Jan. 31st, 1891.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



DEAR SIR,---AS a subscriber to the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER allow me to put before you the following questions

in a competition for plans of building, is it right that one of the competitors sign his name to his plan ? In such a case would it be right to have only one judge well known by competitors ?

Is it not a well known rule that when a plan is signed it should be put aside?



In a case like the one described, do you think if the judge allowed the first prize to the signed plan, it should be considered a just and final decision



An answer through	your esteemed journal will oblige, Yours respectfully,

D.	QUELLETE





 In answer to our correspondent's inquiries, the name of the author of a competitive design should not he attached to his drawings, and when so attached, such drawings should be ruled out as being informal. It would manifestly be unfair to allow a signed drawing to remain in the competition, and even more unjust to award to such drawing a premium. The competitors thus unjustly dealt with in a competition would have the right to insist upon the matter being reconsidered and adjusted in a proper and equitable manner.----EDITOR C. A. & B.]





TORONTO MASTER PLUMBERS' ASSOCIATION.

TWICE a year at least the members of the above organization and their friends count upon having a time of enjoyment, and up to the present they have not been disappointed. In the summer the festivities take the form of a picnic at some of the neighboring resorts, and in the winter a dinner.

The latter event took place this year at "The Hub" restaurant. The attendance was not as large as could have been desired, but there was no lack of enthusiasm and good-fellowship.

Mr. Joseph Wright, the newly-elected President, presided, and gracefully performed the duties of the position. There

present representing the other branches of the building trades Mr. John Goddard Mr. Win. Simpson and Mr. Lockwood, The manufacturers and supply men were represented by Messrs. Forester, Bayles, and Barsman. Messrs. ONeiland Kirk, plumbing inspectors, were also among the guests.

The remarks of the various speakers went to show that the benefits of association are felt to be great, nevertheless the fact was deplored that a larger proportion of the employers in the plumbing and other trades do not avail themselves of these benefits by becoming members and actively promoting the interests of the trades organizations.

Songs were sung at intervals during the evening by Messrs. Whitelaw, McEwen, Ritchie, Jr., Ritchie, Sr., and Sim.
