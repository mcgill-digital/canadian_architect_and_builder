<article title=" PRODUCT ION OF CEMENT IN CANADA " author="">PRODUCT ION OF CEMENT IN CANADA.

From a Report of the Geological Survey of Canada.



The production of natural rock cement which in 1904 had decreased to 56,814 barrels, valued at

$50,247, fell off in 1905 to the comparatively small amount of 16,184 barrels, valued at $10,274. This was made by three firms in Ontario.

The production of Portland cement, however, continues to increase steadily. Thirteen companies were operating plants during 1905 with a total daily capacity of about 8,ooo barrels, viz. ; one in Nova Scotia, two in Quebec, nine in Ontario and one in British Columbia, while another in Ontario was engaged in reconstruction work.

Detailed statistics of production in 1904 and 1905 are as follows

	1904.	1905.

Portland cement sold	brls	910,358	$1,346,548

	manufactured... "	908,990	1,533,628

Stock on band Jan	113,419	112,086

	Dec. 3T	112,051	299,166

Value of cement sold	1,287,992	$1,913,740



The average price per barrel at the works in 1905 was $1.42, being only a fraction of a cent higher than the average price in 1904.

The imports of Portland into Canada in 1905 were:â€”

Six months ending June	cwt.	1,043,659	$ 405,182

	December..	1,470,306	509,422

	Total	2,513,965	$ 914,610



This is equivalent to 718,275 barrels of 350 pounds each at an average price per barrel of $1.27. The duty is twelve and a half cents per hundred pounds.

The imports in 1904 were equivalent to 784,630 barrels of 350 pounds each valued at $1,061,056, on an average price per barrel of $1.35.

As there is very little cement exported from Canada, the consumption of this product in the country In 1905, would be approximately 1,346,548 barrels of home product and 718,275 barrels of imported, or a total of 2,064,823 barrels.









Luck waits for something to turn up; labor, with keen eyes and strong will, will turn something. Luck lies in bed and wishes to receive news of a legacy, labor turns out at six o'clock, and with busy pen or ringing hammer, lays the foundation of a competence. Luck whines ; labor whistles. Luck rules on chances; labor on character.
