THE OLD-STYLE "BOXED-IN-BATH" MUST GO.

In order to hasten the consummation of the above fact, we are placing on the market a Bath to be known as   









STEEL-CLAD No.2



		List Price, each	$23.00

	___	The material and workmanship

	______ ______	in this new line is exactly the same

		as in our other lines, but as we wil1

		make the No. 2 in less variety of

	__	styles, we are thus enabled to re-

		duce the price. 



WRITE FOR DESCRIPTIVE GIRCULAR.

	

PLEASE NOTE—we will still continue to manufacture our regular lines of STEEL-CLAD BATHS as the No. 2 is not in any way intended to be a substitute for these, but merely enables all 





$

parties to have a SANITARY BATH without any more

expense than the ordinary boxed Bath.
