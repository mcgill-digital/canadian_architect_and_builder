It is by doing that we learn to do, by overcoming that we learn to overcome. Without earnestness, no man is ever great. He may bc one of the cleverest of men, he may be brilliant, entertaining, popular, but he will want weight. No soul-moving picture was ever painted that had not in it the depths of shadow.
