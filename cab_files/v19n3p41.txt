" author="">MONTREAL NOTES.

The approaching season promises to be a busy one for the building trades in Montreal. As last year the banking businesses continue to push forward in what is to them good investment and advertisement. The Royal Bank proposes to erect, in St. James Street, an imposing building, ninety feet in height, with a front of white marble. The dominating feature is to be an Ionic colonnade with pillars forty feet in height. The building is to become the head office of the bank. It consists only of three storeys which will he devoted to banking purposes. The architect is Mr. <person>H. C. Stone</person>. The <firm>Dominion Guarantee Company</firm> is to erect, at the corner of St. James St. and St. Michaels Lane, a three-storey office building which has been designed by Messrs. <firm>Ross & Macfarlane</firm>. The City and District Savings Bank is to build a new branch office at the corner of Ontario Street and Maisonneuve Street. Mr. A. 11. Lapierre is the architect. The new branch of Molsons Bank, at the corner of St.. Catherine Street and Stanley Street, from the designs of Messrs. <firm>Finley and Spence</firm>, is now completed ; and the Bank of Quebec, at the corner of St. Catherine Street and Amherst St., by Messrs. <firm>Cox and Amos</firm>, is rapidly approaching completion.

Churches seem to have started on a sort of stampede from the central parts of the town to the outlying quarters. The Church of the Messiah, on Beaver Hall Hill and occupying the site of the original Beaver Hall, is now being converted, or shall we say apostatized to baser uses. The building was not without a real if humble architectural merit, though sadly marred by a tin spire and wooden traceries simulating stone. Its site on the salient portion of the bend of the road rising steeply from Victoria Square is one of charming possibilities. Nothing however need be hoped for here at present, as the church seems to be in process of being cut and chopped about to suit some kind of manufacturing business. The new church of the Messiah is to be built on Sherbrooke Street, near Simpson Street.

The Emmanuel Congregational Church is to have a new building on Drummond Street near Sherbrooke Street. The work was entrusted to the firm of Saxe and Archibald as the result of a limited competition one of the first competitions, we suppose, to be conducted according to the new code of competitions recommended by the P.Q.A.A. which is thus beginning to bear good fruit. <person>Mr. Darling</person>, of Messrs. Darling and Pearson, of Toronto, was the assessor. The tower of this church, as shown on the competitive drawings, is the choragic monument of Lysicrates and, as the front porch is, within a little, the Erechtheum it promises to be a model of all the architectural virtues, neatly bound together. It is a little disappointing after this to find that the material is only to be light grey brick with sandstone trimmings. The seating capacity of the building is to be one thousand persons. The scheme includes large Sunday school and lecture hall and the cost is to be in the neighbourhood of $80,000. In several other cases congregations are discussing the advisability of moving their tabernacles to points where they may fairly expect to he within walking distance of their members. The Italian colony is to build, at the corner of Dorchester Street and St. Timothy Street, a church and school,

on which they are preparing to spend about $75,000. The demand for apartment houses continues unabated ; at least new projects go on to development. The Linton estate, on Sherbrooke Street, has not yet begun operations in this line ; but it is understood that quite a large block, to cost $750,000, is to be erected here. At the corner of Pine Avenue and Durocher Streets "The Pine Avenue Apartments" are about to he built, providing accommodation for thirty-five families. The architects are Messrs. Finley and Spence. The materials will be red brick and white sandstone. It is estimated to cost $150,000.

An important work of a utilitarian kind will be a new warehouse for the <building>Terminal Warehouse & Cartage Co., Limited,</building> a building to cost 200,000 dollars. It is to be erected between Grey Nun and King streets below Commons. There will be six storeys, all of fireproof construction, no wood being employed; windows and doors being of iron. The walls will be of brick; the total floor area 120,000 square feet. A special feature of the building will be the wine vaults. Messrs. <firm>Marchand & Haskell </firm>are the architects.

Concerning the additions to be made to the <building>Windsor Hotel</building>, to be built on the site of the old <building>Windsor Hall </building>and adjoining buildings, one is glad to find that fireproof structure is being aimed at. The quantity of iron piping spreading like some strange creepers over so many down-town buildings, blossoming into water curtain nozzles in front of cornices and windows, bears witness to some hard thinking being done on the subject of fireproofing just now. The Hotel building is to be nine stories high and the drawings show a roof with high pitched curve, of a type which our reading of the building act had led us to believe was prohibited in Montreal, owing to danger to the public from ice falling from the eaves, In the matter of design the elevations do not aspire to much. The architects are Messrs. <firm>Hardenburgh & Bradford L. Gilbert</firm>, of New York. Their local confederates are Messrs. <firm>Hutchison & Wood</firm>. Not unnaturally the placing of this work has re-awakened to some extent the old question as to whether United States architects should not be excluded from practising in Canada till such time as this amiable republic shall see fit to permit Canadians to practice in their free and enlightened reservations.

The <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects </assoc>has appointed a Committee on City Improvement. This consists of <person>Prof. Nobbs</person>, chairman ,Messrs.<person>J. R. Gardiner</person>, <person>J. 0. Marchand</person>, <person>F. Maxwell</person>, <person>W. S. Maxwell </person>and <person>J. Venne</person>. This Committee is putting itself in communication with the City Council and all associations interested in the subject. By this means the Association seems in a fair way to obtaining an effective influence in civic projects. Already the long discussed question of the mountain look-out has been referred to this Committee, and the standing of the members composing it is a guarantee that such matters will be treated in a broad intelligent spirit, free from suspicion of private interest. Some of the bodies which are taking an interest in the Committee's work are the <assoc>Montreal Fine Arts Association </assoc>and the <assoc>Parks & Playgrounds Association</assoc>. The latter body, which has lately been increasing in influence, has recently been applying for powers to hold property on an extensive scale, and is a society that exists purely for the benefit it can be to the public.
