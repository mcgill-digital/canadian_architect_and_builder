March, 1893	THE CANADIAN	ARCHITECT	41



the magnificent cathedrals of the middle ages or the temples of a much earlier date, that the architects of to-day could not produce such work. Under present financial circumstances, certainly they could not. People are aghast at the wasteful expenditure of money if a large modern church should cost $50,000 dollars But this amount has to he multiplied by one hundred before we get into cathedral figures at all. The same holds good in other classes of buildings. And we are nut pourer, hut much richer than they were, only they did not seem to think there was so much honor in having a long string of figures dangling after their names, as in spending their money for the public good. And the same pemiriousness is observable in works of national character, and which are paid for out of the public purse; so that while architects have now a much larger scope for the exercise of their abilities, they are restrained and hampered by the very limited funds usually placed at their disposal.

The outlook, however, is much brighter to-day than it was a quarter of a century ago. There is a tendency among architects to break away from the old lines and to give to their general design anti detail a character more in consonance with our own time. The fart also that architects are now expected to erect a very large building for a very small sum of money may not be without its beneficial results. If it forces upon us the observance of simplicity in everything connected with a building, it will have taught us one of the most essential qualities of true art.

A good plait of preventing tools from rusting is the simple preparation employed by Professor <person>Olmstead, </person>of Vale College, for the preservation of scientific apparatus, and which he long ago published for the general good, declining to have it patented. It is made by the slow melting together of six or eight parts of lard to one of resin, stirring till cool. This remains semi-fluid, ready for use, the resin preventing rancidity and supplying an air-tight film. Rubbed on a bright surface ever so thinly it protects and preserves the polish effectually, and it can be wiped off neatly clean, if ever desired, as from a knife blade; or it may be thinned with coal oil or benzine.
