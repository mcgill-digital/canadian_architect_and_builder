NOTES.



A combination is said to be in process of formation to control the worlds supply of window glass.



Contracts aggregating about $11,000,000 for construction work on the buildings and grounds of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition will be awarded about December 1. About $7,000,-000 of this amount will be expended on the buildings and about



$4,000,000 on the grounds. The first contracts to be let will be for the four big exhibit buildings which, with their surroundings, will, it is estimated, cost about $4,000,000. The main buildings will be larger than those of any previous exposition in Europe or America. Some will exceed similar buildings at former expositions by over 25 per cent.

Official intimation has just reached Mr. Edwin 0. Sachs, chairman of the British Fire Prevention Committee, that a large silver portrait medal accorded by Her Majesty, the German Em:



press, in connection with the Fire Congress in June last, has been presented to the Executive of the Committee as a mark of appreciation for the services rendered by that body in the demonstration of scientific and economic aspects of fire protection. It will be remembered that a deputation of the committee comprising Mr. Edwin 0. Sashs, (chairman), Mr. Ellis Marsland, Mr. F.

R. Farrow, and C. E. Goad, accompanied by the secretary and engineer, visited Berlin in the summer, and that an important exhibit of technical models and photographs was loaned to the German authorities for the exhibition held in connection with the Congress.
