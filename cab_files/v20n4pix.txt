WONDERFUL DEPOSIT OF B. C. MARBLE.



Recently we gave particulars of an immense find of fine marble near Chilliwack, B. C. In response to our enquiries, the owner, Mr. James Patterson, has written us as follows

"The marble property was discovered and is owned by myself. The deposit is enormous, and is almost pure carbonate of lime. Mr. M. J. Hersey, of Montreal, gave analysis of 16-/000 pure lime. Both thin and thick beded is found. Almost arty kind of marble known to the trade is represented in these immense ledges, of which there are three 1000 feet long and 300 feet high. A few feet from the surface the marble is free from

checks or fractures, except a few wide distances from each other, which does not impair its value for taking out large blocks. I am about to commence to open out the thin beded and test it on the local market. This is an even colored dark blue variety and very hard, taking a high polish without the use of acids, being very valuable for monumental work. The location is at East Chilliwack, at the foot hills, in the midst of the finest agricultural section in the Fraser Valley. The recently surveyed R. R. line, known as the V. V. & E., is close to the property, besides tributaries of the Fraser river, making transportation by water convenient. However it will take some time to open up the quarry and make a start."



When this marble is placed on the market we expect to give a full description of same.
