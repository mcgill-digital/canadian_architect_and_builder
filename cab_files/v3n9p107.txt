THE HANSEN



Salt-Glazed Terra-Cotta Weather-Protecting Chimney-Topping.

Patented in the United States and Canada.

























Indorsed by Architects throughout the country; are mainly designed to

replace the common corbeled chimney top; for the PROPER PROTECTION of chimney masonry from the usual EARLY DESTRUCTION of

same by the action of rain and frost. These toppings are manufactured by steam press and dies, same as first-class salt-glazed sewer pipe, for keeping in stock in same manner, and aa made in pieces (see diagrams) present the CHEAPEST, MOST

PRACTICAL ever READY and LASTING material for bricklayers' use in topping out chimneys. Deducting value of masons material and time saved when using these toppings, their COST PER FLUE does not exceed 50 to 60 cents that of common brick tops, which secures absolutely PERMANENT chimney masonry, and saves annoyance and REPAIR EXPENSES, the usual and too frequent experience of owners.
