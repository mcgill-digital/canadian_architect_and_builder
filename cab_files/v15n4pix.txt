<building>THE HOUSE THAT JERRY BUILT</building>.



This is the man for whom it was planned,

Aid this is the scamp who put it in hand,

And filled in the footings with stones and sand

With no cement, and said, "Its grand!'·

When building the house that Jerry built.



These are the bricks, as soft as cheese,

That broke in two if you chanced to sneeze

Said Jerry " The man what don't like these,

Lor, blow me ! he will be 'ard to please

They'll last for months— unless there's a breeze" In the beautiful house that Jerry built.



These are the windows of packing-case wood,

Said Jerry "Of course it's understood

It'll he extra for windows of real wood

These 'ere are special, and much too good

To go in the house that Jerry built.

This is the rubbish that blocked tip the drain.

Said Jerry: "Now don't you labor in vain;

Fill it in—it'll never be seen again,

It's ten to one he won't complain

The cellar is meant to collect the rain

That falls on the house that <person>Jerry</person> built.



This is the elegant panelled door,

With the natural finish left by the saw,

Which warped till its panels fell out on the floor.

He bought it for six shillings—but " Lor

Said Jerry, "it looks worth ten bob more

Too good for the house that Jerry built.



These are the slates—some small, some great,

Most were crooked but a few were straight,

Each kept in place by the next one's weight;

Said Jerry, instructively, to his mate

"I saves my nails and I trusts to fate"

When building the house that Jerry built.



These are the locks he bought for a song, They work three times and then go wrong. He said : "It's lucky they ain't too strong There'll be some repairs a-coming along"

To be done to the house that Jerry built



This is the price the purchaser paid

(He'd made some cash in the grocery trade);

" Dirt cheap," said the man of trowel and spade, As the check in his horny hand was laid

"And a better house has never been made"

For the price of the house that Jerry built.



This is the band that came up the road;

The drummer drummed and the cornet blowed,

And as it passed, the house like a flash

Fell suddenly down with a fearful crash,

And all that remained was a heap of smash

And the owner said words like "blow' and "dash,

And he stared in amaze at tile heap of dust,

While the more he stared the more he cussed

At the vanished house that Jerry built.
