carried out as follows, as described in The Scientific American (New York, April 13)

"Some blocks of one-to-one Portland cement sand concrete were molded in a common metal water pail, with a piece of two inch wrought iron pipe placed vertically within the blocks to a depth of about eight inches. When the blocks were three years old, one of them was placed in a tank of sea water, and another in a tank of fresh water, and direct current was fed to the iron pipes in the center of each block, the negative electrode consisting of a piece of sheet iron placed in the tank. A third block, similar to the other two, was placed in a tank of sea water, but was not subjected to the electric current. After a period of thirty days the last named block was found to be in perfect condition, and the embedded pipe was perfectly bright. But the two other blocks, which had developed cracks during the test, were easily broken open; yellowish deposits were found in the cracks, where the concrete had deteriorated to such a degree that it could be cut easily with a knife: and the -pipes were considerably corroded, showing a loss of weight of over two per cent. Similar results were obtained in tests with blocks of standard Rosendale cement, made in the same mould although in this case the blocks were tested thirty days after they had been made."

Â·	That these results are of profound significance is asserted by the writer, who is of opinion that they call

for careful investigation on the part of concrete engineers, and the provision of special insulation in all cases where embedded steel, or reinforcing material, is liable to attack by stray currents near wet foundations. He concludes:

"The whole subject ofelectrolysis, whicli, because of the exaggerated use to which it has been put by a sensational press, has not received from technical men the attention which it deserves, should be made the subject of a searching investigation with a view to determining the laws and limits of this form of corrosion."
