IN the Competition for a museum at Cairo, mention of which was recently made in these Columns, 73 designs were submitted. The Technical Committee appointed to examine the designs, have recommended that BO first premium should he awarded, as none of the designs came sufficiently near meeting the requirements. They further recommended that four designs which most nearly fulfil the requirements, should be awarded a premium of £225 each, and that the second premium he given to No. 62, by <person>Mr. Trauchet</person>. Nos. 8, 28, 33 and 71 are given honorable mention. All the awards go to French architects.



A COMPANY composed of leading citizens of Montreal is applying for incorporation for the purpose of perfecting arrangements for an International Exhibition to be held in that city from the 24th of May to the 31st of October 1896. The local architects are already engaged on the preparation of designs for the necessary buildings. Mr. <person>Joseph H. Stiles</person>, who was a member of the Committee of Awards in connection with the recent California Exposition, is Director General of the enterprise An effort will shortly be made to interest every section of the Dominion in the undertaking. The promoters have taken this definite action after having visited Europe anti satisfied themselves that Great Britain will exhibit In view of the ability, financial and otherwise, of the gentlemen who have taken this important matter in hand, there is little reason to doubt its ultimate success. If successfully carried out it should prove to be of incalculable benefit to Canada. The present seems an opportune time, when the commercial depression is lifting, to successfully launch the enterprise.



ARCHITECTURAL competitions are of late becoming more frequent. There seems to be a growing disposition en the part of church and other corporations to secure designs in this way, the object being to get their work done more cheaply. The falling off in building enterprises, consequent upon the commercial depression, has been favorable to the growth of the competition evil. Architects with little or nothing to do, have been tempted to disregard the ethics of the profession, anti to enter competitions, depending on the slightest possible hope that they would derive some benefit therefrom. The apparent willingness of a certain number of architects to enter these competition has not only helped to propagate the evil, but has encouraged the promoters to more and more disregard the rights of competitors in framing the conditions. As is illustrated by an article published on another page concerning a competition on the Pacific Coast, architects are now invited to submit designs in competition without any provision being made to secure a proper award. They are distinctly told that the right is reserved to reject any or all the designs submitted, and no guarantee is given that in the event of a design being chosen, the author will be given the Carrying out of the work. In other words the competitor is asked to place himself completely at the mercy of a body of men who in nine cases out of ten have not the slightest knowledge of the proper manner of conducting a competition, and who want to be at liberty to do as they please regardless of the rights of competitors.
