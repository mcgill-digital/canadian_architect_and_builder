<article title=" TWENTY-SECOND ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE ROYAL CANADIAN ACADEMY OF ARTS " author="">

This exhibition, which is now being held in the Gallery of the Ontario Society of Artists, King St. West, Toronto, is one of the best representative exhibitions held by Canadian painters that we have had the pleasure of seeing. It embraces the work of nearly all the members, and from this collection we believe will be chosen the works to represent Canadian art at the Pan-American Exhibition. Many of the pictures are old friends, especially those by local painters. The eastern artists, however, add to the interest and enjoyment of the Exhibition. We have two excellent portraits by R. Harris, the president of the Academy, and also one particularly charming thing The Banjo Boy.' The



Landscape ' by Mr. Brymner is forcible and masterly. We have two pictures from the brush of Horatio Walker, now residing in New York, one of which is a perfect little gem and a rare treat. Another large picture, " The Rathers' by Blair Bruce, residing in Paris, France, is breezy, clever and decorative. Miss Florence Carlyle contributes an interior called Golden Rod, from the standpoint of light arid color an admirable little bit. Homer Watson is ably represented, rich in color, gem-like in quality, but evidently influenced by tire old Constable school. A little canvass by St. Charles entitled Red Man "is a daring arid exceedingly clever little piece of technique.

 John Hammond, of Montreal, contributes one of his misty dawns, always poetic and sweet, arid Maurice Cullen one of his sunny pastorals. In water colors we have two excellent things by Win. Brymner, of Montreal, arid one by a deceased member, Charles Moss, whose removal is most deeply mourned, as he was really one of tire most promising young academicians.

Space does not permit of dealing with this matter but summarily. We therefore take the liberty of drawing attention to merely  few of the contributors from the eastern provinces who are riot

so frequently seen in Toronto. Our local members have been commented on in the past, and are old and highly esteemed friends.

We are glad to announce that Mr. Dyoririet has been elected a member of the Royal Canadian Academy.
