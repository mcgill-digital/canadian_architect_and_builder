PUBLICATIONS.

In order to disseminate as widely as possible a better knowledge of explosives and their employment and thus reduce the risk and promote efficiency of blasting operations, the Toronto Bureau of Mines has just issued a pamphlet of 136 pages dealing with this important subject. The author is Prof. Courtenay DeKaib of the Kingston School of Mining, who is also Inspector of Mines for Eastern Ontario, The Commissioner of Crown Lands is taking steps to place a copy of this work in the hands of every mine and quarry manager, captain and foreman in Ontario, free of charge, in the hope that a perusal of its contents may lead to a diminution in the number of accidents resulting from the use of explosives. Other persons may procure a copy for the nominal charge of 25 cents on application to Thos. W. Gibson, Department of Crown Lands, Toronto.



The Amherst Red Stone Quarry Co. have turned out material for a number of large and well known buildings the last few years, including the Baptist church in Amherst erected a few years ago at a cost of $35,000; the handsome brick and stone Presbyterian church on the same street which was built last year at a cost of $23,000; the new Bank of Nova Scotia now about completed in Sussex, N. B., (this building is entirely of dressed stone and it has been found that the Amherst red stone can be worked with great ease) the Merchants' Bank of Halifax in Truro and

the Roy building in Halifax contain this stone. It was used in the new Portland school house in St. John, and considerable has been sent recently to D. J. Leonys & Son, Granby, Que.

It is well fitted with lifting apparatus with engines of 6o h.p. It is under the management of Jas. Donald of Amherst.
