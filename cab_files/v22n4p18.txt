From a patriotic reader signing himself Canuck the following letter has been received:

Beautiful Buildings at Shepherds Bush.

The buildings for the Franco-British Exhibition at Shepherd's Bush already make an imposing white city, according to reports from the old country. The work is under the direction of Mr. Imre Kiralfy, who in an incredibly short time has called into being some twenty palaces, which now cover time 140 acres of exhibition ground, and are almost ready for the exhibits to be put into them. The Mail and Empire of Toronto, in a special dispatch on the subject, says:

The first sod was cut less than fifteen months ago. Then the place was a desert, a gloomy stretch of mud and rank grass. Now it is a stately town, with wide

roads and pleasant gardens and a broad canal meandering through it, with fine buildings at every turn, each vista revealing fresh beauties, and every promise of being ready for the public to gaze upon its wonders at the beginning of May.

It is bard to believe when you see the palaces glitter in the sunlight that they are not solid construction of stone. The plaster worn is marvelous. and all the details, as well as the broad outlines of design, are really in excellent taste. It reminds one now of the Chicago World's Fair, now of the Paris Exhibition. Certainly, nothing so good of its kind has ever been seen in England before.

The Court of honor will be one of the chief admiration spots for the crowds which will throng the place during the summer months. Around an immense basin fed by tile canal are vast halls of Oriental aspect. Their cupolas and minarets form a delicate fretted pattern against the sky. Their dignified solidity and restful architecture breathe an ageless majesty and calm. At one end a cascade of water will ripple down over crystal steps illuminated from beneath with changing colors like some gigantic kaleidoscope. Especially forward are the Colonial Palaces, in which the King, who is to open the Exhibition, takes a particular interest.

Many Buildings Will be Needed.

Building operations in the West should be stimulated this summer by the demands of the new settlers coming in from the United States. An increase of sixty-one per cent, in the immigration of Americans to Canada took

place during the months of January and February of this year, as compared with 1907. The success which has attended tile efforts (if other farmers from the Republic who have located in the Dominion within the past few years has been responsible for the larger influx, and has been sufficient to offset the effects of all the stories set. afloat, by interested parties who have desired to discredit the Canadian West.

A dispatch from St. Paid, Minn., says: The volume of traffic from the United States into Canada at present has astonished even those railway officials who had expected a revival of the ''American invasion.'' The rush northward is out of all proportion to the elaborate plans made by the roads with branches into British territory to handle the spring rush. On the ''Soo'' line alone five special trains, loaded with American home seekers and their household goods, and even stock, arrived for trans-shipment over that road into Canada. Part of this traffic will be moved via Winnipeg and the balance through Portal.

The Chicago Great Western has brought a ten-car train in from Iowa, The Burlington, two from Nebraska and one from Iowa, and the Rock Island one from Kansas and Oklahoma, The destinations of these families are said to be Northern Saskatchewan and Alberta. The Battleford and Prince Albert districts in Saskatchewan are largely favored, lout ''anything north of the line" seems to be the cry. A dispatch from North Portal says: All trains arriving from the south are heavily loaded with settlers and landseekers; they are bound for all parts of Saskatchewan and Alberta, and are a good class of settlers. A number of steam plowing outfits are coining in daily.





Plans are being prepared for the erection of a grand stand on the Plains of Abraham, Quebec, for the pageant production. The stand will be built to seat between 15,000 and 20,000 people.
