Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



DEAR SIR, I would be glad if you could answer the following questions in the next number of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



What is a fair charge by percentage for preliminary drawings (plans and elevations) specifications and estimates of proposed alterations and repairs to a large public building built of free stone The building was erected about 50 years ago and is in a very bad condition, parts of the work being almost dangerous. There was included in the preliminary work a careful report upon the present condition of the building, and the cost was figured at $18,000. The work, however, was never carried out.

Yours truly,

<person>C.B. CHAPPELL</person>.



[The charge for full professional services for a public building is 521216f the cost of the building when completed. In case of the abandonment of the work, the commission is calculated from the estimated cost of the building, and is for the degrees of partial service as follows

1. Preliminary studies, 1/5 of the full commission as above.

2. Preliminary studies and general drawings and specifications sufficient for estimate and contract, 1/2 of the full commission as above.

3. Preliminary studies, general drawings, specifications and details, 4/5 of the full commission as above.

For the alteration of premises a charge in excess of the above is made for surveying, measuring and plotting an existing building, and for such other extra work as may arise in the preparation for or supervision of alterations. This charge is based upon the time occupied.—EDITOR C. A. & B.]



<article title="Correspondence – Hamilton A Reply to Doric" author="">A REPLY TO "DORIC."

HAMILTON, Oct. 22nd, 1892.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT and BUILDER



SIR,—In reference to  Doric's letter in your last issue, I must say there was no intention on my part to injure anyone's reputation such an idea never entered my head. The two buildings referred to have been the principal jobs here this season, and I simply criticized the carving as a matter of course; as far as that goes, I strongly reiterate what was said in the notes, and feel quite satisfied that competent judges would do the same.

"Doric" says . "No carving was done on <person>Mr. Tuckett</person>'s residence until the 15th of September, several days after your valuable journal reached me." The ARCHITECT and BUILDER was not published till Saturday, September 17th, and, as you know, the notes were in your possession at least one month before that date. At the time these were written I positively state a large amount of the carving on Mr. Tuckett's residence was not only started, but very nearly finished, if not quite ; there has been nightly little done on some of it since then

As far as the drawing referred to is concerned, I had not the slightest idea that the sculptor had laughed at or in any way criticized it till reading " Doric's" letter ; it quite surprised me. I contend, however that there is nothing crude or impracticable in it, and am quite ready to have my copy of the drawing inspected. The idea is certainly somewhat new, and doubtless it was reluctance to leave the rut of old ideas that caused the sculptor's hilarious criticism.

In conclusion let me say, that although this sculptor may have done highly artistic work on many other buildings in

Canada, it does not in the least alter the present case ; in fact it is more to his discredit that this work should have been turned Out. 

I am, yours faithfully,



<person>C.HACION BOND</person>.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



SIR,—What has become of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>to which I have paid a subscription for two or three past years. We in the country look anxiously in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for some signs of its existence, but month after month goes by and we begin to think it is dead. Surely for an Association of such importance to the Province, we, the members, might expect to hear something between the annual meetings, but now we never even see any reports of board or Council meetings, which used occasionally to appear. We have been waiting now for nearly two years to see the results of <person>Mr. Townsend</person>'s investigations and experiments on the building stones of the Province, which <person>Mr. Curry </person>recently stated was of decided value to architects, and naturally we should like to know whether any progress is being made towards the erasion of the word "Registered" from the Act. .1 see in a speech of Mr. Curry's at the meeting of the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association</assoc> that the work of the Ontario Association has apparently dwindled to the training of students, and that he expects we. should all pay for this laudable object, and he infers that he does not want men to be in the Association who are not willing to do this without expecting to receive benefits I think we all joined the Association under the notion that it was to be for some rather more general good to the profession than that, and personally I do not see the advantage of remaining a member for the sole purpose of educating young fellows in Toronto.

The Quebec Association has hit upon an excellent idea, that of monthly meetings of the members in town. Now, if the city members would meet monthly, read and discuss papers and have the papers and discussions published for the use of country members, we should certainly be benefitted. It seems to me that the policy of our Council is to keep quiet—why. I do not know, unless it is that they fear to excite opposition, but I would remind them that opposition is generally very beneficial and in this case would certainly rouse us to do something for the Association in the way of helping against contrary influences, whereas now we are gradually losing all interest.

Now that the Association has shown its that some communication between the architects of the Province is a good thing, I for one would certainly like this communication to be kept up, and if the Association cannot do it except fi)r two days or so in each year, there is certainly room for some other organization, at any rate for the use of country members.

Mr. Curry says that the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Guild </assoc>dine together once a month or so and discuss matters of professional interest. He says that the Guild is very exclusive, by which I conclude he means that it is composed of probably the members of the Council who happen to live in Toronto and other members of the profession who have large practices. Now, most of these, if not all, must be members of the O. A. A. , then why, if they can meet and talk together as a Guild, can they not do so as the Association and let us outsiders have the benefit of their discussions? I would gladly subscribe that they may dine together if they would only do this for me in return

I do not wish to put myself forward as the mouth-piece of country members, but I feel sure they must all feel pretty much as I do, and it would be a good thing for us all if others would write to you their feelings in the matter.

I suppose there is to be a convention next February, and I have no doubt that the city members will do their best to make the country members welcome, and I do not forget how well they have entertained us, but pleasure ,apart from the meetings of the convention, will do us from the country very little real good. I understand now since Mr. Curry's visit to Montreal that we ate very selfish to expect any good ; we ought to come up in flocks or droves to benefit the students, but unhappily I cannot afford to do that, and I am afraid I must confess to being one who puts his "personal business" before the training of the youths.

Apologizing for the length of my letter, I am yours truly,

A COUNTRY MEMBER.
