DEAR SIR, I congratulate you on the expedition shown by your staff in turning out so rapidly your February number, notwithstanding the large mass of extra matter; and as stenographer of the Convention, I am delighted with the accuracy with which your compositors have done their work. However, as architects are noted for accuracy in detail, it is due to them that you allow me to correct two small errors. One is the insertion on page 17 line 6, of the name of Mr. <person>Gambier-Bousfield </person>as speaker. Remarks attributed to him should form a continuation of <person>Mr. Gouinlock</person>. The other error is a very slight one on page 21. In the middle of my remarks, the word Burning would no doubt puzzle your readers, who know no one of that name. The word should be Bunn-y. This is a case of the compositor "taking the Hun, and thus spoiling the pun.

Fraternally,

THOS. BENGOUGH.

DEAR SIR,---ln one of the works of Gwilt's " Rudiments of Architecture" there is a paragraph on page 120 which says

<firm>Palladio and Vignola </firm>the restorers of genuine architecture, are the authors whose works will be consulted with greatest advantage by those who desire to make any advance in the science, and most particularly by those who wish to obtain further knowledge on the use and abuse of its detail." Would you kindly give me the names of their principal works in the next number of the C. A. & B. and oblige,

Yours truly,

<person>EUGENE PAYETTE</person>.

[Palladio's four books translated by- G. Leoni, 1726, or I Ware, 1738, (both folios) will probably give our correspondent all be requires. They are, however, expensive. Both authors have produced valuable works on the "Five Orders of Architecture, a translation of one of Vignola's being called "The Regular Architect, or the General Rule of the Five Orders of Architecture," 1669. But most of these books are rare.—ED. C. A. &

<article title="competitions" author="">COMPETITIONS.

QUEBEC, March 12th, 1891,

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



DEAR SIR,-—-In the February number of your journal you published the following answers to certain questions from a Quebec correspondent "The name of the author of a competition design should not be attached to his drawings, and when so attached, said drawing should be ruled out as being informal. It would manifestly be unfair to allow a signed drawing to remain in the competition and even more unjust to award to such a drawing a premium."

I am disposed to believe that in answering thus to your Quebec correspondent, you merely had a desire to express a personal opinion as to the way competitions ought to be carried out, and that in no way did you wish to impress upon your readers that there existed fixed and accepted rules for competition, and which were always followed.

With the majority of members of the profession I am of the opinion that it would be a good thing for us to have such rules, which would insure a uniform method of calling competitions and of judging them. But Mr. Editor, since there exists at present no such accepted and uniform rules, those calling a competition are quite free, it would seem, to draft anything they like or may think proper in the way of instructions to the competing architects. We cannot, therefore, and have not any fixed method to impose upon any' one in this matter.

Supposing, for example, (a thing which is quite possible and even probable according to me) that the queries of your Quebec cot-respondent apply to a real case, and that the instructions issue(l to the competitors do not justify the answers as given by you, what then? Is not such a thing possible? I maintain that it is, and moreover, that the judge or judges in a competition are to be guided in their duty solely by the instructions issued to the competitors so far as the admission or putting aside of plans is concerned, and on the points on which a decision is to be given. We know of a competition for a certain public work, unfinished yet, and which has involved the expenditure of several millions, where the instructions to the competitors made no mention about using a motto or signing their plans and the plans were all signed.

Now if similar instructions were issued in the case of your correspondent, and one of the competitors made use of a motto, does he thereby invalidate any or all other plans which may have been signed by their authors? If so, there would be risk sometimes of awarding first premium to the plan which least conformed to the needs contained in the instructions.

I've been a little long perhaps, but the question of competitions is an interesting and many sided one, on which there exists a number of different opinions among members of the profession, not only here in Canada but on the Continent also, as may be

seen by frequent correspondence and editorials in the professional journals from across the water.

I remain, yours truly,

AN ARCHITECT.



[The reply to our correspondent in February number was based on the supposition that the competitors were instructed to send in their designs under motto. If such was not the fact, the case is of course materially altered, and there would appear to be no reason to find fault because first place was given to a signed drawing. We have on several occasions outlined the rules which should govern competitions. The majority of the profession are probably in accord with them, as suggested in the above letter, and if they will abstain from entering competitions, the conditions of which their judgment cannot approve, they will greatly assist in bringing about the reforms which they profess to desire.—ED. C. A. & B.]





<article title="a difficult problem" author="Baillarge, C.">A DIFFICULT PROBLEM.

QUEBEC, Feb., 1891.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR, Encouraged by your kindly invitation to propound questions, the answers to which may be of scientific interest, and reminded by the locomotive boiler explosion, an engraving of which appeals in the last number of the Scientific American, that I am still without an answer to a question I propounded at the time in relation to a similar occurrence in Quebec some years ago, I now beg to renew the query.

From what height must a portion of boiler plate (one quarter inch thick, some fifteen feet in area, and therefore weighing about 150 lbs.), torn from an exploded stationary steam boiler and launched into the air, have fallen to have been found by me standing upright in a log of white pine timber twenty-four inches square, into which it had penetrated to a depth of fourteen inches, almost exactly at right angles to the grain of the log.

The base of the parabola described by the missile dirl not exceed 100 feet. The ragged piece of plate had been blown out almost to a plane by the force of the explosion, and must have descanted in an almost vertical direction, as that in which it would meet with the least resistance from the retarding atmosphere, or in a plane parallel to the falling leg of the parabola, whatever its position may have been in the ascending branch of the course.

If it be considered that a good man with all his might could hardly drive the sharp edge of an axe into a stick of timber, across the grain, to more than half an inch, it will be admitted that the blunt-edged piece of plate alluded to must have descended from an immense height, thus to imbed itself to such a depth as fourteen inches in a log of two feet in breadth.

This occurrence took place at Archer's steam mills at Sillery Cove, some five miles from the city, killing the engineer in charge ; and it was on the occasion of my appearing before the coroner's jury that I visited the premises immediately after the accident.

<person>C. BAILLAIRGE</person>,

City' Engineer, Quebec.



[It would be almost impossible to calculate the force necessary to make such a cut without making some experiments in order to form a sound basis for the calculation. However, some idea of the force may be formed in another way. We may assume that when the boiler exploded there was not less than eighty lbs. pressure shown on the steam gauge. The sudden rupture of the boiler would permit its contents to escape into the atmosphere. Experiments in the flow of steam have shown that steam at eighty lbs. pressure will flow into the atmosphere through a safety valve at a i-ate equal to a velocity of 1,456 feet per second. This being the case, it is not unlikely' that the piece of boiler plate started on its upward flight with an initial velocity not less than 1,000 feet per second. Leaving out of account the resistance of the air, a body projected vertically into the air at such a velocity would go up three miles before it stopped and began to fall. Again deducting the one-third for friction of the air while descending, the plate would strike the log with a velocity of nearly feet per second. This velocity of a body of 150 pounds weight would be approximately represented by a pressure of 700,000 pounds on the surface of the log. The surface struck by the plate would be twenty--four inches by one-quarter inch, making six square inches, and the force of the blow would therefore have been about 116,600 lbs. per square inch, and we need not wonder that the log was cut to a depth of fourteen inches before all the energy was expended—EDITOR C. A. & B.]
