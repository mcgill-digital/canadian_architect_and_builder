question presents itself: who will assume this responsibility? Is the city prepared to be responsible for accidents which may occur in connection with scaffolds which shall have passed examination at the hands of the inspector? If so, to avoid the possibility of having to pay heavy damages the city must make the inspection thorough. and to do this will cost a larger amount of money probably than the citizens will consent to pay for the service.



OUR subscribers who may have chanced to see a copy of the Toronto Mail of January 1St of this year, were

undoubtedly very much astonished at the sixth page, devoted almost entirely to cards of Toronto architects—cards occupying a space of at least twenty lines, with the names of the firms in extravagantly large type. Anything more unprofessional could hardly have been desired, and it was difficult to understand how it was that the names of a majority of the members of the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Guild </assoc>thus appeared, when it is well known that this professional body sets its face against advertising, and especially against that form of advertising known as "puffing." We are glad then, to find that neither the Guild nor the Mail are entirely responsible for it, that, in fact, It was the result of a misunderstanding between the architects and the newspaper canvassers, They then went round among the architects and endeavored to persuade them to give them their cards for publication, at a cost of $10, for a "holiday number" of the Mail, with a "special circulation." They met with rebuffs from all architects who know the true character of their profession, and seeing that they were likely to lose commissions as far as architects were concerned, they invented a story that they had laid their scheme before the Secretary of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>and "it was with his approval that they ventured again to call." Without going further into the matter, some few men then gave up their cards and signed a form agreeing to pay the fee. In the meantime, the Secretary of the Guild had prepared a paper, signed by many members, in which they agreed that they would pay the fees on condition that nothing more should appear than a simple card, without any "puffing," on the further condition that an article on city architecture written by one of themselves should also be published. The canvassers were made to sign another agreement to the effect that if there was any " puffing," or if an architect's name appeared in connection with any building be had carried out, he (the canvasser) should not collect his fee. It is needless to say how entirely be broke his agreement. There was no "holiday number" with "special circulation"; the article on city buildings was compressed in the smallest type ; names of architects appear in connection with their buildings ; some of the cards occupy no less than forty line spaces, and are decidedly "puffing," and therefore the canvassers will find difficulty in collecting their fees from the thoroughly disgusted gentlemen who have been so provokingly taken in. When will the proprietors of legitimate business enterprises learn to confine their advertising to legitimate publications and refuse absolutely to have any dealings with "fakirs"? Experience proclaims this to be the only wise course to pursue.

TORONTO, Jan., 1890.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



SIR,—In the November number of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, you made some remarks on the lack of good architectural draughtsmen in Canada, and the little interest shown by them in the profession. Now I think the chief cause of this is insufficient remuneration. If the Canadian architects were to pay their assistants at the same rates as those in the States and elsewhere, I think the standard would soon be raised, for this reason Draughtsmen, if they take any interest in the profession at all, necessarily require more pay than will barely keep them, for not only must they get together the nucleus of an expensive library, but also save sufficient money to enable them to do a little travelling before becoming architects, besides many other things not required by ordinary clerks. To obtain the necessary funds at present, draughtsmen get as many jobs as possible to do out of office hours, and this time, which should be spent in perfecting themselves in the profession, is utilized for money-making. Last year this was why a number of them were unable to attend the meetings of <assoc>the Draughtsmen's Association</assoc>. No doubt this caused its failure as much as anything, and three years ago when the Association was first organized, a large number of those applied to attend the first meeting were doubtful as to whether they would have time to go in for it on this account. Probably the architects will take this little matter Into consideration whilst the professional improvement spirit is

with them.	Yours truly,

DRAUGHTSMAN.

SIR,—I shall be glad if you will give your views in the next issue of your valuable paper as to the better construction for a fire-proof vault—two 8 inch walls with 2 inch air space between, or 12 inch wall outside and 2 inch air space with 4 inch wall inside, bonded say every 5 feet super. to outside wall.

Yours faithfully,
