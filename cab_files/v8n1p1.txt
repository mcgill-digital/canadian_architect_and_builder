VOLUME VIII.

To mark the commencement of a new year and the entry of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER on the eighth year of publication, the present number is presented in holiday attire, and exhibiting special features in the way of illustrations and letterpress which it is hoped will be regarded with favor. An effort has been made to compile a statistical review of building operations in Canada for the year which has just closed, and to indicate as far as can be done at this early date, the outlook for the building trades for the approaching season. While this first attempt has not resulted in as comprehensive a statement of the situation as we hope to be able to present in future years, it will, we trust, bear reading with a degree of interest and profit.



The year 1894 was undoubtedly the most inactive which the building trades in Canada have experienced during the last decade. The cause is known to have existed in the severe commercial depression through which this country and continent has been passing. It is now generally admitted that bottom has been reached, and that the tendency during the present year will be upwards.

The CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is grateful for the support accorded to it during the period of depression which is now drawing to a close, and hopes to merit a share of the increased prosperity which we believe to be in store in the near future for all connected with the building interests. Indulging this belief we are with more assurance able to wish every reader a happy and prosperous new year.



A RECENT conversation with the manager of one of our largest manufacturing companies, served to indicate to some extent the prospects for the heating trade the approaching season. "Our repair business last season was the heaviest we have ever experienced," he said, "the attempt was made to fix up all sorts of old heating apparatus to the extent necessary to make it do duty for another winter. This leads me to anticipate a brisk demand for new heating apparatus next season." There would seem to be good ground for this view of the situation, and we hope to see the anticipations of better times, not only in the heating trade, but in all other lines as well, in some measure realized before the close of the present year.



WE regret to learn that amongst those who suffered loss by the financial collapse in Newfoundland, are several Toronto contractors. After the great fire in St. Johns, several architects and twenty or more contractors went from Toronto to that city and found abundance of employment. Some of these contractors had completed their contracts and returned home before the financial crash came, but others were less fortunate, and have been caught in the storm There were only two banks in St. Johns, and when both of these collapsed, paper currency and securities were valueless. Gold became the only medium of exchange, and some of our Toronto friends who were well enough provided with paper money and securities, had not enough of the precious metal to pay their way back to their homes.
