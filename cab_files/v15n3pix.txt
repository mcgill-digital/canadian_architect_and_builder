The American project to erect an immense office building on the Strand in London is said to have been abandoned owing to the inability of the County Council to grant a lease for 999 years. The <firm>Pall Mall Gazette</firm> rejoices that the powers of the Council in this respect are limited, and in consequence what it terms a building of the "Early packing-case order of architecture developed by the sucking palladios of Chicago and sometimes known as the perpendicular Goth and Vandal style" will not disfigure one of modern Babylon's leading thorough fares.

There should be a clause in the building by-law of every city fixing the distance from the street curb beyond which new buildings could not be carried. On one of the principal residential streets of Toronto at prominent city official has had large additions put to the front of his residence, thereby causing the building to jut out many feet beyond the neighboring houses, the owners of which are in consequence deprived of the view up and down the street which they formally enjoyed. The value of their properties is also seriously impaired, but they apparently have no redress. If the city had an up-to-date building law the rights of property owners would be protected, and if violated as in this instance, means of redress would be afforded.

The eccentricities of elevators and persons in charge, came up for discussion the other day An English elevator or hoist as it is there called, was described as constantly returning to the first floor for every new passenger without first delivering at their destinations the passengers already aboard. Several elevators in

Toronto were mentioned for their snail-like quality, which also became a marked characteristic of the attendants. On the other hand there are elevators which move at speed which takes one's breath away. A story is told of a stammering passenger who getting on one of these lightning elevators desired to be put off at the fifth floor, but was landed at the twenty-ninth floor before he 

could deliver his instructions.
