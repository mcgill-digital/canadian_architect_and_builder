A large number of students have submitted designs in the competition for a public library building announced in our November issue. The merits of these designs will be considered by a committee appointed for the purpose by the O.A.A. and the Toronto Architectural Eighteen Club, whose criticisms and award we hope to publish in our February number.



We are only able in the present number to make brief mention of the annual convention of the

O.A.A.	held in Toronto on the 12th and 13th Inst. Next month we hope to publish a more extended account of the proceedings, which were of a very interesting and instructive character. The excellence of the papers may be judged by the one by Prof. <person>R. C. Carpenter</person>, printed in this number. The address of the President, Mr. <person>W. L. Symons</person>, while comprehensive in its scope, dealt at most length with means whereby friction between employers and employees in the building trades might be lessened and strikes avoided. The suggestion was again made that the annual conventions should be held alternately in the leading cities of Ontario, The difficulty experienced in securing a large attendance even in Toronto offers little encouragement

to make trial of the idea, which if found feasible, would be likely to widen interest in the Association and its work. The exhibition of drawings and photographs contributed by architects in all parts of Canada added greatly to the interest of the occasion. In common with our readers we are indebted to Prof. Nobbs, of McGill University, for the notes on this exhibition appearing in another column. The proceedings terminated with an enjoyable dinner at the King Edward Hotel, at which several interesting addresses were delivered by Mr. <person>W. E. Doran</person>, of the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc>, Prof. Mayor, of Toronto University, Prof. Nobbs and others.



As a natural accompaniment to the rapid increase in wealth in Canada during the last decade

has come a larger expenditure on buildings for domestic use. This is particularly true as regards the interior decoration and furnishing of the house. In view of its growing importance the present number is specially devoted to decoration and furnishing. Our illustration pages show some interesting examples, while the specially written articles by well known authorities treating of various phases of the subject should add to the knowledge already possessed by our readers.
