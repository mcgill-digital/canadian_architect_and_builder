The following notes on 'Cement' are intended as a short synopsis of what others have said with an attempt to place them in a clear and concise manner capable of being understood by the student and not in any way as an addition to the already voluminous literature on this subject.

 CEMENTS.



As cement can he considered one of the most important building mat materials that an architect uses and furthermore one that is being used more extensively every day it is necessary that the strident of' architecture should understand in outline at all events the chief distinctive characteristics as well as the mode of manufacture of the various types in order that he may use them intelligently.

The basis of all limes and cements is Carbonate of Lime and in order that lime may contain hydraulic properties it is necessary that it be chemically combined with some form of Silica—usually' clay, which is a hydrated Silica of Alumina. It is largely the proportions in which those two materials are mixed that constitutes the type of cement to which it will belong. There are two heads under which cements are usually classified

r.	NATURAL CEMENTS.



2.	ARTIFICIAL CEMENTS 



Under the heading "Natural'' cements is usually included all so-called Roman cements as used in England, the hydraulic limes as found in France and Belgium, and the natural rock cements used so extensively in America.

Let us first take the industry in America

T. THE NATURAL. CEMENT INDUSTRY IN AMERICA.



Large deposits of Hydraulic Limestone, capable of producing good natural cements, are council in the United States, chiefly in New York, Maryland. Pennsylvania and Kent it Kentucky—and also in the Province of Ontario in Canada.

The natural cements produced from these limestone's differ from hydraulic lime in it they do not slake at all, their bulk and temperature remaining the same during both mixing and setting'. They also set \ very rapidly either tinder water or in the air. The most distinctive feature of these cements is the marked difference in the amount of magnesia they contain and they are on this account usually divided under the two headings

r. Lime Cements of those containing from 2 to 417734f magnesia.

2. Magnesium Cements or those containing from 12 to 3057216710f magnesia.

The larger part by far of the deposits worked come under' the latter category as the)' contain all the well known '' Rosendale'' brands. These magnesium cements set arid acquire strength rather more slowly that the lime cements but eventually equal them. They do not heat on mixing with water and do not with— stand most as well as tire lime cements when first mixed.

The lime cements gain their strength very rapidly but they have to be very carefully prepared as tire)' have a tendency' to heat if' too rich in lirrie and to blow if too strong' in silicates.

By the following tables it will be seen that the chemical coin— position of tire various brands found in different parts of the country varies considerably. Great care has to be used also in the satire quarry' as different strata produce varied results so that analyzing' has to be resorted to continually if the best results are expected.

The '' Rosendale'' cements, of' which there are several different brands, are the best known natural cements in America. They are the standard of tire magnesium variety and form nearly halt' of the total production of natural cement in America. The

Round Top'' is usually taken as the typical lime cement. The supply is somewhat limited and is therefore chiefly used in its own district, supplying Washington, Baltimore amid t he more southerly cities. The manufacture of these cement is similar with either variety. The hydraulic limestone is usually burned in a draw kiln which contains enough stone to make from 400 to 600 barrels. The stone and coal is laid in alt errata layers, and is usually drawn twice in twenty—four hours but this depends largely on the variety of stone It is carefully sorted, and all under—burned portions amid clinkers are then removed. In tire case of lime cement it is then either sprinkled with water or steamed, in order to slake any excess of lime. It then passes to the mill, where it goes through the pi process of being crushed and carefully ground, arid in the better cements screened.

The cement is there packed in barrels, which in the Eastern States contain 300 pounds, while in the West 265 pounds is the usual standard. In regard to fineness, which in late years has been receiving a good deal of attention, both from engineers arid manufacturers the best cements are expected to pass the follow— rug test

Although a large proportion of cements tested will no doubt be found to leave 20residue (at least) on a 200 mesh. As to strength and reported tests of natural cements one is as far from arriving at a certain goal as in Portland cement testing. There are so many' pinfalls one can stumble into in testing cement that one us apt to feel disheartened with the numerous tests showing almost any result one could wish. However, the following table prepared by Mr. Clarke for the Boston Main Drainage work from over 25,000 tests and made with great care to show time result of comparison between Natural and Portland cements will no doubt be of interest

These tests shrew the average of several brands and give a fair idea of tire proportional value of the t two varieties

The American Society of Civil Engineers gives the following table as approximate tests of the two cements natural and artificial

The above tables sinew that, as a rule taking equal quality in both natural and Portland, one part of natural cement and one of sand is equal in ultimate strength to one part of Portland cement to three parts of sand. Time natural cements set quicker, but do not at first attain so great strength.

The color of natural cements varies considerably from a light buff through a gray resembling Portland to a darkish brown as most Rosendales. This variation in shade is due to the proportion of oxide of iron contained ill the stone, and has inn no way any effect on the value of time cement although two barrels of tire SAME brand of different made would probably indicate that the lighter one was of unburned rock.

In regard to weight, tire American Society of Civil Engineers in their report on cement tests, say "Tire relation of the weight of cement to its tensile strength is an uncertain one In practical work, if used alone, it is of little value as a test; while in connec
