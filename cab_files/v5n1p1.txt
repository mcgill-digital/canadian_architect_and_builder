A FULL report of the proceedings of the second annual convention of the Ontario Association of Architects will be published in our next issue.



A GENTLEMAN from Toronto was a candidate at the recent examination for qualification as Associate of the <assoc>Royal Institute of British Architects</assoc>, and, we regret to observe, was not successful in passing.



A <building>PUBLIC library  Chicago</building>to cost a million dollars or more is to be erected in Chicago. It is said to be the intention to ask for competitive designs, and to give $1,000 each to the authors of the five best designs. If these are the conditions, the inducements are too small to attract the efforts of men whose knowledge of the requirements of such a building could be relied upon.



THE fire losses in the United States during the year which has just closed, amounted to $125,000,000, being nearly 50 per cent. in excess of the previous year. This, despite the fact that there were no great conflagrations. The Engineering News points out that the expenditure of the money which thus goes up in smoke would go far towards rendering the buildings more nearly fire proof.



IT was the intention to publish in this paper drawings and specification in connection with the second of <person>Mr. Hodson</person>'s series of articles on "How to Estimate." Some alterations in the drawings were thought necessary, however, in order that they might prove more instructive. This has made it necessary to defer their publication to the February issue. In this connection, if contractors see any way in which these articles might be made more serviceable, we shall be pleased if they will forward us their views on the subject. Any suggestion which may thus come to us will be carefully considered.



THE journeymen plasterers of Philadelphia refuse to work on the same building with graduates of the Plastering Department of the Master Builders' Trade School, of that city. The lads are desirous of completing their trade, and the master plasterers are anxious and willing to employ them. In pleasing contrast to the attitude thus assumed by the Philadelphia plasterers stands that of the <assoc>Bricklayers' Union </assoc>of Boston, which has arrived at the following understanding with the <assoc>Master Builders' Association </assoc>regarding trade schools "Trade schools are to be established and opened evenings. Instruction therein is to be given all regularly indentured apprentices. None but regular apprentices shall be allowed to enter these schools. Instruction shall be given to pupils in the theory and science of the trade they propose to learn."



The <building>Mansur-Tebbets warehouse in St Louis</building>, constructed on the slow burning principle, was almost entirely destroyed by fire recently. The result is said to have been due to lack of promptness on the part of the fire department and scarcity of water, rather than to defective construction. Although the contents of the building were of a combustible nature, the fire burned for a considerable time on the two lower floors before extending to the upper stories. Mr. <person>Edward Atkinson</person>, the advocate of slow burning construction, referring to the destruction of this building, says : "I do not think that we shall reach the true fire-proof construction until we attain a method by which the building is constructed wholly of fire-clay, or brick and tile, without any wooden or iron members in the structure:

similar to the method in which the new <building>Boston Public Library</building>
