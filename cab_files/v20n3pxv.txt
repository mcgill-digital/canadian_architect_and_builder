NOTES.

Messrs. Storey & Van Egmond, of Regina, were the successful architects in the recent competition for plans for a new

Y.	M. C. A. building for that city.

The City Council of Peterboro recently passed a by-law which compels all persons erecting buildings to first present thc plans to the authorities for their approval and obtain a building permit.



The Ottawa chapter of the Ontario Association of Architects are considering the advisability of laying a complaint before the City Council against the city plumbing inspector. They claim this official is allowed to draw up plans for plumbing in the city, inspect and pass the same. The objection raised is against the official being allowed to inspect his own work, while other plumbers have not this privilege.
