<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



suburbs, such as Westmount, St. Henri, Verdun, Notre Dame de Graces, Outremont, Maissoneuve, Delorimer, etc. The proof of this is in the St. Cunegoude, where we could not find to-day three building lots within the limits of that town proper. This state of affairs has existed for four or live years, with the result that as the last census shows that municipality has hardly increased in population tar the last decade.

What should be done at the earliest moment possible is the annexation to the city of Montreal of all those municipalities from Longue Point to Cote Saint Paul, which form an uninterrupted agglomeration of buildings and the whole of which is practically one city to us as well as the foreigner who sees no demarcation whatever between these several towns grouped in one of three hundred and forty thousand inhabitants.

The bulk of last year's work was certainly furnished by last winter's big fire in the business district. It is a great satisfaction to find that in most of the buildings rebuilt an effort has been made to render them less inflammable, the <building>Constine Building </building>for instance, immediately behind the ruins of the Board of Trade, being thoroughly fireproof. A Montrealer returning after a two years' absence would certainly not recognize old historic Saint Peter's street ; the two sides having been entirely transformed or rebuilt in the lower part.

Several important buildings were erected which deserve more than a passing glance, such as the new addition to the <building>Royal Insurance Company's building</building>, Place D'Armes Square, seven stories high and costing in the neighborhood of $175,000. In connection with this I am glad of this opportunity to give credit to the architects, <firm>Hutchison & Wood</firm>, for the respect they paid to the architecture of the past (an occurrence so seldom met with nowadays). The individuality of the old building has been preserved by continuing the new portion on exactly the same lines. In a few years the line of junction will disappear altogether by the change of color of the new stone and make the whole an imposing unity.

<firm>The Grand Trunk Railway </firm>offices on McGill street, by <person>R. A. Waite</person>, of Buffalo, N. Y., costing $500,000; <building>Carsley's new store </building>on St. James street, <person>by A. F. Dunlop</person>; <building>St. John Baptist church </building>and a $250,<building>000 R. C. structure</building> on Rachel street, by <person>J. F. Vauier </person>the <building>Merchants' Bank building</building>, additional stories, by <person>Edward Maxwell</person>; <building>the Wilson residence</building>, corner of Sherbrooke and Drummond streets, also by <person>R. A. Waite</person>; and the two princely residences on Drummond street, one in the style of an <building>English manor house, for Mr. R. Reford</building>, of the well-known steamship agency, and the other in the fashionable New York rococo style for Mr. <person>Chas.R. Hosmer</person>, of the <firm>C. P. R. Telegraph Co.</firm>., by the Messrs. <firm>Maxwell</firm>, are among the most important works of the year.

But, unquestionably, the building which has attracted the most interest, is the extension to <building>the Bank of Montreal</building>, now being built on Craig street, at a cost of nearly a million dollars. The structure, which is about 150 feet long, faces also on its long side on Fortification Lane, its axis being exactly in the center of the present building, extending from St. James street to Fortification Lane. As the slope of the ground is quite considerable from front to rear, (the ground floor on St. James street a few steps higher than the sidewalk), it will necessitate the construction of a bridge over Fortification Lane, uniting the two buildings, the

older of which will serve as a vestibule; and a monumental one it will be, with its magnificent facade, unrivalled by any other financial institution.

The slope is such that between the main floor level on St. James street and the level of the sidewalk on Craig street, two stories are gained, which will be devoted to public safety-vaults, the main floor being entirely reserved for the banking room, 40 feet high, with no windows, the light coming from the top. To give an idea of the richness of this structure it will suffice to say that no plastered walls will be in evidence, every inch of wall space being marble, and that the 32 columns of 34 feet in height, supporting the lantern, will each cost the sum of two thousand eight hundred and some odd dollars. The shaft will be in exotic marble and the capital in cast bronze, as in the antique pagan temple of old Rome.

This again is a lost opportunity for our architects, as it has been thought fit, as in the case of many of our prominent modern buildings, to call upon foreign architects to design the structure, Messrs. <firm>McKim, Mead & White</firm>, of NewYork, being in this instance the fortunate firm.

The erection of the <building>Foley apartment-houses</building>, on Dominion Square, Metcalfe and St. Catherine streets, by Messrs. <firm>Saxe & Archibald</firm>, acceuluates a new departure in our mode of living started by the <building>Sherbrooke apartment-house</building>. This structure, which is pleasing in appearance, will cost in the neighborhood of $400,000.

What this year may have in reserve is hard to foretell, but from present appearances, notwithstanding what real estate agents may say, we do not anticipate a season of great activity.

It is true, there are a few other mammoth structures to be commenced in the spring, such as the Liverpool, <building>London & Globe Insurance Co. building</building>, corner St. James and Place D'Armes Square. The building, which will comprise seven or eight stories, was thrown open to competition among a few city architects. Afterwards, it is reported, these architects were advised not to complete their designs, as the work had been given to the makers of the conditions of competition, Messrs. <firm>Peabody & Stearns</firm>, of Boston.

<building>The Birks Jewelry Store</building>, on Phillips Square, will be enlarged by a considerable addition, Messrs. <firm>Hutchison & Wood </firm>being the architects.

<firm>The Guardian Assurance Company </firm>has bought the remainder of the Barron Block ground, adjoining the <building>Lancashire Insurance Company's building </building>designed by <person>Edward Maxwell</person>, and will build an advertising structure, which, it is hoped, for the profession's sake, will not go out of a Montreal architect's office, in order to give the public an occasion once more to compare results with the American building to be commenced at the same date on Place D'Armes and St. James street.

<assoc>MONTREAL BUILDERS' EXCHANGE</assoc>



The Montreal Builders' Exchange have decided to adopt the system which has prevailed among American Exchanges, of renting desk room to supply firms and allow them to display samples of their materials in cases, the object being to make a permanent exhibit of building materials within the Exchange, and at the same time to increase the revenue.
