Our illustration of the structural steel-work is from the last photograph taken of the work. Since then the pitched beams of the roof have been for the most part erected and the frame is almost complete. We take the opportunity of repeating the perspective view, which was published in our November number but, by an unfortunate mistake, without the names of the associated architects.

These illustrations in the Architects' Edition show the construction of a wide avenue cut through the centre of Rio Janeiro by a commission which purchased a strip of land wide enough to include not only the avenue itself but the building sites on each side of it, and by the sale of these sites more than recovered the cost of the purchase of the property and the construction of the roadway.

<article title=" THE CITY PLAN " author="">THE CITY PLAN.



A year ago the Association in convention decided to forward the project of a comprehensive plan for the improvement of the City of Toronto. A committee was appointed with power to add to its number, and members of the Guild of Civic Art, the Toronto Architectural Eighteen Club and the Engineer's Club were invited to co-operate. The Guild of Civic Art kindly financed the scheme securing subscriptions from the citizens to defray the cost of an expert draughtsman, and the necessary printing and oilier expenses. Weekly meetings for discussion of the various projects were held during the Spring, Summer and Autumn. The result will be presented to you at to-morrow's meeting.

it remains now for the membership of the Association to assist by all possible means the launching of the project. Doubtless a long campaign of education of the public and the City authorities will have to he entered into, as large expenditures will be involved and some radical changes suggested. The plan has in view the future development of the City on comprehensive and right lines. Emphasis will need to be laid, however, on the fact that the cost can be distributed over very many years, that the changes need be but gradual, and that present expenditures can be confined to securing such properties as are necessary to this comprehensive development, and which if lost now to the City, ,may be forever lost.

It is suggested that the scheme, when adopted, can be best handled by a carefully selected Commission whose tenure of office shall be such as to permit of a consistent and continuous policy.

THE COMBINES.



An event which has created widespread interest and comment in the Province and particularly in Toronto has been the exposure of the combines, including those of the plumbers, plumbers supply men, and plumbers trades unions, which have caused such an undue advance in the cost of building.

Architects have been confronted for several years with this serious state of affairs, and the matter was frequently referred to in the meetings of the Toronto Chapter, but no one seemed lire-pared to offer a solution of the problem of how to obtain a healthy competition in tenders, and the consequent reduction of cost to a reasonable basis.

It is a source of satisfaction to have discovered, through the action of the officers of the law, that such doings are illegal and the perpetrators liable to prosecution. The building public may now take courage in opposing combines of this character instead of feeling hopelessly under their power.

It may be taken for granted that secret actions or combinations which result in undue enhancement of prices are probably illegal, also that the fact of secrecy suggests the possibility of injustice, which again suggests the possibility of secret and illicit combination.

We have learned that there is hereafter no more need of tamely submitting to such combinations, and that if again confronted with a like situation our clients should be at once advised to seek the advice of their solicitors.



<article title=" THE TARIFF ON PLANS " author="">THE TARIFF ON PLANS.



Advantage was taken of the presence of the Tariff Commission in Toronto last November to present a long standing grievanee of the profession, the admission, practically free of duty, of plans by foreign architects, for Canadian buildings.

As administered by the Customs department, the duty on plans has, for years, been merely nominal, being based on the cost of blue prints, as such; without any reference to the value of the services performed in the preparation of the designs or even the cost of draughting the original drawings.

The Government has thus lost many thousands of dollars of revenue during the past few years.

If we had reciprocity in architecture the matter would not be of such serious consequence, but when our plans are not permitted to enter the United States without paying a heavy duty and when our architects are not allowed to practice on tire other side of the line, it certainly becomes the duty of our Government to afford us the same protection which it affords to practically every other business or profession in the country.

Your representatives were very courteously received by the Commission and given a patient hearing.

Surprise was expressed by members of the Commission at the state of affairs and they stated that while the law as passed some years ago had not been changed, the rulings may have been altered resulting in the above anomaly.

The tariff on plans, according to the Statutes, is placed at 222675n the cost of the building erected. On a $100,000,00 building this would amount to $2,000. As lately administered a full set of blue prints could he brought in for probably $10.00 or about 20c. per sheet, it riot clandestinely introduced without any payment whatever.

The commissioners requested an expression of our views in writing with a suggested reasonable tariff. The following is a condensation of what was prepared and forwarded:— <article title=" SUGGESTED SCHEDULE OF DUTY ON PLANS " author="">SUGGESTED SCHEDULE OF DUTY ON PLANS.
