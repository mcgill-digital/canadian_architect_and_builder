OF late the fact has come to be recognized of the Results nized that great strikes of workmen,

of Strikes.



like that which took place a year or two ago in the engineering trades of Great Britain, are a serious blow to national commerce and prosperity. While British manufactories affected by this strike were closed down because of the unreasonable demands of employees, orders for goods which Great Britain was accustomed to supply were finding their way into the hands of manufacturers of the United States and other countries. Much of this trade has been permanently lost. A similar result followed the great strike of workmen in the Welsh slate quarries. The check on supply caused by this strike induced dealers to look abroad. As a result the value of shipments of slates from the United States to Great Britain has increased from $1,400 in 1893 to $900,000 in 1898. In such cases the workmen must share with the employers the loss resulting from a restricted market. Viewed from this standpoint, it would seem to he the duty of national governments to declare that strikes will in future be regarded as violations of law, and that differences arising between capital and labor must be decided by arbitration.
