VOL. VI.

To mark the commencement of the sixth year of publication, the January number of the CANADIAN A RCH ITECT AND BUILDER 1.1 will be of special character. A number of kind friends have consented to assist in its production, and a satisfactory result is looked for.



Besides features of special interest, this number will show a considerable increase in size, and in the number of illustrations, while the copies to be printed will largely exceed those of ordinary editions.

During 1893 every effort will be made to maintain the steady improvement which has marked the history of this journal in the past. We invite the kind assistance of every reader for this object while at the same time returning our thanks for favors past, and wishing each and all a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.



THE Council of the Ontario Association of architects have made several attempts to procure a suitable design for an Association Seal and have at last chosen the one which we illustrate in the present number. This design which was unsigned, as were all the others submitted, is the work of M r. Edmund Burke. The Council were greatly surprised when they discovered the author to be one of their number.



THE Registrar of the Ontario Association of Architects has sent cards to all the members requesting suggestions regarding matters of interest which should come up for consideration at the forthcoming convention in February. '[he members are also asked to contribute papers for the occasion. The Council is very anxious to introduce some new men and features into the next convention. and have to I rely upon the members both for their help and attendance to make the meetings a success.





A SERIOUS omission in the new scaffold by—law is the failure to regulate for the use of derricks. Not only ate the workmen in continual danger from the use of derricks, but the public also. Here was an opportunity to introduce into the by-laws of the city clauses by which all might be protected from the dangers of these great beams which stretch out far beyond the boardings that are supposed to protect the public. Several accidents occurred from the breaking of derricks during the past season, but we are apparently very slow to learn the lesson which such occurrences teach The lives of hundreds of foot

passengers are endangered by the raising of tons of material from the road by means of the heavy beam supposed to be substantially built and upheld, and swinging across thc sidewalks It is alarming to contemplate what might be the extent of the calamity if a rope gave way or the beam broke, and there is sufficient precedent to make us careful



THE cold weather compels attention to the heating apparatus, Now the landlord complains of the large amount of coal required at the boiler, while the tenants complain of the small amount of heat at the radiator. The best designed and most perfectly constructed apparatus will not heat the building unless it be attended to. Coal is put in the furnace to be burned, but when it is put on top of the bridge wall or on the dead plate just inside the furnace door its burning will not do much good The making of fire under a steam heating boiler requires experience and skill. The method of employing the man who will shovel the most coal ft)r the least money is a mistaken one. It gives satis.
