" author="">METHOD AND COST OF HEATING FROM

CENTRAL STATIONS.



Heating from central stations, as a subject in the question box of a recent meeting of the Iowa Electrical Association brought out some interesting information. The Brice Gas & Electrical Company, of Mason City, Ias which uses a hotwater heating system, wrote that it figures the amount of radiation required, according to the glass surface, wall surface and cubical contents, and makes a rate per season based on the amount of radiation required. If a consumer installs less radiation than the amount called for, he is compelled to pay for the full amount, which nearly always insures his installing it. If the radiation should be found insufficient, no extra charge is made for additional radiation installed, provided the normal temperature of the room does not exceed 70 degrees. H. C. Eddy, of the Chicago office of the American District Steam Company, contributed the following data: In a city in central Illinois the heating business is for public building exclusively, all on a meter basis of charge. The highest rate of condensation per 1,000 cubic feet of space per season last year was 10.779 pounds. The lowest was 1,650 pounds, and the average of all the customers served 5,328 pounds. A city in Nebraska heating public and business buildings gives the following figures: Highest rate, 7,475 pounds; lowest, 1,302; average of all customers served, 4,522 pounds. A city in Kansas finds the highest rate 13,709 pounds; lowest rate, 1,278 pounds; average of all customers served, 4,693 pounds. A city in Colorado: Highest rate, 24,666 pounds; lowest rate, 1,611 pounds; average of all customers served, 8,653. In a city in

Missouri the average results are: Residence, 9,400; public library, 5,800; theaters, 2,900; hotels, 5,410 churches, 2,840 ; stores and office buildings, 7,030 average of all meter customers, 5,503; average flat rate customers of the same general class of occupancy, 19,720. In a city in Pennsylvania for the first four months of this year one customer on a flat rate used 7,800 pounds of water per 1,000 cubic feet space. Another customer under the same conditions used 7,250 pounds, and a third customer under the same conditions but for three months instead of four, used 4,250 pounds. In the first instance, if the condensation used by the consumer had been paid for on basis of meter registration at the regular prevailing rates the cost for the four months would have been $1,065.42. That flat rate for the entire season was $1,200. In the second instance, if the condensation had been paid for at the regular prevailing rate, the cost would have been $848.16. The flat rate for the entire season was $720. In the third instance the three months on a meter basis would have cost $305.22, while the flat rate for the entire season was $300. in another case where the meter customers and flat rate customers represent practically an equal amount of space, it was determined that for the meter customers it required at the plant 712 pounds of coal per 1,000 cubic feet space heated per season and for the contract customers it required at the plant 3,280 pounds of coal per 1,000 cubic feet space heated per season.
