<doctype type="text;ad">THE C CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	ix.



The solicitor of the Toronto Public School Board has stated that it is illegal for the board to expend money for marking with tablets historical spots as requested by the Canadian Club.

The First Methodist church, which has recently been completed at Los Angeles, Cal., embodies in its construction a number of interesting features, one of which is a canvas ceiling. The idea of using this material for such a purpose suggested itself to John Austin, of the firm of Austin & Skilling, the architects who drew the plans and superintended the construction of the building. The ceiling rises in a great dome broken by ornamental trusses and is daintily frescoed in soft colors, presenting a very pleasing appearance. In executing the work No. 6 tenting canvas was used, it being painted on one side and sized on the other, the frescoing thus making it thoroughly water proof and air tight. There are many advantages claimed for a canvas ceiling, some of which are its lightness and cheapness, the absence of danger of cracking and of sections failing by reason of becoming loose through vibration.
