THE NEW <building>PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS OF ONTARIO</building>.

On the 4th of this month the new Parliament Buildings at Toronto were formally opened. It naturally occurs to us in chronicling the event, to consider what sort of bargain the people of Ontario got for their $1,200,000 odd.

The general scheme seems proper. The Legislative Chamber is in the center, over the main entrance and approached by the grand staircase. This gives the central motive which, from its singleness of purpose, lends itself to effective composition on the exterior. The offices of the Legislature and of the departments extend on each side of the center and along wings which return northward, finishing with a stack of lavatories at the end of each. That is the plan in simple, and it seems a straightforward plan in the usual manner of public buildings where a general scheme rules, and rooms are apt to be proportioned by position rather than use. But in the main feature of the interior arrangement there has been a judicious expenditure of space which makes the inside of the building fine, and is worthy of all praise. The grand corridor which runs the entire length of the building from east to west, is made of sufficient width to have on each side of the central portion (where the grand staircase landing intervenes) a space open from the ground floor to a skylight in the roof. The passages of the upper floors thus take the form of galleries at these points, and on the ground floor the corridor has on each side a colonnade which supports these galleries and their arcades. The colonnades, the open space, the light from above, all combine to redeem the corridor from the dark and dreary monotony that is so often all the architectural effect presented by the passages of a great public building.

Thus far we may perhaps assume the architect, but we are afraid it is too obvious that the person with whom we have had to deal for the carrying out of the plan is not so much the architect as the architect's draughtsman. We have no doubt the draughtsman did his best, we would impute to him nothing but righteousness, but surely the architect's commission was sufficient to afford a draughtsman who could design. In this same corridor which we have described, there is but one set of columns to be repeated along the whole colonnade. The detailing was limited, and with a little careful study in the hands of one who knew something might have been carried to perfection and made the whole corridor beautiful where now the details are poor on the ground floor and offensive in the upper storeys. On paper this essay of an apprentice in columnar details would be something to smile at, but that they should be actually erected in an important public building is a matter rather for indignation. The same may be said of the grand staircase. It starts fairly well in iron and slate, but above, where we get to the region of arcades, and what we may suppose to be intended for an ornamental ceiling, the draughtsman efforts should not have been allowed.

The Assembly Chamber, the grand piece of the design, shows more skill in the designer, but we are afraid cannot be said to satisfy good taste. There is some well executed wood carving on the floor of the house which really gives pleasure and is of the more value as being different in type from the style we have become accustomed to of late years.

Of the exterior we are afraid there is little good to be said beyond praise of the material. It is a fine mass of Credit Valley brown stone and as such cannot but look important.

It is not, however, of meanness we have to complain. The central pavilion with the main entrance, the 16 feet unmullioned windows of the Legislative Chamber above, and the enormous roof which crowns it, is certainly striking. But its proportions are swaggering rather than dignified. Perhaps its self-assertion may be intended to represent the idea of provincial antinomy, but we must confess we should have preferred to have complimented the idea by representing it with a little more of the dignity of beauty.

The roof of this central pavilion is a fine and bold erection, but it seems to us a pity that it was not constructed of iron, so as to save at least the danger of fire originating within its own limits As it is, being a forest of timber above the highest cast of the hose, its existence is a menace to the public documents below and the public may perhaps some day wish it were away.

the other roofs, we must candidly say we wish they were away now especially the eccentric hipped roots with glass tops over the main building on each side of the center. They must

form capacious snow traps at the junction with the other roofs. But our discontent is chiefly with the question of beauty of form, and with the draughtsman's apparent indecision as to what pitch to adopt. If thc buildings had been planned for a long ridge instead of these pyramidal forms with glass apexes, the front would have been much helped, and the glass might have shown only on the rear—the long suffering but picturesque rear.

But the glass is a friend giving the top lighted corridors within, and we should have been glad to see more of it if the architect had availed himself of it to a greater extent so as to reduce the size of the windows on the facades.

It is these which really spoil the building. They have not even practical advantage to recommend them. The corridors are lighted chiefly from the top, and could be given more light from that quarter and from the rear. For the offices themselves, windows of such a size are a great discomfort. The mere operation of lifting a sheet of glass 9 feet wide is found to be troublesome. In winter the rooms must be pervaded by the sun to a painful extent, and in summer also it will probably be necessary to keep the blinds down and exclude air as well as sun. With windows on a more reasonable scale there is more chance of compact and well arranged planning of the offices, as there is greater freedom offered for the disposition of partitions. The draughtsman too, with more reasonable windows, might have suffered less defeat on the exterior. As it is he has been unable to make anything of it. The conditions were hard, and he does not seem to have been skillful. Where he erred he erred no doubt from ignorance ; but this same ignorance, how much has it cost us ? Draughtsman is writ large all over our greatest and most costly public building.

Mr. <person>Coste</person>, Chief Engineer of Public Works, advocates the use of creosote for timber used in crib work and piling. It no doubt is a great preventive of the sea worm eating away the timber. As all the specifications for Government works of this class provide for all piling and crib work to be creosoted, there should be an opening for an enterprise along this line in Canada.
