mix of cement and stone a definite amount is taken from each of these bins, the quantity depending upon the purpose for which the stone is intended to serve and governed by certain rules determined by continued and careful experiment to obtain the best results. This grading of the crushed stone is, beside the careful selection of the cement, one of the most important factors in the manufacture of stone. It has long been recognized that great care should be taken in this particular. Many concrete and cement stones are made by merely mixing a little sand and gravel or crushed stone with cement in certain proportions, no attention being paid to the size of the grains of the sand or gravel. Such work combined with lack of knowledge in selecting and

handling cement has caused cement products to be regarded with undue suspicion.

After the cement and stone have been thoroughly mixed dry in a mechanical concrete mixer the water is added, not by the usual method in mixing concrete, but water which is kept at a constant temperature and the quantity automatically measured. In this way absolutely uniform results are obtained.

The ingredients are then thoroughly mixed wet for five minutes and run off into the agitator or ladle. This agitator is a large tub or barrel fitted with spiral paddles which are continuously revolved to keep the mix uniform. The agitator is carried about the foundry by a travelling crane of which the plant has three all

equipped with two ton triplex hoist. The cement mixture is poured into the moulds through a funnel and T pipe to keep it from cutting through the sand moulds. After the casts are made the stone is allowed to remain in the sand from three to four days when it is removed to the storage shed and carefully finished, all necessary precautions being taken to insure perfect results.

While the proper munipulation of the cement and careful observance of certain laws are necessary for producing the best product, yet by far the most important factor in manufacture is the selection of the proper cement. While nearly all architects and engineers realize the importance of proper testing, yet it does not seem to be universally known that a cement may satisfy one or several conditions yet fail in the special use for which it is intended; thus cement has been selected for use in making stone that stands the highest test and was universally recommended by professional men experienced in the handling of cement, yet imperfections have resulted that caused distrust on the part of the user and no end of annoyance to the manufacturer. It does not follow that any cement will give satisfaction for the manufacture of stone. However cement casts for building purposes have been manufactured in Europe for years and we find that these difficulties in manufacture have, by the aid and research due in a large part to the Association of Portland cement manufacturers, been successully overcome, where satisfaction is guaranteed and the industry can safely be said to have passed the experimental stage and stone is produced which in many ways excels the natural product.

The crushing strength of Roman Stone at the age of 6 months has been found to be from 2000 lbs. to 4000 lbs. per square inch depending upon the material used. All stone subject to tensile stress is carefully reinforced with steel. Stones as long as twenty feet have been made in one piece at the Roman Stone Company's plant and single piece columns are sold at a price little in excess of what the same would cost in wood.
