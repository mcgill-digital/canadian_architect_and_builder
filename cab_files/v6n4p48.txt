COMPETITION FOR <building>GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS AT VIC

TORIA</building>, B. C.

The experts in the above competition have given their decision in favor of the design submitted by Mr. <person>F. M. Rattenbury</person>, of Vancouver, The five sets of plans submitted in the final competition were thoroughly analyzed by the experts under the several heads of " Entrances," "Staircases and Passages" "Design and Composition," " Light, Air, Lavatories," " Construction," Detail," "Heating, Ventilation and Drainage "— the principal heads on which the award was based. As the result of this analysis, thc designs were placed in the following order of merit

1—" For our Queen and Province," (F. M. Rattenbury, Vancouver, B.C.)

2—"" Spes Labor Levis,' (<person>T. C. Sorby</person>, Victoria, B.C).

3—" Caractacus," (<person>F. M. Garden</person>, Chicago).

—" A Red Seal," (<person>J. M. Corner</person>, Boston, and <person>W. P. Skilling</person>, Seattle).

5—" Dieu et Mon Droit," (<person>J. Francis Brown</person>, Toronto.)

The following particulars regarding Mr. Rattenbury's design, which is in the Classic

style, are given in the Victoria Colonist

The buildings are arranged in three groups— the center or principal building comprising six departments so arranged that, whilst each of the three wings will be a perfect and complete building that can be erected independently of the others, they will when completed form a monumental and impressive pile. The grand entrance in the center of the facade leads into a central octagon hail, terminating in a nobly proportioned dome. From this octagon hail on the ground floor the Minister of Education's department is approached on the left ; the Treasury on the right, and the Lands and Works department in front. On the first floor the same arrangement is repeated with the Provincial Secretary's department on the left, the Attorney-General's department on the right, and the legislative hall and offices in the center. Thus from this

one hail is ever)' department immediately approached, all confusion or perplexity being entirely obviated. And while each department thus forms part of one central scheme, it has nevertheless its own independent entrance, staircases, strong rooms and lavatories, rendering it a perfectly contained and independent block.

The grand entrance is a handsome enriched portal, approached by a grand flight of steps. Through this the visitor enters the dome, which ultimately may he enriched by sculpture, mosaics and decoration. A flood of light is shed down from the cupola at the apex. On special occasions the entrance can be reserved solely for the legislative hall, the departments on either side having their own special entrance as before described. The legislative hail is situated in the center of the block and has a corridor round it with a belt of rooms for thc use of the ministers and members, committee rooms, library, etc.

The hall itself is a spacious and beautiful room. On three sides an arcade is carried round, with galleries for the public, ladies and reporters obtained over the corridor.

On the third floor the Lieutenant-Governor has a suite of rooms in front, facing James Bay and approached by the elevators next the principal entrance.

An unique and ingenious method of protecting the building from fire is adopted. At the approach to the three departments on each floor from the central hall, a system of iron doors or bulkheads is arranged, so that in case a fire might occur it can be isolated to one wing and controlled, without there being any possibility of its spreading. The heating and ventilation are also carefully considered. This is the principal block. Two others, perfectly fireproof, one on each side, are arranged for the <building>Land Registry office </building>on the right, and the <building>Government Printing office</building>, on the left. The two detached buildings at either side stand somewhat in advance of the principal building—looking on the plan somewhat like the three sides of a square. These are connected to the main structure by a colonnade of columns, forming a covered approach from one to the other.

The winner of this competition is a young man under 30 years of age, who arrived in British Columbia from England about a year ago.

We hope to be able to publish at an early date a reproduction of the accepted design, and also of some of the other designs which were submitted.

TREATING STONES FOR

CONSTRUCTION.

ARCHITECTS have lately called attention to the desirability, in thc case of stone that is to be used for important purposes, that it be quarried, stored and seasoned for some time before being hewn and p]aced in the walls, the natural sap being by this means allowed to evaporate and the stone tested as to its quality it is admitted that this method would add to the cost, but that the money would be well spent, if this precaution prevented the wasting of such stones by rains, frost or atmospheric influences, which, especially in cities, soon act on the surface of a newly quarried stone. On

the other hand, stone that is quarried one day and built in the next is in a green state, and must be considered unfit for use that it, it is not in condition—it is at its weakest—its pores are open and ready to absorb not only moisture but the gaseous and disfiguring influences which tend to its destruction. It is well known to every hewer that to get a polished surface on a stone that has lain for some time is very different from what is obtained on one fresh from the quarry—a fact which of itself is regarded as sufficient evidence to warrant the course recommended, namely, to thoroughly season the stone before using.—Builder and Woodworker.
