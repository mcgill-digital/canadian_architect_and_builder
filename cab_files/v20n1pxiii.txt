RECONSTRUCTED LIMESTONE.

The invention of a process which converts the waste debris of any good limestone into blocks of stone possessing greater strength and density than the natural stone, and which effects this without changing the chemical composition of the stone, is one of the most recent achievements in the domain of applied science.

The process consists in heating a portion of the waste limestone to the temperature at which it is decomposed into quicklime and gaseous carbon dioxide, and converting the latter into liquid carbon dioxide, The lime is then mixed with a certain proportion of the ground 1 mestone which has not been heated. The mixture is then slaked, and subsequently pressed into slabs

or any other desired form. It is next placed in a hydraulic press, and then taken to a drying room to expel moisture, and finally it is treated in a cylinder with the carbon dioxide originally extracted from the limestone. Thus it regains its original chemical composition.

We should have expected to find, says tire Builder, that by this treatment some free lime remained in tire interior of the reconstructed stone, owing to the inability of the carbon dioxide to force its way into the compressed mass, but the analytical report of Mr. Gregory, a copy of which has been forwarded to us, shows that the proportion of carbonate of lime in the reconstructed stone is quite as large as in the natural

stone.
