<doctype type="text">January, 1892	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	3



but who is prepared to find fault and object to everything that is done, is not worthy of being called an architect.

The object of the Association is to advance the interests of architecture by educating its members to a knowledge of the work which as architects they are called upon to perform. By architects studying each other's work and exchanging ideas, the profession will attain to a higher standard of general proficiency which will raise its members from among the careless, ignorant, or for-gain-only architects of the present day.

The architect who follows his profession simply as a means of livelihood will see no benefit in any Association if it does not increase his income. Personal gain is his only object, and to obtain it he is prepared to erect any manner or description of building, from the most dangerous to life to the most inartistic conception that man can be guilty of designing.

The object of the Association is not to determine a tariff of fees and insist on its members maintaining them, but to work earnestly to raise the members to a higher standard of architectural knowledge, so that they may be enabled to demand and obtain just and reasonable remuneration through the fact that their services are absolutely necessary to the successful erection of every important building, if it is to serve the purpose for which it is being erected.

There are some who think that the architect who has a large practice is more interested in the success of the Association than the average member. This is far from true, for the man with a good practice is independent of any Association, and the more inferior in ability his opponents remain the

- better it is for him. It is the average man and the young architect who will benefit through the success of the Association and the general advancement of the profession.

Do not let any man think that he is unable to assist in the work of the convention. Every one can do something, and out of love to his profession let each member do all that lies in his power. 

<article title="Presbyterian Church Competition" author="">PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH COMPETITION.

WE write to draw the attention of our readers to this competition. The Presbyterian Church recognizes that the architecture of its churches is not creditable, and desires to bring about an improvement. The method decided upon is to issue a pamphlet with short essays upon architecture, to instruct the congregations as to what is good church architecture. To do this, thoroughly good designs are absolutely necessary for illustration, and such can only be obtained from architects.

The church can not afford to pay for designs for publication in the pamphlet in the usual way, so it was decided to ask the assistance of the architects. This assistance is now asked, and it is hoped a hearty response will be made by the architectural profession. The profession is interested in this movement, and should give it reasonable assistance and support.

There are many architects who are not any too busy at present, who should be able to send in good and suitable designs. Some may say that they will not do so because they will not receive any recompense. Well, such is a fact, but have they not in very many instances to the injury of the profession persisted in preparing designs and forcing them upon prospective clients when they were not asked to do so in the hope of being able to obtain a commission? Now in this instance, the preparing of a design may lead to a commission, possibly to many commissions, and there is nothing small nor lowering in the transaction, but the opposite, as the Presbyterian Church will be assisted in their effort to improve the church architecture of this country, and the competitor will have the pleasure of feeling that he did what he could

There are many young men, and for that matter draughtsmen in offices, who could enter this competition with advantage to themselves and very probably with advantage to the object of the competition. Young men should seize this opportunity to find out just how they stand in comparison with their confrerés.

We strongly urge upon all architects and draughtsmen to render every assistance that may lie in their power to make this effort on the part of the Presbyterian Church a success.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)

THE hardware manufacturers and dealers of this city have started the circulation of a petition to the Government asking that a uniform appraisement of articles charged duty under the same clauses of the tariff at various ports of entry throughout the Dominion be arranged. The complaint is made that much inconsistency is shown by appraisers, and that in consequence of imperfect knowledge on the part of appraisers, imports at small ports enter at lower rates than in the cities.

BOARD OF TRADE BUILDING

The sum of $200,000 has been subscribed towards the erection of the <building>Board of Trade building Montreal</building>. This is less than half the amount required, and judging by the difficulty experienced in obtaining it, considerable effort will he required to secure the balance. In a wealthy commercial centre like Montreal, money should he freely forthcoming for an enterprise of this kind. The methods of the Building Committee resembling so closely those of the Toronto Board of Trade, it may be that like results are expected to follow, which may possibly account in some measure for the tardiness with which the subscriptions have conic in.

<article title="Sanitary House Drain" author="">">SANITARY HOUSE DRAINS.

IN dealing with the question as to the proper size of drainage pipes for houses, Col. <person>George E. Waring </person>expresses a decided preference for soil pipes of small bore, his own dwelling being furnished with a soil iron pipe from above the roof to outside the building line, of three-inch diameter, this being connected with the street or main sewer by a three-inch earthen sewer from the building line; there is a fall of nearly half an inch to the foot, the distance outside from the house to the main sewer being 110 feet; on this three-inch line, with its two water closets, bath tub and kitchen sink, there have been during ten years' use not more than five or six obstructions, mainly due to the presence of the running trap on the main drain. In proving to his own satisfaction the inability of a three-inch soil pipe and house drain to carry off the sewage and waste matter of a private dwelling of average size, Colonel Waring does not recommend the use of three-inch pipe, but considers that a four-inch soil and drain pipe is sufficient for all dwelling houses, a four-inch being able to carry nearly 8o per cent. more than a three-inch pipe. In the same manner he declares in favor of a six-inch pipe for street sewers, though circumstances may exist where a larger pipe should be used,
