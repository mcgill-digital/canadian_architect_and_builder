<doctype type="text">THE	CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



is what has been done in the past. The specimens of the work hanging on the walls show sufficiently what we are doing now.

The removal of our classes from premises which had become too small, to this splendid building, calls upon us to do much more than has been done in thc past. New requirements demand our attention. To our classes in freehand, mechanical and architectural drawing, we will soon have to add classes of mechanical application. Pupils must be taught to apply to material substances the principles they have learned to put down on paper. Workshops with forges and turning lathes have become indispensable. Carriage-making, joiner-work, brick-making and laying, stone-cutting, making wooden patterns for iron and brass foundries, filing and polishing iron and wood, arc so many things which want of means has hitherto prevented us from taking up. It is for you, gentlemen, who by your social position, are more especially charged with the duty of watching over the welfare of your fellow-citizens, to reflect upon the material and moral advantages that would flow from such a teaching.

And what have we done for the working-women. We frequently receive petitions asking us to do something for them. In our large towns there are those who are only waiting for the opportunity to acquire instruction in the various occupations which are suited to them. If we do not hasten to do something, the time is not far distant when they will work at many things which are now reserved for men. Most offices now employ women as stenographers, typewriters and assistant accountants. To my mind such a state of things is subversive of social order and can be productive of no good. Without doubt, women, at well as men, are subject to the law of labor, but we must carefully avoid whatever may contribute to lower woman's influence in the family. Let us give her cooking schools, where she can learn cooking, and study those industries which are specially suited to her sex—easier for her. Let them study needlework and crochet, which, with the aid of the study of drawing, might be made much more remunerative than any work they now do in shops, offices and factories. By developing the kind of instruction suited to working men and working women, we will escape those anomalies which threaten to subvert our social condition, to the detriment of the family, which is the basis of every well regulated society.

"Such, ladies and gentlemen, is a programme which is only slightly outlined, but which calls more and more for the attention of every citizen who wishes to promote the welfare of his fellow-citizens and of his country. In the first place, we must have those schools of application, of which I have just spoken, in which the great principles of mechanics would he applied, in which the future foremen of our large workshops would he trained, instead of our having to go abroad for them. I believe that before long our means will allow us to develop that portion of our programme. The installation of these workshops in schools are expensive, hut fortunately there exists an establishment in Montreal with ample plant, which could be completed at a comparatively slight cost. I mean the institution founded by the executors of the late <person>F. X. Beaudry </person>at the corner of St. Catherine and St. Urbain streets. Circumstances have not permitted these executors to give it the development which the testator had in view, but I have reason to believe that before long it will he again devoted to its object—the instruction of young workmen in the mechanical and industrial arts, and that an understanding will he arrived at between the Council and the administrators of that estate for the use of these workshops.

"We have everything needful for training our young men for the liberal professions; we now have excellent commercial colleges, where those who wish to adopt business pursuits find everything necessary to prepare them for that important career ; but what have we for preparing those who are destined to industrial arts ? Nothing, or almost nothing, and yet, gentlemen, the constant transformations of industry call continually for educated workmen to allow us to ·maintain an honorable position in this vast country. We must do here what is done in England, France and Germany the municipalities must assist the Government. There are towns in England of from 3,000 to 4,000 souls, which allow these schools from $25,000 to $50,000 a year. How could the corporation of the city of Montreal more profitably employ a sum equal to our subsidy from the Government—$10,000 a year? With such an additional amount, the number of our pupils would soon reach 1,000 to 1,200. Montreal would become the great center of industrial teaching for the whole country.

The citizens who are always interested in seeing that their money is judiciously expended, should take an interest in the development of these studies to which they have hitherto been so indifferent. These, ladies and gentlemen, are the suggestions which I have thought proper to make on this occasion, where we have representatives of all classes of society assembled together. May these suggestions bear the fruit which I hope from them."

Then came speeches from Hon. <person>judge Jette </person>and Hon. <person>J. Royal, </person>followed by a lecture on "Practical Education" by Mr. <person>J. W. Hughes</person>, which we regret, owing to pressure of space in this number, we are unable to publish.

The distribution of prizes, amounting to $145 in value, followed the speeches. The prizes were distributed in cash to the most deserving pupils of the different classes as follows

Prizes were also distributed to the Boot and Shoe Pattern Making Class, but are omitted, as they hardly interest our readers.

The exhibition of specimens of the pupils' work held from the 29th April to the 4th inst., on the occasion of the distribution of prizes, was located in the large Banqueting Hall of the Monument National, where each branch of the school established all through the Province, had a wall space and tables allotted to their exhibits. The first exhibit that met my eye as I entered was that of Levis, consisting mainly of mechanical drawings. These were accompanied by freehand drawings rendered in crayon, one of which, a floral study by Mr. Geo. Buck-hand, is worthy of special mention. Mr. <person>J. Turgeon </person>exhibited a good drawing of the figure of a woman, as did also Mr. <person>S. R. Page</person>. If Quebec did not possess an extensive exhibit, it was nevertheless well represented by Mr. <person>J. A. Gosselin </person>with his drawing of a head of a child, and by Mr. <person>A. Turcotte </person>with his drawing of a typical old "habitant " of the French province, rendered in lead pencil, which, while not possessing all the brilliancy of the crayon, is none the less more pleasing.

Montreal, as it might he supposed, had the most extensive exhibit the advanced class of Freehand Drawing, the Modeling class, the Plumbing class, the Lithography class, all making a very good showing, but unfortunately half of the balance might as well have been left out altogether. The evident cause of the failure of the Architectural class is no doubt to he attributed to the fact that this class is mainly frequented by apprentices connected with the building trades, and who have had but one season's practice. The architectural student, having enough geometrical drawing practice during office hours, prefers to follow the course of the Modeling class or the Freehand Drawing class, where he is likely to derive more advantages. Mr. Charles Mitchell, a young architectural student, the winner of the first prize, exhibited drawings showing considerable skill, and his drawings in fact were the only exhibits of any interest in that section, one being a suburban residence in the colonial style rendered in water colors, and the other, two designs for school buildings, one of which was drawn in perspective in pen and ink.

In tile Advanced Freehand Drawing class Mr. S. Robertson was without comparison the leader, all his drawings being nude studies of figures drawn in a sketchy way, and exhibiting a considerable knowledge of anatomy. Most of the other drawings exhibited were drawn from plaster casts executed by the pupils of the Modeling class of the school. Messrs. <person>D. Coristine </person>and <person>H. Russell</person>, of the Plumbing Class, have done work that could well compare with that of many excellent and experienced plumbers. The Modeling exhibit, although consisting of few specimens, was one of the finest in the Exhibition, and Mr. <person>F. Sousy</person>work might fittingly find a place in the International Exhibition of Art.



Mr. <person>A. C. Hutchinson </person>is daily- expected to arrive home from his European tour.



I have been requested to state that <person>Mr. Mann</person>, the architect of the French Baptist church, commoner of Cadieux and St. Catharines streets, which has been condemned and ordered to be torn down, is not Mr. <person>Eric Mann</person>, the well-known architect of St. John street. The latter gentleman, unfortunately, owing to similarity of name, has been getting credit in many quarters for the failure which this building has turned out to be.
