The CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



 GENTLEMEN.— In acknowledgement of your favor of July 26th, regarding the matter of a Provincial Builders Exchange, most say I hat I am heartily in accord with the formation of such an association, and hope through the medium of your publication that you will awake the contractors and builders of Ontario to the fact, that it is essential that a Provincial Builders Exchange he organized at the earliest opportunity. You may ask, "why is it necessary to have a Central Exchange when almost every City has a Local Exchange? In answer to that, I may say, that the Local Exchange may handle questions affecting the trade in the city or town where the are located. But there are problems, which affect the public, as well as the contractor, and these require the united efforts of all the exchanges consolidated in one Central Association. I believe that such a Provincial

Association, taking in all the Local Exchanges, is most essential to carry on a successful issue, as affecting the interest of the contractor, and the public in general. There are so many issues affected by organized trade unions, and the unfair methods used by organized labor to attain their aims, that the contractor must of necessity organize.

Then again, there are certain laws on the Statute Books of this Province which require amending, and if we had a Provincial Exchange, we could bring more influence to bear upon the Legislative Assembly, and have them so amended, that they could he of some benefit to the contractor. The leaders of organized labor always have some representative to look after their interests at all the sessions of the Provincial Assembly, and if they find it beneficial, why would it not pay the builders to have some one to represent them and look after their interests, which could he easily accomplished if we had a central association. There are also a great many other issues which would be a benefit to the contractor and builder, but I will leave them to older heads than mine to pronounce upon.

GEO. C. YOUNG,

President <assoc>London Builders' Exchange</assoc>.

Although United States cities have been complaining that the San Francisco disaster has caused a cement famine, Canadian cities and particularly Winnipeg, will not suffer. Throughout the States cement has gone up .35 cents a barrel and the expectation is that it will continue to rise in price. Winnipeg gets all her cement from Ontario, particularly from the vicinity of Owen Sound. Rather than an increase in prices there is a steady and appreciable diminution as new firms get into the field. The trade in cement has increased with am zing speed in Winnipeg in the past ten years. In 1896 500 barr Is supplied the demand in the entire northwest. Last year it took 125,000 barrels to satisfy Winnipeg alone. So long, say the dealers, as the marl lakes in the neighborhood of Owen Sound last there is little fear of a famine.
