WHILE the present number of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is being printed, the American Institute of Architects is meeting in annual convention at St. Louis, Mo.



The Royal Institute of British Architects has raised a fund and secured facilities for the thorough testing of bricks and brickwork. The work will shortly be entered upon.



THE recent mishap to the conduit pipe of the Toronto water-works should have tendency to popularize the electric elevator, resulting as it did in stopping the operation of every hydraulic elevator in the city.



A MONUMENT is to be erected in Quebec to the memory of Samuel de Champlain, whose name is so intimately connected with the early history of Canada. Artists, sculptors and architects are asked to send in plans, models or drawings up to Jan. 2nd, 1896. The cost is not to exceed $30,000.



"THE manufacturers make more nails every year than can be sold," a Montreal manufacturer gives as the justification for a pool which has just been formed by the nail men in Canada. Combines among nail rnanufacturers have been in existence in the United States for years, but this is the first time, so far as we know, that a united move to diminish the output and increase the price has been made in this country. How long will it last?



IF the amount of building in a city is an evidence of prosperity, and no doubt it is, Chicago must be enjoying a return of good times. During May, June, July and August permits were issued for the erection of 3495 buildings, with a frontage of over 17 miles. The cost will reach $20,000,000. In 1894 permits were issued for the same four months to the amount of $11,539,065 and in 1893 for $7,638,455. The Windy City seems to be growing.



A POINT of considerable interest to contractors in Toronto is said to be likely to come up for decision at an early date. At the solicitation of the Trades Unions of the city, the Toronto Public School Board recently placed a clause in its specifications  for work on public school buildings, providing that the contractor must pay his workmen the union rate of wages. On a recent contract, the contractor made an agreement with journeymen bricklayers to work at 30 cents per hour. It is reported that notwithstanding this agreement, these workmen propose to bring an action to compel the contractor to pay them at the rate of 36 cents per hour. Thirty-six cents was the rate which obtained under the recent agreement between the Bricklayers' Union and the Toronto Builders' Exchange. It will be remembered that this agreement lapsed on the 1st of May last, and the contractors contend that since its termination there has been no recognized scale of wages for journeymen bricklayers. This is the point upon which the decision is likely to turn should the matter be brought into the courts, and the outcome will be looked for with interest.
