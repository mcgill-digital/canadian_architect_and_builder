to represent summer rooms, at the exhibition of the Guild, at the Art Galleries in Phillips Square, in February next. The rooms are to be arranged specially for the advantageous display of the Canadian Home Industries in which the Guild is interested. The drawings are to be submitted on November 28th. The subject of the Junior competition is an outlook in Greek Ionic style.

On the 7th November, the subject of the programme was a debate "Has L'Art Nouveau had a beneficial influence on Architecture "? Most of the members present had a word to say on the subject, which was dealt with in a lively manner. No vote however was taken, as it was understood that several members were speaking rather as special pleaders than as convinced.

<article title=" SPONTANEOUS IGNITION OF WOODWORK " author="Lewis, Vivias B.">SPONTANEOUS IGNITION OF WOODWORK.*

Next to matches as a cause of accidental fire comes the fitting of woodwork by faults in flues or overheating in the vicinity of the fireplace. One would imagine that such a thing as building a beam into a chimney, or laying a joist close under the hearth of a fire-gate, would be so manifest a danger as to insure its never occurring, but such criminal carelessness is by no means so uncommon as one might imagine, and in such cases it is only a question of time and chance for a fire to be caused by it.

A beam, the end of which impinges on the interior of a flue, may be so far above the grate that for years no trouble arises, but the hot up current of gases in the chimney will gradually dry and carbonize the wood, whilst any collection of soot in the chimney catching fire will start a smoldering combustion in the beam that may go on for a considerable time before it gets sufficient air to cause it to break into active combustion.

A more usual source of danger is to be found in the perishing of the mortar used in building the flue, this leaving gaps in the brickwork behind which the wood work is situated. Mortar practically consists of a mixture of slaked lime and sharp sand, and when brickwork has been laid with this, the first hardening of the mortar is dependent upon the slaked lime absorbing carbon dioxide from air, which converts it into carbonate and causes it to harden, while after the lapse of many years a further action takes place by the silica of the sand acting on the calcium carbonate to from a silicate of great hardness and strength. With modern buildings, however, the first action is the only one that has taken place

The brickwork in the interior of a flue is often very roughly laid, being out of sight, and the bricks, instead of being laid true and nearly touching, are made up with broken bricks and a considerable quantity ot mortar. After this has set the action of heat upon it is again to burn the calcium carbonate back to lime, so causing the crumbling down of the mortar, and should a joist have been built-in close to the casing of the flue, hot gases will find their way through the perished mortar to it, and gradually bring about slight carbonization of the wood, and occasionally cause its ignition.

Another fruitful source of danger is to be found in the replacement of one form of grate or fireplace with a new one. For instance, a grate is getting rather old, you determine to have it replaced by one of modern construction, say one of the "well fires." In the old grate the hearthstone was flush with the floor, and under this was a sufficient mass of concrete or mortar amply to protect the joints below from undue heat, You probably buy a new grate from a local ironmonger and intrust him with the job of fixing it, and the old hearthstone and insulating material having been removed to make way for the entirely different structure, the inexperienced workman fasten properly to insulate the bottom of the well-grate, with the results that the joists below get overheated.

Dangers of these characters can only be got over by strict supervision during the building of a house, and by intrusting alterations and repairs only to workmen who thoroughly under stand the work which has to be done.

All heating dangers are largely increased, and indeed
