who have the courage or their own convictions sufficiently to legislate for the good of the country—they prefer to cater to the popular vote. If the plasterers keep on demanding higher wages, the effect will react upon themselves and capitalists will prefer not to build, o the architects will have to consider some substitute for plaster Another important question which arises is, who is responsible? The contractor says be s free from responsibility of fulfilling his contract in a specified time, owing to an unforeseen strike. If these is no recount against the strikers, and the builders are not responsible owing to the strike, then the only person who suffers is the proprietor This seems to me wrong, that a private individual who contracts with a builder for the erection of a house which be is either to occupy himself or has leased to another, is to be at a loss, or inconvenienced, because certain trades want to force the master builders into paying wages for work which Is not yet contracted for.

Certainly it seems to me that the person building least of all should be the one to suffer loss, and have no doubt in my own mind if a test comes before thc courts, the responsibility would fall on proper shoulders.

A correspondent writes to the American Engineer as follows:

"We are heating four greenhouses, each 75 x 21 feet, and one potting shed 50 x 20 feet, also one propagating house 50 feet long ; using the "over-head and return under-bed" system of piping. We use two 2½-inch steam flow pipes in each house overhead and seven 1-inch return pipes. The boiler is a No. 7 Furman brick-set, and it heats all our houses on from ¼ to

pound of steam. The entire heating arrangement works to a charm. The boiler, especially, extracts about all the heat from the coal whether run on a small or a brisk fire. It makes steam on a run, and the effect is instantly felt in the houses. We consider it a complete success and far superior to hot water, by which we warm some of our other houses.

ESSAY ON PLUMBING."

By "Lucius ORDO"



O

NE of the most important subjects to be dealt with in connection with modern house planning, is that which comes under the head of plumbing, that having probably more to do with the health and comfort of the inmates after the house is completed than anything else. The introduction of plumbing-work into a house is, broadly speaking, for two reasons, to bring in a good and sufficient supply of pure and wholesome water, and to afford adequate means for its disposal after use, together with human excreta and other waste matters, this refuse being generally comprehended in the term sewage.'

There can be no doubt that the simplest and most direct means possible are the best for accomplishing these objects, and in designing the plumbing system. simplicity and first principles should be continually kept in mind. In order to obtain a full inspection of the work at all times, and to prevent accumulation of filth in dark corners and consequent pollution of the atmosphere, all pipes, etc., should be fully exposed to view, and this, in fact, is the only sure way of securing first-class workmanship, for there are plumbers who, knowing their work will be covered up immediately on completion, care very little about the results if only they can get their job completed. Not so very long ago, a practical illustration of this came to notice, and that too in a house where all fixtures were exposed In the main part of the building, the work was so well done as to attract particular attention, the joints of both lead and iron pipes were everything that could be desired, and the bends of full bore throughout were so well done and symmetrically arranged, as to be an ornament rather than an eyesore to the rooms in which they were placed; but in peering about the cellar, a lead waste pipe was discovered, partly hidden by the ground floor joists, in which the bore at the two bends in it was decreased fully one third, thus forming a serious means of obstruction. This only shows that where there is the slightest chance of the work being hidden, it is apt to be negligently earned out The main pipes should be arranged so as to pass down in inferior rooms or closets, or else in chases specially prepared for them, the last mentioned way being least commendable, as in some cases it gives a pretext for care. less jointing. If objection is made to the pipes being exposed, they could be covered with wood paneling, but this should only be screwed together to allow of easy access to the pipes. All fittings should be as little encased from view as possible, in fact, only the barest requirements in the way of casing should be conceded to There is no earthly reason why every fitting should be shut out from sight as the custom has been for so long If the work is well done, it is far from being an eyesore, and in the better rooms and more public places. the fittings could either be made entirely of brass. or else nickel-plated, and if safes are deemed necessary, they can be of marble, although the necessity for safes when all the fixtures are exposed is not quite apparent, for a leakage could not remain unnoticed long enough to do any damage, and in this case a superfluous appendage of the plumbing system might be done away with. This principle will be found to work best all through, for the simpler and less complicated the whole thing is, not only will it be less liable to get out of order and require frequent attention, but the cheaper it will be in the first place Of course it is not to be understood that cheapness is to be of primary importance By no means Let enough money be spent to secure a thorough job. There must be no stint in that, but superfluities ought to be avoided The amount of cold metal which goes into a house now, bears an alarming proportion to the cost of the whole building and certainly economy in this respect ought to be regarded as much as possible

There can be no question that metal pipes only should be used inside a building. The unreliability of cement joints in earthenware piping, and the danger arising from the pipes themselves being so easily broken, ought to preclude their employment in that connection altogether The defects of other systems of house drains that have been made use of are so glaringly apparent, it IS not necessary to mention them On the whole, iron is more suitable for soil pipes than lead, at any rate in this country In England where the wastes from baths and basins are not emptied into the soil pipe, and where the pipe itself is always outside the house, no doubt lead pipe may be suitable, from the universal use of it in that country one would gather that it is, but in this climate it is necessary to have the soil pipe not only inside the house to prevent it being choked up by freezing, but if possible against an inside wall, and the superiority of iron in a case like this can at once be appreciated. It is not only lighter and stiffer, but less liable to injury, such as by nails being driven through it, etc. These are important points inside a house, and then, with all wastes running into it, a lead pipe would soon be deteriorated by the action of hot water from baths, etc Taking all this into consideration, with the fact that iron requires the least means of support, there is no hesitancy in claiming that it is the most suitable material It can be cast into almost any shape, and In fact, the patterns usually kept in stock will meet any ordinary requirements For the smaller branch wastes, etc , lead pipe, which is more easily manipulated, is generally used ; and for these purposes is doubtless the best.

As a rule, cast iron is used both for soil pipes and house drains, and no doubt is very efficient , but for the upright pipes, wrought iron with screw Joints which is now being extensively used is probably better for where there is apt to be any pulling strain, occasioned by settlement or otherwise, the lead joints of cast iron pipes soon give way, and allow sewer gas to permeate the house. Then again, the heavy bells have rather an ugly appearance when exposed to view, and take up a great deal of room. Wrought iron pipe is also made in much longer lengths than cast iron, thus necessitating fewer joints

When cast iron is used, it should be of extra heavy quality, and the hubs should be strong enough to allow a good caulked joint to be made, as these are the only joints ordinarily used which can be relied upon at all It should be straight and perfectly smooth inside, and to insure against all flaws and defects, should be thoroughly tested by hydraulic pressure before being coated by coal-tar, which is done to prevent corrosion As the efficiency of the pipe system depends largely on the joints, great care should be taken to see that these are all well executed

The pipes should be placed within one another in as straight a line as possible, and a gasket of oakum well rammed into the hub between the two pipes to prevent the lead from entering the joint and forming an obstruction Although some consider it better to pour in the molten lead in two separate
