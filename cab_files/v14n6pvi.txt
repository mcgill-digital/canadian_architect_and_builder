A Heater



WITHOUT A JOINT



Is what we offer you in







THE PRESTON HOT WATER BOILER

The advantages of this feature in its construction are self-evident. There can be no leaks on account of bad packing, nor is there any opportunity given for expansion or contraction to open up joints. The water chamber is made in ONE SOLID CASTING, and so designed as to give a VERTICAL CIRCULATION. By making use of this NATURAL LAW, we greatly increase the efficiency of the heater.
