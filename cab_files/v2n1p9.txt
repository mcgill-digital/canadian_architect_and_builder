THE 

CANADIAN 

ARCHITECT AND BUILDER

interior courts are lined, have been brought from the kilns belonging to the Hon. <person>W. L. Gladstone </person>at Hawarden, Wales.

It is to be expected that the present State House, whose gilded dome has been Boston's landmark for so many years, way have a rival soon. The state of Massachusetts has brought the property immediate1y in the rear of their present headquarters and a supplementary building will probably be erected, as soon as possible. The terms for an architectural competition are now being prepared1 and it is not likely that much time will be wasted, as the present building though dear to the hearts of all Bostonians, is generally admitted to fall far short of its requirements in many ways.

On State street, architects <firm>Peabody and Stearns</firm>, are putting up what will probably bc one of the finest office buildings in the city. The <building>Fiske building</building>, as it is called, occupies some 8o feet square of ground, and is ten stories high or 130 feet from sidewalk to roof, while the roof and the lantern which is to crown the building will bring the total height to about 218 feet Thc State street front is of granite, and, with thc exception of the main entrance which is a round arched, all the openings are square. The walls of the building have just been completed and though simple in design have a very fine effect. The roof, as the figures just given show is an important factor, in the design, and it is probable, that after the dome of the State House, it w ill be the first distinguishable feature of the city, by incoming vessels.

Boston can boast of few buildings that are high in thc New York or Chicago sense. The <building>Parker House </building>has long stood pre-eminent among those buildings making any pretentions that way, but the Fiske building is even more aspiring and a new nine. story shop on the corner of  Tremont arid Beacon streets will likely prove a dangerous competition in the race. This latter building, which is now well on to completion is a. Plate glass and iron construction, whose design has evidently been governed by the necessities of its owners,—a large retail firm. The two street fronts are almost entirely window space. Six granite piers about three feet wide extend from basement to roof, and these to the uninitiated passer-by appear to carry a good deal more weight than they seem able to bear.

An interesting piece of constructive engineering is now in progress here, in the shape of the new Howard Bridge, which is being built across the Charles River, connecting the west end of the city with Cambridge, The bridge is 2,160 feet long and has 23 piers of 75 and 105 feet span alternately. The plate girders are built on the eantilever principle. They are floated into place on scows, then lowered on to the piers, by letting water into the boats thus sinking them to the required depth—altogether a very interesting process to watch. The foundation for the stone piers is composed of spruce pines which are cut off two feet below water (the river here being affected by the tides. ) Four inch sheet piling is then built around them and a concrete cap is put on, the concrete extending down 8 feet amongst the piles, thus completing the work. <firm>Messrs. Shields and Carroll</firm> the contractors for the masonry work and foundations are a Toronto firm. This bridge is expected to be done by next June.

A new addition to the large number of statutes and monuments in this city, has recently been erected on the common facing Tremont street. The Attucks monument, as it is called, has been erected to the honor of the five men, (a negro, Grispus Attucks, being the leader,) who in the year 1770 fell in what is called here the Boston massacre. The memorial consists of a granite column and a bronze female figure with a. broken chain in her hand and an eagle with spread wings at her feet The shaft of the column is round but the base has been elongated on one side and on it stands the figure. The bronze work has been much admired, but the column itself has created some dissatisfaction and will probably be altered.

On Friday evening the 30th of November, the rooms of the lately organized architectural club were opened. The occasion was happily chosen as a fitting one to tender a reception to Mr. <person>Geo. F. Newton</person>, the third Rotch Scholar, who has just returned from his travels. The meeting was quite informal but nevertheless was much enjoyed by all present The numerous water color sketches, and pen and pencil drawings which Mr. Newton has made during his trip, were on exhibition, then, and during the following week, and have been much admired for their exquisite rendition and for the beauty of the subjects chosen.

The architectural club was formed last September for the social and artistic benefit of young architects and others interested in architecture Since its organization its membership list has grown from twenty to over a hundred, rooms have been leased, and neatly and tastily fitted up and furnished1 and much enthusiasm has been kindled among the younger branches of the profession. Classes are being formed and with such teachers as <person>Ross Turner</person>in water colors and <person>D. A. Gregg </person>in pen and ink work are an assured success. The rooms are centrally located at No. 6 Hamilton Place, and all visiting architects and draughtsmen will be made welcome.





The following have been elected officers of the <assoc>Montreal Contractor's Association</assoc>for the present year President, <person>Wm. Rutherford</person>; First Vice-President, <person>Jos. Brunet </person>Second Vice-President, <person>J. R. Savignac </person>; Secretary and Treasurer, <person>A. Lapierre</person>.

On the completion of work on the <building>McClary Mfg. Co.'s new building</building>, at London, Ont., the contractor for the brick work, Mr. <person>Wm. Hayman</person>, entertained his employees at a banquet. Among the guests was Mr. <person>J. M. Moore</person>, the architect of the building.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)

THE past year on the whole has been a successful one as regards the

 building trade. At the commencement of the year, there was a decided disinclination to undertake any large contracts without a very large margin for a possible rise in the labor market. This, though causing a stagnation in affairs at the opening of the season, was soon settled on a normal basis, and, as a matter of fact, the cost of building has compared favorably with that of previous years. The following is a brief resume of some of the principal building operations:

The <building>Canadian Pacific Railway depot, on Windsor St</building>., a magnificent stone structure, modern Romanesque in style, of which Mr. <person>Bruce Price</person>, of Boston, is the architect, cost, over $500,000, is now- nearly complete, and the various departments are taking up their quarters in the new building.

The new <building>Bonaventure station of the Grand Trunk</building>, replacing the infamous old wooden structure, is also completed and in working order, having been examined by the City Surveyor and duly subsidized as agreed by the city council. The building is of red brick and terra cotta throughout, and was designed by <person>Mr. Scott</person>, of Ottawa.

The <building>Protestant Insane Asylum</building>, after creating an amount of wrangling (tending to qualify some of the rival partisans as future inmates) is partly ready for the roof, the work having been pushed forward by Messrs. Stuart and Quinlan, the contractors, under the superintendence of the architects, <firm>Messrs. T. W. & E. C. Hopkins</firm>. The total cost will amount to some $125.ooo. The above firm are also engaged in carrying out a large extension at the " <building>Windsor Hotel</building>," the foundations of which have been put in. The design includes a large hall and concert room, the details of the wood work and finishings being very chaste and good. Messrs. Hopkins are also completing the large eight story warehouse (illustrated in your columns) on Craig street, for Mr. <person>T. C. Wilson</person>, the front of which is of pressed brick and terra cotta on a story of colored :sand stone, the stone work being executed by Messrs. <firm>Barbeau & Fournier</firm>, the brick and terra cotta by <person>P. C. Wand</person>, and the woodwork by <person>E. Roberts</person>.

St. James St. , however, has seen the " boom " localised—nearly every building of importance having either undergone, or being about to undergo renovation of some kind.

The colossal premises of the " <building>New York Life Insurance ' building </building>on the corner of Place D'Armes Square, which completely dwarfs the towers of the French parish church, is now complete as regards the exterior, and will be occupied early in May, Messrs. <firm>Babb, Cook and Willard</firm>, of New York, are the architects, the masonry having been well executed by <person>Peter Lyall</person>, and the carpenters and joiner's work by Simpson & Peel.

Nearly opposite, the old C. P. R. offices have received such sweeping alterations and enlargement by the same contractors, under the superintendence of Mr. <person>C. Clinton</person>, architect, New York, as to be hardly recognisable. The facade is effective, with an open colonnade of Corinthian columns over the original Doric and ionic orders. It will be occupied in May by the Imperial Fire and Life Insurance Company.

From this westward, the whole aspect of St. James St. is changed—first, by the large red sand stone block of stores and offices erecting on the site of the old Methodist church, of which Mr. <person>A. P. Dunlop </person>is architect, the stone work being carried out by <person>H. Hutchison</person>, and the carpenter work by W. McDonald. The new Methodist Church on St. Catharines St., by the same architect, will be opened early in the summer, the school and class rooms being already occupied.

The City and District Savings Bank opposite, has been remodelled and an additional story added, forming fine suites of offices with elevators and modern appliances, at the hands of Mr. A. Raza, architect, who has also rebuilt the premises of Messrs. Bourgeau and Perrault, making a bold and effective front of the buildings which were burned out a year ago.

" Nordheimer's Hall " is also approaching completion, the premises having been completely gutted after the last fire, and rebuilt as stores and offices with granite front, by Mr. T. R. Browne, architect, who also has in hand the " Royal Insurance " Company's building at the corner of Place D'Armes Square and Notre Dame St., also the remodelling of the Molson property on St. James St,, at a cost of $20,000.

The Mechanics' Institute has had two additional stories added, and the interior formed into offices all fitted up in good style by Messrs. Wright & Fi ndlay.

The suburbs are full of new villas, some of harmless character, others, "things to shudder at, not to see. Mr. A. T. Taylor is engaged on a large residence for Hon. Geo. Drummond, on Sherbrooke St., which is of a very high order of design. This house, with Sir Donald A. Smith's premises on Dorchester St., by Messrs. Hutchinson & Steele, ought to convince any impartial mind that there is no absolute necessity for importing foreign talent whenever anything more than the stereotyped 23 ft. front "villa residence" has to be erected.

The last named firm have also completed a fine block of eight houses on Sherbrooke St., for M r. T. Heenan, of New York, at a cost of about $8o,000.	These fronts are very effective, and free from the prevalent indispensable "Queen Anne" mansions.

The various departmental schools have received extensive alterations, and a large new school erected at the west end by the same architects.

A Methodist training college is in course of erection at Cote St. Antoine, by Mr. T. P. Hill, architect, at an outlay of about $50, 000.
