ARRANGEMENTS are well under way for Our New Year

	Number.	the publication of the New Year Number of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for



1898. The general character of these numbers has become so well known that concerning the one on which we are now engaged, it need only be said that we are striving to make it quite as attractive and interesting as its predecessors, and if possible more so. As usual an edition considerable larger than the ordinary one will be printed, and copies will find their way into the hands of many persons outside the list of regular subscribers. The building outlook for 1898 is brighter than for several years past, and those who have announcements to make regarding materials and appliances adapted to the requirements of architects and contractors in all lines should immediately arrange for space in the advertisement pages of this New Year Number. The announcements of yearly advertisers will appear in this number at no extra cost.



THE prospectus which has been issued outlining in a general way the requirements in the proposed competition for

plans for the University of California, is well calculated to awaken the enthusiasm of architects in the project. The programme containing the details of the competition, prepared by Prof. Gaudet, of the School of Fine Arts, of France, is now overdue, although we have not yet seen a copy. When printed, copies may be obtained from the architectural societies of America and Europe or on application to the Trustees, at No. 217 Sansome street, San Francisco, California. It is intimated in the prospectus that ample prizes will he provided and that "there are to be no definite limitations of cost, materials or style ; all is to he left to the unfettered discretion of the designer ; he is asked to record his conception of an ideal home for a university, assuming time and resources to be unlimited." It is further stated that " while the method of obtaining the architectural plan has not been decided on in detail, it is thought that it will be done by an international "concours," open to all the architects of the world, with an international jury of five members, who will have full charge of the "concours" and of the award of all the prizes." Without knowing the details of the scheme, It IS clearly apparent that it would be useless for any architect to dream of engaging in this competition unless he is possessed of ability of the highest order, backed by large experience and the necessary means to enable him
