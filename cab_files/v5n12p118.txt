<article title="The B.C. Institute of Architects" author="">THE <assoc>B. C. INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS</assoc>.



THE above Institute, which has now been in existence about eighteen months and embraces nearly 40 members, held



second annual meeting on Friday, November 4th, 1892, at Vancouver, B. C., with Mr. <person>C. O. Wickenden</person>, of Vancouver, Vice President, in the chair.

Minutes of the previous meeting having been read and adopted, the chair man read the following report of the year's work.

In the absence of our President it devolves on me now to read to you the executive report of what has been done by our Institute during the past year. Since our last annual meeting held in Victoria on the fifth December, 1891, we have been duly incorporated, after taking legal advice as to the proper means to that effect, under "The Literary Societies Act." Of this you have had due intimation in the issue of our "By-Laws and Declaration of Establishment.' This course your Council considered advisable in order to give us a proper legal status.

The next action of your Council that I have to bring to your notice is one respecting competitions. Your Council felt it advisable to address the office of Land and Works of the Provincial Government respecting the terms of an impending competition for Government offices in Victoria, The result of this co-operation was the issue of the instructions doubtless seen by you all (correspondence read. Shortly before the competition designs were to be submitted, we again addressed the Commissioner of Lands and Works on the subject of adjudicators. Rumors of a possible reference of the designs to an architect of the United States induced us to take this action, and here again I have to congratulate you on the ready compliance of the Commissioner with our suggestions, two of our profession nominated by the Ontario Association of Architects having been appointed to assist the Commissioner in making his selection.

Most of you are aware that during the year a competition for designs for a new <building>Christ Church Cathedral in Victoria </building>was arranged by the plans committee of that church. The conditions of this competition were considered b your Council as unsatisfactory, and several suggested alterations in the terms were made and forwarded to the secretary of that committee. These suggestions were not favorably received by them, the consequence being that very few designs were submitted from British Columbia, In consequence of the action since taken by the committee of the new Christ Church Cathedral issuing out of this competition, your Council again thought some action was necessary, and at a Council meeting held on Saturday, Oct. 15th, a sub-committee was appointed to go over the question and report. This report was passed as a resolution of the Council at a subsequent meeting held Oct. 22nd, and a copy sent the plans committee up to (late reply has not been received from them.

These matters are referred to, to show our members to what extent matters affecting our position as architects have received our attention. Probably the most important action taken during the past year has been the attempted passage in the Local Legislature of our " Bill respecting the Profession of Architects," which, as you all know, was thrown out by the small majority of one, the time of its being voted on being late on a Saturday at the fag end of the session, with a very few members present. It is a question for your consideration whether the Act should be brought up again at the next session of Parliament or not.

Your Council at a meeting held on Saturday, Oct. 22nd, passed the following resolution having reference to By-law 6 That in accordance with By-laws 1-6 the following gentlemen be invited to allow themselves to be nominated for election as honorary fellows Messrs. <person>F. C. Gamble</person>, <person>G. A. Keefer</person>, <person>H. B. Smith</person>, <person>W. S. Gore</person>, <person>Joseph Hunter</person>, <person>Edward Mohun</person>. It remains with you now to adopt this report or not and if you have other nominations to make to add to the above.

I have to regret to add that one of your Council, <person>Mr. Trinen</person>. had resigned owing to continued ill health. At the Council meeting of October 15th, <person>Mr. Day </person>was elected to take his place (By—law 54)."

Upon the report being adopted, the vote was next taken for the members of Council for the ensuing year, when the following were duly elected

President, <person>C. Osborn Wickenden</person>, Vancouver.

Vice-Presidents, <person>R. Roskell Bayne</person>, Victoria: <person>Cornelius J. Soule</person>, Victoria.

Hon. Treasurer, <person>Edward Mallandaine, Sen., </person>Victoria.

Hon. Secetary, <person>W. Ridgway-Wilson</person>, Victoria.

<person>Thomas Hooper</person>, Victoria <person>John Teague</person>, Victoria <person>; Alan. E McCartney</person>, Vancouver <person>Richard P. Sharp</person>, New Westminster; <person>A. Maxwell Muir,</person> Victoria.

The gentlemen nominated above by the Council as honorary Fellows were duly elected, as were also Messrs. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, of Toronto, and <person>A. T. Taylor</person>, of Montreal, the experts appointed by the Government in the late competition.

After some further discussion on the subject of the proposed Bill respecting the profession of architects, a committee consisting of Messrs. Soule, Bayne, and Ridgway-Wilson, with power

to add to the number, was appointed to consider what further steps should be taken in the matter and to report to the Council.

It was decided to hold the next annual meeting at Victoria, and the meeting adjourned.



<article title="Government Buildings Competition Victoria B.C." author="">GOVERNMENT BUILDINGS COMPETITION, VICTORIA, B. C.

Acting upon the suggestion of the <assoc>British Columbia Institute of Architects </assoc>the Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>were requested by the Government to nominate two non-competing Architects to act as experts in conjunction with the Honorable the Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works in the Government Buildings competition. Accordingly Mr. S. G. Curry, President of the Ontario Association, and Mr. A. T. Taylor, F. R. I. B A., R. C. A., a member of the Council of the Quebec Association of Architects, were appointed. After an exhaustive examination of the various designs these gentlemen handed in the following report, viz

VICTORIA, B. C., November 5th, 1892.



To the Honorable Chief Commissioner of Lands and Works Victoria, B. C.:



SIR,—- In accordance with our appointment as experts to examine and advise on the plans submitted in competition for the proposed new Government Buildings, we beg to report as follows

Sixty-five sets of drawings have been sent in by sixty-two competitors. We have arranged and carefully examined same, and have selected the following five designs to compete in the second competition, viz

No. 19, Brittanicus."

No. 56 "A. B. C. Architect.'

No. 43, "St. George on Shield."

No. 25, " Utility and I Dignity."

No. 17, " L'Utile Dulci."

NOTE.- These are placed alphabetically and not in order of merit.

We have selected the above as most nearly fulfilling the conditions and requirements of the competition.

We regret that we were obliged to reject several designs of great merit on the ground that the expense of carrying them out would grossly exceed the limit of cost stated in the conditions of competition.

None of the designs submitted were entirely suitable in the internal arrangements of the several departments, owing, we think, in a great measure, to the inadequacy of the information furnished to the competitors.

We would respectfully suggest that as full information as possible of the requirements as to space, and the internal working of the several departments, be furnished to the competitors in the second competition.

We are, Sir,

Your obedient servants,



ANDREW T. TAYLOR.
