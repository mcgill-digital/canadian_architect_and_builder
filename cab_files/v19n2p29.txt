The Quebec Section of the Association reported a balance to their credit of $262.92, and their report was adopted; Mr<person>. D. R. Brown </person>making the suggestion that it would be a good thing that the Quebec Section should spend more of their receipts on the purchase of books.

On the call for the discussion of general business, Mr. <person>J. Venne </person>rose to suggest that the Association should do more in recognition of those who had rendered distinguished service to the profession. It had been, he said, the intention to confer the honorary membership of the Association upon the late <person>J. W. Hopkins</person>, but that gentleman's death had prevented the fulfillment of the intention. When old men who had worked well for the profession retire from practice their connection with the Association drops. Mr. Venne considered it desirable that such members should be eligible as honorary members and that others still practising, but of special eminence and distinction, should likewise be recognised by an honorary membership. It was resolved to recommend the Council to frame a motion to give effect to this suggestion.

The Secretary then read a letter from the Architectural League of America calling attention to its approaching meeting in New York.

A letter was next read from the Secy. of the <assoc>Royal Inst. of British Architects </assoc>in regard to the Seventh International Congress of Architects to be held in London in July 1906. It was explained that the Council of the P.Q.A.A. had decided to ask this general meeting to appoint any member a delegate to this congress who was prepared to attend it, and further to appoint some one to be president of the delegation. This was agreed to and, on the motion of Mr. <person>D. R. Brown </person>seconded by Mr<person>. J. P. Guellet, </person>Mr. Archibald was appointed President of the Province of Quebec Delegation.

On the motion of Mr. D. R. Brown the new Council were recommended to reconsider the method of electing officers and if necessary to prepare amendments to the by-laws accordingly.

Mr. Jos. Venne pointed out an anomaly in the present system whereby the President of the Association, when chosen from Quebec, might nevertheless
