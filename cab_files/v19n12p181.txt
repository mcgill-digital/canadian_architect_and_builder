decoration was made from his models. A building of definite character is to be expected from so much personal care on the part of the designer, and certainly the building is in character with its purpose. It looks like a club, a men's club and, one may almost say, a

young men's club. It is distinctly of this generation, but, fortunately, without relation to any American fashion. We have here the English tradition ; a free classic which does not wholly cast aside the Middle Ages. The long reading room, which extends across the whole front on the principal floor, has mullioned windows, with the internal effect shown in our illustration of one end of that room.

The hall and vestibule are lined with a pale, buff terra-cotta made in England by the <firm>Burmantofts Co.</firm>

A well planned house of this kind cannot depart far from a recognized type without going wrong. The variations occur in putting together the typical arrangement. Here the possibility of internal variation in similar plans seems to be inexhaustible. In the present plan the ground floor hall, on the lines of many thousand others, is a novelty, and suggestive of further development. People want now-a-days to use their hall as a sitting room or place to receive visitors. The stair is incompatible with comfort in this respect. It is therefore, here shut off by a screen and door, as shown in one of our illustrations. This, with the expansion of the fireplace, transforms the hall into a usable room. The fireplace bay, with the light coming from it sideways to the hall, is an essential part of she scheme, breaking up the tunnel effect.

The separation of the staircase by doors has already been practised as a means of making one stair serve for all purposes. This really seems, in view of the plan before us, to be the proper thing to do in small houses. The idea works both ways, reducing the tairs and adding to the living space.
