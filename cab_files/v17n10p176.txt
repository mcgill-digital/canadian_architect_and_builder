Mr. Sanford F. Smith, of the firm of Sanford & Smith, architects, Toronto, was married on September 28th to Miss Mabel

Beatrice	Breyman, of Ottawa.



At Woolwich Arsenal recently transverse breaking tests were made of plate glass from several factories, The thickness of the glass varied from 1/8 in. to 1 in. and thc span from 8 ins. to 24 ins. The modulus of rupture, which ranged from 2000 lbs. to 8,000 lbs. per sq. in., was generally greater with the lesser thicknesses. Of the various kinds of glass tested-—rough, ribbed, polished and wired—there was little difference in strength except that the wired glass showed a little greater strength than the other kinds. The strength was also greater for the "sandwiched rolled" than for the solid rolled wire glass. The strength of glass set in frames was practically double that of the specimens tested transversely.
