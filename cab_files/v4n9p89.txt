<article title=" GLAZING COLORS " author="">GLAZING COLORS.

GLAZING is a term which has probably been borrowed from the potter's art (If coating the ware with a transparent vitreous substance.

The house-painter uses the word glaze in speaking (If the setting of window-panes, and the word is used also by other trades when speaking of a finish that adds luster.

Glassy, transparent, is the correct meaning, therefore glazing colors are those possessing but little body, or covering power, and which are employed when richness and brilliancy are desired. 

Body colors may be rendered transparent or partially so by using but little color to a large proportion of vehicle but such glazing is of no value except to landscape painters, and not much to them.

There is no difficulty in producing a perfect glazing coat, when the painter knows how to prepare the foundation colors.

The self-taught painter, supposing that all colors are used the same, may worry over his carmine or yellow lake and wonder why they will not cover, and he may give up in despair; but the regular vehicle painter, knowing what is demanded, proceeds with a glaze with as little concern as he would for a body color.

Any body color which is to be used as the color proper should be fine, clean, and laid on perfectly smooth. This being the practice in good shops, glazing is merely the extra work of laying two or more coats of transparent color.

The glaze may be put on thin and but one coat given, which is practiced when it is desired to impart brilliancy to the tinder

coat. Brilliant vermilion is produced by a thin glaze of carmine over vermilion, and the same method may be adopted with the yellow and green lakes.

The common practice is to prepare the ground color so that it will closely match the tone of glazing color as it appears when mixed or " wet tip," for every color is slightly deeper in tone when wet or mixed in oil or varnish ; but the glazing colors are capable of a wider application, for they may be painted over grounds wholly opposite in color. Thus carmine may be glazed over lead color, black, and also over white, yellow, pale green, verdigris, blue, purple, violet and yellow lake; verdigris and ultramarine blue may be glazed over about the same range of colors, but when so used they are better adapted to narrow spaces, striping ornamental and pictorial work.

<article title=" STAINING OAK BROWN " author="">STAINING OAK BROWN.

A correspondent asks for a recipe for staining oak so as to match old brown oak. Wood is stained by the application of the ordinary' liquid dyes employed for wool or cotton. They' sink deeper into the wood when they' are applied hot. A decoction of oak bark produces brown of various shades, according to the quantity employed; so does an infusion or decoction of walnut peels. The above information is from Cooley's Practical Cyclopaedia of Practical Receipts. We have been told that <person>Condy</person>'s Fluid, mote or less diluted with water, will stain wood brown. If a very dark brown is required, it may be necessary to introduce a little black. In the supplement to the Scientific American, the following instructions are given for dyeing oak black, so as to resemble ebony ; and, of course, lighter shades of black can be produced at will by employing more water than is prescribed Immerse the wood for 48 hours in a hot saturated solution of alum, and then brush it over with a log wood decoction as follows :â€”Boil one part of the best logwood with ten parts of water, filter through linen, and evaporate at a gentle heat until the volume is reduced one-half. To every quart of this add from to 15 drops of a saturated solution of indigo. After applying this dye to the wood, rub the latter with a saturated and filtered solution of verdigris in hot concentrated acetic acid, and repeat the operation until a black of the desired intensity is obtained. ___________________

<article title=" PROCESS OF MAKING SLAG BRICKS AT KOENIGSHUETTE, IN SILESIA " author="">PROCESS OF MAKING SLAG BRICKS AT KOENIGSHUETTE, IN SILESIA.

THE slag is run into a large ladle containing fine coke dust, about one and one-half inches thick. 1 he ladle is then run upon wheels o where the bricks are to be made. The slag and coke dust are then mixed together with a curved iron or rabble. The gas generated by the coke is worked up with the liquid slag the product being a doughy sponge-like substance, full of holes, exceedingly light and possessing sufficient elasticity in the walls of the cells to meet the contraction and thus prevent fracture. This material when pressed into a brick does not require annealing. The bricks possess great strength with very little weight. and are capital non-conductors of heat and sound.
