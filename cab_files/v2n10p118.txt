W

E have received from a New York firm of publishers and Patent Solicitors the offer of some back numbers of their alleged architectural journal, "bound in handsome flexible covers in imitation Turkey leather," in return for a half column puff of their business. The publication is of the back number variety, and utterly valueless in the opinion of nearly everybody except the publishers who set such a high price upon

it.	Under the circumstances we cannot see our way to accept this exceedingly liberal (?) proposition.

Mr. <person>James Wolfe</person>, the founder and for many years the editor of the California Architect, recently formed a joint stock company of local architects to publish that journal in future, and was himself appointed general manager. The change appears not to have proved satisfactory to the parties concerned, and Mr. Wolfe has severed connection entirely with the concern. The architects will now assume (in turn we presume) the editorial chair. In the multitude of counsellers there should certainly be wisdom. It frequently happens, however, that work is better done by a single individual than if left in the hands of half a dozen.

We have been favored with a copy of the Kalendar of the <assoc>Institute of British Architects </assoc>for 1889-90. It contains, in addition to the Kalendar, with the dates of meetings, etc., marked thereon, a list of Members, Fellows, Associates, Honorary Associates, Honoary Fellows, Honorary Corresponding Members and Retired Fellows, besides a mass of other information of much value to architects in and out of the Institute. One of the most interesting features of the volume before us, is a copy of the late <person>Prof. Donaldson</person>letter, convening the foundation meeting of the Institute, dated 8th May, 1834, the names of the architects who attended the meeting, and the first address of the Institute adopted at a meeting held at the Thatched House Tavern, London, the 2nd July, 1834.



When the idea was first put forward that it was possible to operate high candle power incandescent lamps, in series with arc lamps, it was looked upon with suspicion by the electrical fraternity, but within the last year there has been quite a change of opinion, as it has been clearly demonstrated that by using a properly constructed cut-out, the incandescent lamps can not only be successfully but economically operated on the arc circuits. Of course this system can never be as satisfactory as either the direct or alternating systems, but for small towns, where the number of incandescent lamps is not sufficient to warrant the purchase of a separate plant, it fills the bill to a nicety.

<article title="A Tenacious Solder" author="">A TENACIOUS SOLDER.



A

N account is given in the Beliner of a soft alloy which adheres so firmly to metallic, glass, and porcelain surfaces that it can be used as a solder, and which, in fact, is valuable when the articles to be soldered are of such nature that they cannot bear a very high degree of temperature, the composition consisting of finely pulverized copper dust, which is obtained by shaking a solution of sulphate of copper with granulated zinc. The temperature of the solution rises considerably, and the metallic copper precipitated in the form of a brownish powderâ€”20, 30 or 36 parts of this copper dust, according to the hardness desired, being placed in a cast-iron or porcelain-lined mortar, and well mixed with some sulphuric acid having a specific gravity of 1.85. To the paste thus formed are added 70 parts by weight of mercury, with constant stirring, and when thus thoroughly mixed, the amalgam is well rained in warm water, to remove the acid and then set aside to cool in ten or twelve hours it is hard enough to scratch tin. On being used, it is heated to a temperature of 375 degrees Centigrade, and when kneaded in an iron mortar becomes as soft as wax in this ductile state it can be spread upon any surface, to which, as it cools and hardens, it adheres with great tenacity.





A patent has been granted <person>William J. Copp</person>, Hamilton, for a hot air heating stove.

An inexhaustible quarry of roofing slate is said to have been discovered at Howe Sound, British Columbia

A fine white powder, called aclinolite, is imported from Canada by New York contractors for sprinkling on the surface of newly-laid asphalt pavement to improve the color.

<firm>C. B. Wright & Son</firm>, of Hull, have received a contract for supplying 20,000 barrels of Hull cement to be used in the repairs to be made on the Cornwall canal.

<firm>Brenton & Adams, </firm>of Cumberland Co., N. S., have brought suit for $20,000 damages against <person>William. Dobson </person>for alleged depreciation of the value of the quality of a building stone quarry of which they are the owners.

A composition of matter called Firimite plastering, consisting in a mixture of air slaked lime, plaster of Paris river sand, cow hair mixed with serum, purified with carbolic acid, has been patented by <person>George M. Ford</person>, of Montreal.

The sub-contractors in the erection of the new Departmental Buildings at Ottawa, signalized the completion of the work by presenting <person>Mr. Mallette</person>, of the firm of <firm>Charlebois & Co. </firm>chief contractors with a silver Water pitcher and goblets, as a mark of their esteem.

A window glass trust is said to have been formed in the United States. The various works in the West have past into the hands of the United Glass Company, of New York, capitalized at $3,000,000. It is proposed to place the fifty-five window glass factories of the country under one management with main office in New York.



An old English recipe for a preparatory size for the gilding of plaster, marble and wood, obviating also the effect of greasiness in the grain of wood, is as follows:

Boil a handful of the leaves of worm wood and two or three heads of garlic in a quart of water until the liquor is reduced to one-half, previously adding for wood, and for wood only, half a handful of salt; then strain it through a cloth and add half a pint of water. When used it is to be mixed with a sufficient portion of good glue, boiling hot. The reason for leaving out salt in the application of the composition to plaster and marble is that any dampness would then occasion a saline effloresence on the gold.



The <firm>Toronto Electric Light Company </firm>is starting 100 new street arcs and building the plant for 300 more. The company. of which Mr. <person>J. J. Wright </person>is superintendent, have 560 city lights under contract, and run nearly 900 in all. They have put in a new 250 horse power engine and two 100 horse power boilers.
