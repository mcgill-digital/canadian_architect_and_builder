that it carries greater weight. Nevertheless, Mr. <person>T. R. Johnson</person>, who has signed a companion drawing of <person>Mr. Lennox </person><building>Beard Estate Building</building>, and is obviously the author of this, is to be congratulated upon a clear evidence of unusual talent. As to the hotel, if Toronto capitalists can build it, and Toronto's attractiveness can support it, we shall be very glad to see it. It may he questioned whether the received idea that hotels should be designed with some frivolity is correct, but this granted, the design in question is excellently carried out, amazingly so, when we consider that the style in which Mr. Lennox has worked out his large buildings, hitherto, is anything but frivolous. As a matter of fact, one feels sure that the gracefully Projecting consoled Cornices of this style mean galvanized iron, and sadness draws a veil over enthusiasm.

<person>Mr. Burke</person><building>Simpson building </building>of last year, now "the old Simpson building," will, we may suppose, be repeated in the more extensive new Simpson's building, which is about to rise from ashes. The problem, a packing box full of windows, is an exceedingly difficult one, and Mr. Burke had succeeded in giving a dignified solution without in the least entrenching upon the first requisite of such a building- abundance of light. Indeed the very determination to fulfil the conditions perfectly saved the design. Being full of light from top to bottom, the usual abrupt transition from solidity to plate glass is avoided, and though the show windows are unusually wide, the effect is unusually solid.

There is a design for a store front by <person>Mr. Wickson</person>, which, although it has a central gable brought by a pier plump down upon the middle of the girder, shows how suitable the mullioned gothic he has employed is for this kind of work; how much more suitable than the classic handling which has always prevailed. The English architects have now gone to Belgium in search of a style and the example has already made itself felt in this country and more of the same may be expected. If instead of looking merely for style our shop front designers would take a hint from the Flemish they ought to find the most characteristic fronts, which are simply inullions and glass from end to end, serviceable models for a store which is to be well lighted on each floor.

There are several other public and commercial buildings of various kinds which should he mentioned. <person>Mr. Taylor</person>, of Montreal, shows drawings of a new wing to the <building>Art Gallery at Montreal</building>, and the Notre Dame street branch of the <building>Bank of Montreal, </building>both of which are designed with knowledge and also well drawn. Mr. Taylor is evidently facile with his brush and has sent besides his own designs some water colour sketches of old buildings in Europe.

Messrs<firm>Clift & Pope</firm>design is a good commercial front.

Mr. <person>D. B. Dick </person>exhibits a photograph of the University Library arid drawings of the interior of the library reading room and of the gymnasium. The stack room is the most interesting because the most straightforward part of the library. This cause and effect relation never fails. When will a be recognized as the only sure road to sticcess?

Mr. Lennox's Athletic Club is a building of multifarious uses and has no leading motive such as the massive Romanesque requires. It is not a style that descends readily to the trifles of daily life.

The free handling of classic in Messrs. <firm>Gordon & Helliwell</firm>competition drawing for the <building>art gallery of Milwaukee </building>is good.

<person>Mr. Gouinlock</person>sketch for the <firm>Sheppard Publishing Co.</firm>'s building makes one hopeful for the coming Foresters' building.

Among the designs for churches, Mr. <person>W. C. Harris</person>, of Charlottetown, seems to have enjoyed the best opportunities and exhibits designs in a scholarly style for two handsome cut stone churches at Charlottetown. The interior of one of them is also exhibited and shows an octagonal crossing with the ceiling level with the nave and transepts, and showing outwardly as a small pyramid on the roof. A plan of this church would have been interesting.

<person>Mr. Townsend </person>has two very charming country churches which look to our mind as perfect in their way as any work of the living periods of church building. The wooden spires which make no profession of being stone and the country simplicity of other details do not impress one in the first place with their originality, they seem so fitting, but a closer inspection shows that this is original work of the first quality.

<person>Mr. Darling </person>who seems to be the church designer par excellence shows as great originality in another way. The examples shown, more costly than Mr. Townsend's, compare more directly in detail with old work, but the work is not so much an adaptation of gothic as an appropriation. It compares with old work but is essentially of our own generation. The modern multiplication of conveniences and the requirements of our climate ,usually evaded by a designer or concealed under the exterior of an ancient church which had none of them, all appear as features in Mr. Darling's design and the result is that his churches have a touch of the same more highly organized character that distinguishes our modern domestic work from that of former periods. The type is thus somewhat altered but the gothic feeling is perfect and the variety and interest of the features increased.

It is precisely this more highly developed moderns that most of the other designs lack and which chills interest in them not only in spite of their "correctness" but because of it, for it is not correct now.

Mr. <person>J. F. Brown </person>opens up another question in a well worked out design for the Chester Mission of the <building>Jarvis Street Baptist church</building>. At first sight this appears to be a pretty little Anglican church with an apsidal chancel. The plan, which is inserted on a smaller scale, shows that what appears to be a chancel is in reality the infants' department at the entrance end of the church, the opposite end from the pulpit and choir. Is this good designing or not? It is an adaptation of an old external form to an internal use to which the old form is perfectly suited. Instead of looking upon it as a chancel clapped on to the wrong end of the church, we may consider it as an expansion of the apsidal baptistery which was common at the entrance end and was like this devoted to the young. Nevertheless the design is disturbing. The natural man abhors it but has no arguments. The truth probably is that whereas the chancel was the glory of a church, this infants' department is a mere adjunct, to be connected with the church occasionally by opening folding doors, and the real center of interest, the pulpit and its surroundings, has probably no external expression but a flat wall and some little useful windows for the baptismal vestries, so that the design is in reality, turned round, proving once more the futility of imitation, even the cleverest.

Space fails to comment upon the dwelling house work, and indeed there are but few designs and no plans except on one of Mr. Townsend's drawings. There is little satisfaction in either looking at or discussing a dwelling house without knowing its plan. That which Mr. Townsend has shown for a $4,000 cottage in the country, is an admirable piece of work, and is carried out in elevation with the refinement and simplicity of true design. Scientific house planning is a study of our own days, and although the present exhibition is not strong in this class of work, it is satisfactory to know from papers that have been read in the Architectural Societies and printed in this journal, that the mind of the profession in Canada is turned towards its study; for it is the principles which have found acceptance in this branch of design that will be at the bottom of all true advance in architecture.



<article title="Questions and Answers" author="">QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS.

<firm>H. Bros., Kincardine, Ont., </firm>write: We want to build a brick chimney So feet high, square chimney. What size should the base be for this chimney, and should cement or mortar be used.

ANSWER.â€”It will depend largely upon the nature of the soil upon which the chimney is to be built, as to the dimensions at the base. If built on clay soil, allow about three tons to the square foot; if on sand, about four tons to the square foot. You should take into consideration also, the thickness of the walls. Unless the chimney requires to be rapidly constructed, the use of cement mortar is not necessary a good quality of ordinary mortar will be sufficient.
