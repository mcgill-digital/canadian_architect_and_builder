COLORING AND ENAMELING FACING BRICKS.

WHEN coloring white burning clay, for 100 parts of material are

required, according to the behavior of the basis material













For glaze coloring, 1.5 to 20 per cent. more of coloring matter will be required in proportion to the depth of the respective tone and the developing capacity the of coloring power of the respective oxides, as well as the height of the burning temperature. The many-sidedness of the subject is shown on the following compilation, there being considerable variation in the coloration, especially according to the more oxidizing or more reducing nature of the flame.
