TREATING HARD MAPLE FLOORS TO STAND CONSTANT WEAR.

The best treatment of hard maple floors, when the natural color of the wood is to be well preserved, is to apply not less than two coats of bleached shellac varnish to the prepared floor, but for good work three coats are recommended. The white or bleached shellac varnish for this purpose should be the article known to the trade as grain alcohol shellac, which is bleached gum shellac, cut with denatured alcohol and far superior in every respect to the article made with wood alcohol. As wax is objected to, the shellac, in order to prolong its life and yet keep the wood light in color should receive a coat of floor oil, composed of 9 parts raw linseed oil and 1 part drier, that is well rubbed in, which will produce a dull smooth finish. As the floor becomes worn, it should be gone over with floor oil at least once a month, if possible oftener, with a floor oil, that is made by mixing, say 8 pints of raw linseed oil, 2 pints turpentine and 1 pint white or orange shellac varnish. This should be applied with a brush and rubbed in by wrapping a cloth around a weighted floor brush, so that it becomes hard over night and does not remain sticky. Paraffine oil of pale color gravity, used in the same manner, will also clean and freshen up the floor, and in that way prolong the life of the shellac varnish.
