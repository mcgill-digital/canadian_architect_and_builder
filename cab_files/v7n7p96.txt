MEASURING MASONRY.

There are two widely different methods of measuring and estimating the value of masonry, to which we will find it necessary to attend. By the first of these methods the value of the rough materia1 in cubic feet is added to each successive kind of labour exercised upon it in superficial feet, in order to ascertain the final value of each piece of stone employed. In ashlaring the price of plain work is allowed to face, bed and joints of each stone, with horizontal bed and one vertical face only for bond-stones, unless they are through stones, when two vertical faces may l)e allowed. If labour is not charged on any face of a stone, half sawing is to be allowed for each lower face. Columns are measured by taking first two plain sides of the cube, added to the girth of the column as circular planes, and two plain faces to each horizontal joint. The material in solid steps is measured by taking the extreme length, including the tailing in the wall, by the width and whole height. Winders in the same, the width being the mean between the extreme end Widths. Labour on steps, if solid, includes plain, sunk, or moulded work on the face of the tread, riser, and ends only if laid on brickwork. To this half the bed is to be added if the step is laid on stone. For cornices, strings and blocking courses set on brickwork add the moulded, sunk or planes in faces and top to the plain work in joints, and allow no beds; but if set on stone, half a plain bed to be allowed besides, also half-plain to the back if worked. For

landings plain work is to be allowed on top, edges, and joints. If the underside be worked, to be charged half-plain superficial. Curbs are taken as plain, sunk, or moulded to the three faces, but no bed. For hoisting stone above 10ft, from the ground level an additional 2d. per cubic foot for loft, in extra height is to be understood, unless otherwise specified. The second method of estimating masonry recognizes only the exact net cubic quantity of stone used, and affixes a definite and total price t() this, varying it only to meet cases, where vast differences of labour are palpably required, and allowing no extra or additional charges whatever under any circumstances. Thus we may have rubble or ashlar, as the case may be, in walls, including all plinths, grooves, arch stones, reveals to openings, string courses, copings, returns, etc., at so much per cubic foot net,

deducting	, brickwork, as they

all openings, and backings if of

may appear in the drawings or in the specifications ; in fact, tantamount to a lump sum for the whole piece of work. While it must be admitted that this wholesale method of measuring facilitates the progress wonderfully, it is equally undeniable that it is as uncertain in results as careless in process ; and, indeed, the exact and just measurer, even if driven to adopt this method ostensibly, will take the trouble to work out an average block or two of each kind of work upon the other and more correct system, and reduce the cost thus found to a set of prices per cubic foot in the required estimate.
