A BILL has recently passed the New

Compulsory

Ventilation, Etc.	York Senate which provides that every school house or other public building

hereafter erected in cities or towns of more than 5,000 inhabitants shall be provided with proper means of ventilation. It is provided also that prior to the erection or alteration of any school building a detailed statement in writing of the specifications and a copy of the plans shall be submitted to the local school board, accompanied by a sworn statement regarding the provisions made for sanitation, ventilation and fire protection. The word school house is defined to mean any building in which public or private instruction is given to ten pupils at one time.



ARRANGEMENTS are well under way for

Proposed Greater

Britain Exhibition	the holding of what is termed a Greater Britain Exhibition at Earl's



Court, London, next year, lasting from May until October. The undertaking, which is under the direct management of the London Exhibitions, Limited, a company formed in 1894, and having a paid-up capital of  £145,000, is receiving the approval and support of the Marquis of Lorne, Sir Charles Tupper, and other distinguished British and Colonial statesmen. The object, which is to bring together the products of the various parts of the British Empire, should commend itself to all who wish for a closer commercial relationship between Great Britain and her colonies. The Canadian government will be asked to grant an appropriation to cover the cost of a Canadian exhibit. Attention is called to the fact that exhibits intended for the Paris Exhibition of 1900 might with advantage and little additional cost be first shown at the London Exhibition. In view of the prevailing sentiment on both sides of the water in favor of closer trade relations, Canada should take advantage of every opportunity to make known her resources.



AFTER having given careful investigation The Proposed to the subject, Sir Oliver Mowat

Victoria Square.

has declared that there is no ground for the contention that the city of Toronto is the owner of the square on King street west formerly occupied by Upper Canada College. In view of this decision, the correctness of which is not likely to be called in question,
