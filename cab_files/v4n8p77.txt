THE plumbers, gas and steamfitters of London, Ont., having failed to induce their employers to reduce their hours from 54 to 50 per week and increase their wages from 23 to 25 cents per hour, have for the past three weeks enjoyed a holiday, while the master plumbers have been forced to take off their coats and "earn their bread by the sweat of their brows." The strike, which promises soon to cease, has brought a few outsiders to the city, and these, with the repentant strikers, who do not like the idea of resting without pay, are managing to keep pace with the work. The time chosen was inopportune, as most of the spring contract work has neared completion, and none of the trades have been troubled with too much work this year.



THE extent to which new and superior quality building materials have come into use within the last ten years, is well illustrated by the growth of the Canadian pressed brick industry. Five years ago pressed brick was a rarity. The few required were imported from the United States, and cost something like $40 per thousand, exclusive of duty. Three or four years ago some enterprising Canadians began to manufacture pressed brick, and in a short time were able to offer an article which stood a fair comparison with the imported brick, and at half the price. The result is a wonderfully increasing demand, and a multiplication of manufacturers from one to four- or five. Not only is pressed brick everywhere to be observed in the cities, but from the towns throughout the country there also comes a considerable demand. The facilities for cheap production are such, that it is believed Canadian manufacturers would be able to compete with advantage for business in some of the American cities near the border.



THE architects of the Australian colonies are fighting a battle for incorporation and registration similar to that in which the Ontario Association of Architects was recently engaged. Our contemporary, the Australasian Builder, is doing yeoman service on behalf of the movement, and in its issue of May the 9th, prints the full text of the Ontario Architects' Act. The Victoria bill includes several of the clauses which were thrown out by the Ontario Legislature, such as that no person but a registered architect shall be entitled to recover at law for professional charges, also that forbidding public bodies from employing any but a registered practitioner; and one that no certificate shall be valid unless the person signing the same be a registered architect. We shall follow with a great deal of interest the fortunes of this bill. It is our hope that the architects of the antipodes may not only secure legal recognition, but legislation which will be of more assistance to them in their efforts to place the profession on a proper footing, than that which obtains in Ontario.



A REPORT has recently been made by Sir <person>John Fowler </person>to the directors of the Railway Company in England, on thc condition of the bridges on the Company's lines. The result of <person>Sir John Fowler</person>'s inspection has given rise to alarm for the public safety. The report intimates that no less than eighty bridges have been found to be so defective as to render their entire reconstruction necessary within a period of two or three years. The demand is made for a Royal Commission to define the enduring qualities of iron under the stress of moving loads,
