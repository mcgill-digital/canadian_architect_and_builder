Fire Proof

GLASS Windows

THAT ARE

FIRE-PROOF

These windows in a lire-proof building, complete the security, and in any building will thoroughly prevent the spread and advancement of the fiercest flames.



Better than iron shutters (even if they happened to be closed at the needed time) ; fireproof glass remains intact, resisting both the intense heat of the lire and the action of water.

It's adoption lessens insurance rates.
