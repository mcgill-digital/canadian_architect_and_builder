<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



of public buildings is the following, adopted January,



1890:



No church, hospital, college, school, hail, theatre or other building of a like nature shall be used or hereafter constructed unless the same contains such a number of doors, halls, stairs, stair railings and other means of egress of sufficient size and strength as in the opinion of the Inspector of Buildings shall afford ample facilities for free and rapid egress in case of fire, panic or other cause. No such building shall be erected or altered until the plans shall be submitted to the Inspector of Buildings and certified by him as conforming to the requirements of this byâ€”law.''



It will be seen that the character of construction is not defined, but everything is left to the opinion of the Building Inspector. What that opinion is worth may be learned by an examination of the theatre building tinder present consideration.

There is no more important duty confronting the new city architect and the City Council than that of preparing and adopting at the earliest possible moment an up-to-date building by-law.

THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CAPITAL.

The Ottawa Improvement Corn mission appointed to disburse the yearly grant of $60,000 by the Dominion Parliament for the beautifying of the city are going about their work in a wise manner, by first securing the advice of an expert as to what should be done. For this purpose the Commission engaged the services of Mr. Frederick G. Todd, landscape architect, of Montreal, whose preliminary report is before us.

Mr. Todd points out that the proposed improvements should be national in character, as befitting the capital of the nation. He properly emphasizes the wisdom of looking far enough ahead to provide for the future requirements of a city which he estimates will in fifty years have a population of 300,000. The exercise of such wise foresight will save large sums of money which would otherwise have to be spent in the future in removing obstacles out of the way. The report states that while Ottawa can never be "the Washington of the north," as some writers have predicted, because its topographical situation is entirely different, its location and surroundings are such as admit of development on an even grander scale.

As a capital city it is suggested that the parks and open spaces should be numerous with ample boulevards and parkways skirting the different waterways as well as connecting the principal parks and public buildings.

Tile principal suggestions are that forest reserves be secured in the Gatineau Valley and at Marsh Lake, which should contain specimens of the trees comprising the once great forests; that suburban parks be established as follows : 100 acres adjacent to Rockliffe Park, including the shores of Hemlock Lake, and east of Rockliffe Park along the river as far as the rifle range

just below Remous Rapids at the west end of the city on both sides of the river west of Herdman's Bridge, at the south end of the city; and at the mouth of the Gatineau river extending to Pond Creek for the adjoining city of Hull.

The report suggests the location of connecting boulevards, including a drive along the bank of the Ottawa river between Rideau Hall and the Parliament Buildings, which, on account of its magnificent views would become famous the world over. This boulevard should terminate in a monumental circle which could be

made to form in connection with Dufferin Bridge, a dignified approach to the Parliament Buildings. To this end Dufferin Bridge should receive proper embellishment. Emphasis is laid on the necessity for the preparation of a proper plan showing in detail how these improvements should be carried out in advance of any action being taken in that direction, also the importance, once a plan is decided upon, of allowing no departure therefrom.
