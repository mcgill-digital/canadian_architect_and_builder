Borders may be darker than the mass of the type or equal in weight ; they rarely look well if they are lighter. We usually set them too far from the type.

Capitals are often the only means of giving relief or accent to a page. We seem to be afraid of using them large. For clearness of reading the Roman are preferable, for that is their strong side, as Gothic is of the lower case. Where clearness is not the great essential, either Roman or Gothic capitals may be used, and either may be ornamented. Always presuming that the run-on matter is in black, the capitals may also be in black or in color. The weight of the capital should be in keeping with the lower-case. If it is in black it ought not to be so heavy as it may be if printed in color, and may be bolder as the color employed is lighter. If two colors are employed, we should be aware of their mingling effect. The colors always seem brighter if used in simple mass or it relieved by a white line.

It is possible to ornament a capital and yet keep the shape of the letter clear, but I do not think 'that is always necessary. The types should come fairly close to the capitals. It is extremely difficult to ornament a capital with figures or animals. In a piece of display printing I like to keep the unity and to use as few styles of types and even as few sizes of the same type as possible.

Illustrations other than the purely utilitarian should ornament a page as well as be a means to the further comprehension of the subject. They should be in line, and the thickness of line employed should be in keeping with the weight of type. Half-tone photographic reproductions are out of all sympathy with type.

Most commercial work, dictionaries, medical and scientific works, should be entirely free from ornament, so also should works having illustrations of a purely utilitarian character, as any ornament would be sure to be out of keeping with them.

When arranging an ornamental page 1 always get the lettering right first. If type is to be used it is set first, or if the whole is to be drawn the lettering is decided first, and then the ornament is made in keeping or agreement with it. It is always difficult to make a pen line agree with type. To be simple in design requires more knowledge, more thought, greater selection, and a higher sense of ornament, than to be elaborate. With such a frank instrument as a pen, it is more difficult to draw a thick than a thin line.

A drawing for photographic reproduction should be very slightly, if any, larger than the intended size, as much reduction destroys the quality of penmanship, and we should always bear in mind that in much reduction heavy black parts still remain black while the lines may be reduced to scratchy fineness, thus producing an exaggerated difference between them.

As letterpress printing is a method of impressing characters by means of raised stamps, it should not have its peculiar quality taken away by hot-rolling the paper afterwards ; it takes away the slightly varying surface caused by the impress, and makes the matter look flat on the surfaceâ€”a result so insipid in lithography.

When looking at a book the two pages are seen together and should bear a relation to each other ; the margin in the binding should be narrowest, the head margin larger, the fore margin larger still, and the tail largest of all this for convenience of handling as well as to avoid the appearance of the pages flying away from each other.





<article title="Tests of Building Materials" author="">TESTS OF BUILDING MATERIALS.

No. 21 of the British Fire Prevention Committee's publications records the result of a fire test of an hour and a quarter's duration on a floor of steel joists filled in with concrete carried on corrugated iron, with a suspended ceiling of modern joists carried by iron hooks projecting below the concrete floor, and hooked on to the lower flanges of the steel joists, with wire lathing and plates on the under side of the wooden joists. The suspended ceiling fell during the test, and as it is noted that the concrete was slightly disintegrated on the under side, that is what might have been expected considering that, according to the section drawing given, the intermediate supports were by bolts fixed in the lower part of the concrete. This seems to have been a weak point, as it necessitated piercing the corrugated iron, and it is noted that "occasional jets of flame came from between the joints of the corrugated iron centering.

The floor deflected during the test 2 3-4 inches in the center, but subsequently returned to within one inch of level. The corrugated centering and the under side of the steel joists were red hot after the test, but this probably (or almost certainly) would not have occurred if the ceiling had not fallen. The result seems to he adverse to the principle of suspended ceilings, or at all events points to the necessity of better methods of suspension.

No. 22 of series records tests on two lath and plaster partition, one with wood lathing, the other with wire lathing; and on two brick nogged partitions, one with brick flat, the other with brick on edge. Both lath and plaster partitions were practically destroyed, the fire breaking through the wood-lathed one in twenty-eight minutes (1650 deg. Fah.) and through the wire-lathed one in forty minutes (1750 deg. Fah.) At twenty-five minutes after the commencement of the test the wire lathing on the side next to the fire was bare of plaster and the wire lathing nearly all down. In this respect it showed only six minutes longer life than the wood lathed partition. The brick nogged partitions kept the fire I from penetrating up to the end of the test, but the plaster fell from the brick fiat partition at thirty-three minutes from the commencement of the test, but not so as to lay bare the brick. The result seems to indicate that plaster stands fire better on brick backing than on lathing, whether wire or wood. It also appears that the' brick on edge partitions stood the test as well as, if not better than, the brick-Hat one, but this result may probably be regarded as accidental. London Builder.
