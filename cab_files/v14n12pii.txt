Gothic

Architecture

Of all styles of architecture the Gothic stands alone as native to our race. We have today examples of it at our very doors. In England it sprang haphazard from the debris of Roman construction, and its triumph has found a fitting monument in the great cathedrals of the British Isles.







Safford

RADIATORS 

Twenty years ago hot-water and steam heating were introduced,, and the fireplace of old, and the base-burner of the last generation became part of the past. The progress made in heating called for like progress in radiators. "The Safford" was introduced and swiftly accepted. Fitting tributes to their triumph are to be found in every home and building of importance the world over.
