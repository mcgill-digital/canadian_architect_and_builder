<article title="Tests for Arsenical Wall-paper author="">TESTS FOR ARSENICAL WALL-PAPER.

THE British Medical Journal says "A simple and easily applied test for wall-paper has been devised by Mr. F.

<person>F.	Grenstted</person>. No apparatus is needed beyond an ordinary gas jet, which is turned down to quite a point, until the flame is wholly blue. When this has been done, a strip of the paper suspected to contain arsenic is cut one-sixteenth of an inch wide and an inch or two long. Directly the edge of this paper is brought into contact with the outer edge of the gas flame, a gray coloration, due to arsenic, will be seen in the flame (test No. 1). The paper is burned a little, and the fumes that are given oft will be found to have a strong garlic-like odor, due to the vapor of arsenic acid (test No. 2).

"Take the paper away from the flame, and look at the charred end ; the carbon will be colored a bronze red. This is a copper reduced by the carbon (test No. 3). Being now away from the flame, in a fine state of division, the copper is slightly oxidized by the air, and on placing the charred end, a second time, not too far into the flame, the flame will now be colored green by copper (test No. 4). By this simple means it is possible to form an opinion, without apparatus, and without leaving the room, as to whether any wall-paper contains arsenic ; for copper arseniate is commonly used in preparing wall-papers. The first and second tests would be yielded by any paper containing arsenic in considerable quantities."



Yellow gold lacquer is the best varnish for gilded work.

For a paint to be used on metallic surfaces to be gilded, use a metallic paint in boiled oil. After it becomes thoroughly dry rub smooth before gilding.
