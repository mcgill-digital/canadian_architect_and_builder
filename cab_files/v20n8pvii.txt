UNIFORM FIRE RESISTANCE CONSTRUCTION.

The International Society of State and Municipal Building Commissioners and Inspectors have sent to the Governor of each state and to the Lieutenant-Governor of each province of Canada the rough draft of a bill which they are planning to have introduced in the legislatures of the various states and provinces. providing for a uniform standard which shall be required in the construction of every building erected in any town or city. Such uniform action, the society points out, is the sanest solution of the fire problem which, in a normal year, runs up an annual cost of $200,000,000 in the United States alone.
