The changing fashions in stone used for building purposes in all the large cities of America have called out many comments, not alone from practical stone men, but also from general writers who are impressed by the varying effects of city architecture. The brownstone fronts of New York, which formerly lined street after street, with their stately, if sombre facades, figure in every description of the city. As the brownstone yielded place to other materials, every visitor to the city felt called upon to record the change. About a generation ago one stone, although in several colors, was largely used in New York and in all of the leading eastern cities. It has everything to commend it beauty of color, fineness of texture, ease of working and durability. But its reign was comparatively brief. After a few years of high favor, it passed almost wholly out of the market and now scarcely a foot of it is used in New York and but very little in any of the American cities. Perhaps one reason for this is that it was not an American stone and that our architects and builders thought that they should give the preference to a native product. This was the Nova Scotia freestone. The buildings in which it was used that are still standing afford striking testimony of its excellent quality. About 1865 Mr. <person>Charles D. Archibald </person>furnished the Nova Scotia sandstone in what is known as the olive color for the wall around Central Park. This stone came from the Mary's Point quarry in New Brunswick. Stone in a wall like this in such an exposed position does not have the protection from the weather that is afforded by a building, but this has lasted admirably and few freestones would have endured as well.

About three or four years later one of the first building jobs in the Nova Scotia stone was the <building>Dry Dock Savings Bank on Fourth Avenue</building>, which is still standing. This stone was furnished by the late <person>G. P. Sherwood </person>from the "Budro" quarry on the Petit-Codiac river in New Brunswick. Mr. Sherwood also furnished the stone for the old Hanover bank building, on the corner of Pine and Nassau streets, recently torn down to make room for the new twenty-two story structure of pink Milford granite. When the old building was destroyed it was seen that the stone had weathered perfectly, that every arris was as sharp as when originally cut and that the carved work still bore the mark of the chisel. Many other important buildings were erected of this stone, among them being the block at the corner of Forty-fifth street and Sixth avenue, from the Sherwood quarries, and the <building>Sloane building on Broadway</building>, of brownstone from Mary's Point.

In the New England cities the Nova Scotia freestone was held in still higher favor and its general use by the architects and builders continued for an even longer time. Among the notable structures in Boston which made use of either the russet or olive stone were the

<building>Fifty Associates building </building>on New Washington street, the Harvard buildings on Arch street, the <building>Boylston Bank building</building>, the <building>Young Men's Christian Union on Boylston street</building>, the <building>Columbus Hotel</building>, <building>Parker Memorial Hotel</building>, <building>Hotel Commonwealth</building>, Dr. Lothrop's church, Providence and Lowell depots, the <building>Catholic Cathedral on Washington street</building>, and Prof. Agassiz's Museum, besides many imposing blocks of dwellings and business houses.

Although there has ceased to be any considerable market for this stone in the States, it is in good demand throughout Canada. There is every reason for this aside from mere local pride. Some of the quarries have been worked for a great many years, but the amount of high-grade stone that is still available is unlimited. In a few places quarrying is conducted at a disadvantage. On the River John and the River Philip, most of the quarries are below the river level. The method of working them is to build a dyke or dam along the shore, pump out the water within and then open a quarry. The objection to this method is that it is impossible to keep the water out at all times and it is well known that salt water has a very deleterious effect on sandstone. It frequently causes it to scale or chip and at the best it almost certainly leads to efflorescence. So general is this fact recognized that when the stone used to be shipped to the States on barges the dealers insisted upon its being stowed in the hold arid would not purchase it if it made the sea voyage on the decks. At Wallace Harbor the quarries are admirable, having level beds capable of furnishing fine platforms. The stone is overlaid with from 2 to 20 feet of stiff clay. This is a peculiar formation and has almost a leathery toughness. It has to be removed with a pick. At Kennetcook is found a dark brown and an olive and a blue grit, the latter of which is used for grindstones. A cargo of this grit was sent a number of years ago to the water shops at Manchester and other place in Great Britain, and the workmen declared it made the finest grindstones they had ever used. For some reason no great industry was ever built up at this place. Manuidie was also another place that was famous for its grindstones and scythe stones. These deposits were worked for many years by the Seaman Brothers, whose name was known throughout the world.—Stone.



<article title="The Builders Foreman and Clerk of Works" author="">THE BUILDERS FOREMAN AND CLERK OF WORKS.

At	a recent annual dinner of the <assoc>Provident Institution of Builders Foremen and Clerks of Works of Great Britain</assoc>, the chairman, Mr. <person>F. Higgs</person>, thus described the qualifications of a successful builders foreman and clerk of works "Every good foreman should be careful, accurate and shrewd, and should have patience, forbearance and tact, personal magnetism, organizing power, fidelity to duty—in fact, character. The Clerk of Works should be honest in purpose and action, disinterested, lair and unbiased in judgment, open-minded for new methods and ideas, not wanting in a due sense of proportion and able to see two sides to a question. The ideal foreman and clerk of works did not quarrel, but pulled together, for though there might be two ways of looking at a work, it must not be forgotten that there was only that one work."
