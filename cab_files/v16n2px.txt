The general features of this new tiling are endorsed by architects and engineers. It is noiseless, non-slippery, water and germ proof, as well as pleasing in appearance. It makes a quiet, restful floor.



The interlocking feature unites the ties into a smooth, unbroken sheet of rubber. The tiles do not fall apart or come up, and each being distict any color scheme can be secured. It makes a perfect floor for offices, court rooms, vestibules, halls, billiard or smoking rooms, cafes, libraries, churches, hospitals, hotels. For bath-rooms or closets it is an ideal flooring.
