Most of the talk about San Francisco is not edifying. One is reminded of the saying that

''wheresoever the carcase is there will the vultures be gathered together." Nearly every expert' who rushes into print seems to do so in a spirit of conscientious hustling; to assert that the evidence is in favor of his material as the earthquake-resisting, fire-proof, covering for steel construction.

The situation is rat her like that after the battle of Salamis, when the Greek generals decided by vote which of them was the bravest. Each general had two votes to cast. The result of the ballot, (every one receiving one vote while Themistoles got as many as the total number of generals,) showed that every one had voted for Themistocles as well as himself. It was considered therefore at Themistocles had been the bravest. Similarly we may consider it agreed that the number of testimonies in favour of the steel frame and me tells at any rate in favour of the steel frame. But for a disinterested opinion which one can read with real profit we must wait for an official report, such as was made after the Baltimore fire by Captain <person>Sewell </person>of the Corps of Military Engineers at Washington.

In the mean time— just to show how different the point of view may be which will be taken by a disinterested observer, whose motive is purely scientific discovery—a Japanese investigation is reported, concluding that there would have been much less damage from the earthquake if there had been good mortar. As people who have overcome difficulties of their own with earthquakes the Japanese are entitled to respect, even if we had no other experience of their scientific exactness.

This opinion has the merit that it opposes no interest. No material is disqualified by the suggestion that it would stand shocks better if laid up in cement mortar

—which appears to be the improvement. in mortar that is suggested.

The aggregate elasticity of cement extending throughout the height and breadth of a structure is sufficient to take up the movement of a severe earthquake. But the cure must be not only in the use of cement but in its continuous extension. Cement mortar iii the beds with vertical joints half empty can he no great improvement ; but if all the joints are full, and the cement is continuous throughout the wall ; the brick or other material embedded in it being merely a larger form of aggregate ; it seems likely, even to ordinary perception, that a considerable movement can pass along the wall without dislocating its parts.

FIRST PART



In the Report of the Bureau of Mines for Ontario, Vol. XIV., Part !, there is an admirable account by

<person>P. Gillespie </person>of the Cement Industry of Ontario, which will be the basis of this article.

Mr. Gillespie goes at considerable length into the nature, sources of origin and process of manufacture of cement, and describes the plant, the process and the product of each of the nineteen factories in Ontario, of which fifteen are producers of Portland cement and four of natural cement.

The chemical composition of cement is somewhat complicated. It includes lime, magnesia, silica, alumina, oxide of iron, and sulphuric acid and the exact nature of the processes involved in its hardening is (if we may judge from the fact that the Prussian Government and the <assoc>German Society of Portland Cement Manufacturers </assoc>have offered prizes for essays on the subject) not perfectly understood but the essential ingredients of Port land cement are lime and clay. The marl, which in all but one of the Ontario Portland Cement Companies is the source of the lime, contains all the minor ingredients.

Portland cement, as is generally known, means nothing more than artificial cement. The name was given to it by the first maker, <person>Joseph Aspdin</person>. from its fancied resemblance when hardened to the limestone quarried on the island of Portland on the south coast of England and known as Portland stone.

Natural cement is produced by burning an impure limestone which contains lime, magnesia and clay. These ingredients vary in different parts of the quarry. Some parts are over-limed, some are over-clayed, so that when rock is brought together from different parts of the quarry, though the total result is sufficiently well proportioned, the difficulty in accomplishing a constant and intimate mixture of the ingredients when burned makes the natural cement less likely to develop the strength for which good Portland cement has acquired a reputation.

The difference in strength may be gathered from Mr. Gillespie's statement that a mortar which will develop, in three months, an ultimate tensile strength of 200 pounds to the square inch may be made with

of Portland cement to 5 of sand, while a natural cement mortar for the same specification would require

to be mixed in about the ratio of	of cement to 2 of

sand.

This, however limits rather than bars the use of natural cement. If no great strength is required, natural cement has the advantage of Portland in respect of cheapness. The prices are about $0.90 a barrel for natural cement, and $250 for Portland. With these prices, and sand at $1.25 a cubic yard, it will be found that of two foundation walls, built, the one with Portland cement mortar and the other with natural cement mortar, according to the above specifications, that built with natural cement mortar would be the cheaper. A cubic yard of Portland cement mortar would cost $4. 12, while a cubic yard of natural cement mortar would only cost $3. 25.

Natural cement also sets more quickly than Portland cement. The former usually begins to set in five to forty minutes, and attains its permanent set in twenty

minutes to two and a half hours.	Portland on the
