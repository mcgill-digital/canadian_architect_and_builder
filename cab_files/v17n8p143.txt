It has been calculated says a writer in The Builders' Journal, that the Colosseum at Rome accommodated 100,000 people. The height is given as from i6oft. to i8oft., but the tiers of seats inside did not rise to more than about half this height, the space above being necessary for ventilation. When such enormous crowds were packed closely together for several hours at a time on an Italian summer day1 with an awning drawn over them, the atmosphere would have become pestilential if there had not been a considerable space overhead, and at least one range of open arcades for the free circulation of air.
