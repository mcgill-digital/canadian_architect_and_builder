PERSONAL.



Mr. A. E. Nicholson, of St. Catharines recently a student of architecture with Messrs Gordon & Helliwell, of Toronto, has opened an office for himself in St. Catharines. Mr. Nicholson had already a building business ready to his hand when he came to Toronto, and, after communication with the Council of the Ontario Association of Architects, decided to article himself as a regular apprentice and prepare for all the examinations of the Association. Having passed all the examinations of the Association Mr. Nicholson is now a registered architect by examination, and, as a person who has fulfilled the ideal of the Ontario Architects Act in taking advantage of its Course of training, we hope he will have a distinguished success.
