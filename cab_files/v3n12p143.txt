64 Canada Street, Hamilton, Ont



























ARCHITECTS AND CONTRACTORS:

Gentlemen:	I take this opportunity of bringing to your notice my Flat Wire Lathing, for which patents have been issued in the United States and Canada. The object of the patent is to provide a light, yet substantial Fire-proof Lathing which offers a smooth, unbroken surface for the reception of plaster, and on which the plaster will key securely. Being made of flat wire, it offers the best plastering surface of any wire lathing. The key is an absolute certainty and is obtained by the plaster turning over the edge of the wire; this will be found invaluable in the plastering of ceilings. Its many advantages over Round Wire Lathing are apparent. An adjustable foot made of sheet metal, having two hooks, is attached to the lathing and takes the place of furring. By means of these feet the lathing can be fixed in position at one-half the cost of lathing requiring furring. After the cloth is woven the feet may be attached in any position required. The cloth may be used in either plain or with the adjustable foot as shown in cut.
