"EVERY ONE ADMITS ITS SUPERORITY."





Chatham, April 3, 1907

Dear Sirs,—Your consignment of "HERRINGBONE" lath arrived promptly. I have placed same in position, on Dominion Bank, Chatham, and find, although the building was much cut up, only yards of waste on 400 yards. (measured). To cover same with plaster, one coat, it took 8 barrels of lime and 40 of sand, exactly the same as wood lath. Every contractor and architect admits its superiority over other metal laths, on account of its stiffness, and ease in placing in position.

Yours very truly,

(signed) Richard Tipping.

 MOST Satisfactory."

Gentlemen,	The	HER

RINGBONE" lath, which you furnished us, has been used on the new Military Stores Building here, and, on inquiry from the plasterer, as well as the architect in charge, we find that it has been most satisfactory.

Yours truly,

"WILL USE NO OTHER '





Chatham, May 20, 1907



Dear Sirs,—In the construction of the Waterloo County & Country Club House, between Preston and Gait, we used your "HERRINGBONE" lath, and it convinced us that it was the best metal lath we have ever used. It being very rigid, does not spring away from the trowel, therefore taking less pains in trawling to do a good job. We can recommend it to all parties in need of lath. You may depend, we will use no other. Yours very truly,

The Chatham Fireproof Construction Co.

A.	E Drew, Manager.
