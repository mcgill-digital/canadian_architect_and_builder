<article title=" SUBJECTS FOR WALL DECORATION " author="">SUBJECTS FOR WALL DECORATION.



One of the first requisites in designing a subject for decorating a wall is to make it fit the space as if the shape had been made for the design, and this is clearly dependent upon the skill of the painter ; at the same lime, to the painter who knows the resources of his own art, every new shape will suggest a new modification of the composition of even a hackneyed or commonplace subject. For as the fine arts consist in the application of forms and colors so as to make a given appeal to the mind, the arrangement of lines and masses in a composition may be varied to suit. the requisition of decorative art, but the idea must still be conveyed in its full integrity. It is in this sense we must understand <person>Fuseli</person>s observation, '' lie that conceives a subject twice has not conceived it at all." Every subject has some peculiarity which distinguishes it from every other of its class some point at which that peculiarity is most fully developed and which should be rigidly adhered to by the artist. The '' dressing up" of this point of the subject, to which Fuseli limits the admissibility of second thought, is, in fact, the application of what should in strictness be called the art of the full development of the idea, with all the advantages the situation will admit of.





<article title=" METHOD OF PREVENTING STRIKES " author="">METHOD OF PREVENTING STRIKES.



Mr. <person>William. H. Sayward</person>, secretary of the <assoc>National Association of Builders of the United States</assoc> is said to be meeting with much encouragement in New York city in his endeavor to secure the adoption by employers and employees in the building trades of a method of adjusting wages.

The plan briefly outlined is the establishment of a court of settlement and appeal which shall have as its permanent members three persons entirely outside the constituency of the building trades, and to be selected as follows One by the workmen of all the trades acting collectively through committees appointed for the purpose, and these two to select a third, also outside the constituency. These three persons are to be preferably m en of legal training and judicial character and of such high standing in the community as to lend dignity to the tribunal ; they to practically furnish the balance of the court and preserve the community's interest in the conduct of the court's function. These three permanent members of the court form the nucleus. The full court is to be composed by the selection of three workmen and three employers who joined with the three permanent members will make a court of nine. These workmen and employers are to be selected from each trade and to act consecutively in sitting in the interest of that trade in making annual agreements. 'the three permanent members thus sitting with six representatives of each trade in succession will be able to preserve the decisions from conflict and complication one with another and will from their character lend dignity and significance to the decisions of the court, while at the same time bringing the whole determination of affairs for the building trades upon an infinitely higher plane than they have previously been.

All decisions of the court will be open to the public, and will be conclusive and binding upon all parties. During each year the court will be available for reference in case either employers or workmen in any

branch fail to live up to the agreement as announced, the whole to be determined by the court, and no strike or lockout of any name or nature be permitted under any circumstances.

Any new features or ideas looking to a change, modification or extension of the rules for any trade during the interim between times of annual agreements are not to be permitted because of abandonment of work, but are to be referred to the court for consideration and digestion during the balance of the year, and are to come up for actual consideration at the time of the next yearly agreement.

From the statements above presented it will be seen that this is a radical, yet at the same time, comprehensive plan, and simple in its principle. It is based entirely upon the idea that it is possible to settle the affairs of mutual concern to employers and workmen, in the building trades at all events, upon lines that are just., fair and businesslike.



<article title=" AS MAY BE REQUIRED " author="">"AS MAY BE REQUIRED."



A great deal of carelessness is shown in the preparation of specifications. That the aid of the courts is not more frequently invoked to interpret disputed points is often due to the fact that it is cheaper in the end to pocket a certain loss than to incur legal expenses that may run into the thousands of dollars. A very important case, which bears a lesson to all contractors, was brought up by Messrs. <firm>Stewards & Company</firm>, stone merchants and quarry owners of Portland, England, against the British Admiralty. The case really turned on the meaning of the words ''may be required." In announcing the decision "The Architect and Contract Reporter," of London, says

When the tender was accepted by the <person>Director of Admiralty Works</person>, he used the words ''about 2,000,000 tons, or such quantity as may be required, of cap and roach stone." The question was, did the phrase ''may be required" relate to a less quantity than 2,000,000 tons, or a larger quantity? It was contended on the part of the government that the Admiralty need only take the quantity they required and not the amount that was necessary for the construction of the breakwater or any definite portion of the works. There is no doubt the official documents were loosely drawn. But in the consideration given to the case in the house of Lords by the Lord Chancellor and Lords <person>Davey</person>, <person>Robertson</person>, <person>Shand </person>and <person>Brampton</person>, it was treated as if it were a transaction between ordinary individuals. Mr. <person>Justice Day </person>had decided in favor of the contractors, and his judgment was approved in the court of Appeal but in the house of Lords it was held that when the director spoke of '' such quantity as may be required

it was to be understood that the Admiralty could at any time cease to draw stone from the heaps belonging to Messrs. <firm>Stewards & Co.</firm> In other words, the plaintiffs were bound to have a supply of 2,000,000 tons available, and within that amount the contractors could take as much or as little as they pleased. Although the argument could not be brought before their lordâ€” price 

ships it is well known that the	charged for stone

depends generally on the quantities to bc taken. The Admiralty, by proposing to take 2,000,000 tons were able, as it were to obtain a wholesale price, whereas it their intentions were known, a much higher retail price should have been quoted. The ease should serve as a warning for it shows the necessity of precision in the phraseology of contracts relating to materials.
