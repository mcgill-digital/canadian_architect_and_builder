<doctype type="text">July, 1891 THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER	71



WE publish elsewhere in this issue an abstract of a paper on "House Sanitation" by Mr. <person>Willis Chipman</person>, C. E., Toronto, which was prepared for the <assoc>Association of Executive Health Officers of Ontario</assoc>, The suggestions contained therein are more particularly applicable to small towns, villages, and the poorer districts or suburbs of cities, and the advice given is eminently practicable. The writer has shown that the poor man may be supplied with sanitary conveniences sufficient for his needs, and that cities and towns may improve their sanitary conditions without oppressing him by excessive taxation and without any great expenditure. The "Brantford plan" of earth or ash closet is recommended for localities destitute of sewerage, or where for reasons of cost or otherwise a system of plumbing is impracticable. This method should be adopted in the tenement districts of Toronto where there are more than 12,000 privy pits, and where it would be impossible to introduce water closets by reason of exposure to frost. We must confess to being rather skeptical in regard to the inoffensiveness of an ash closet which is only emptied once a month, except where the users are of exceedingly careful disposition, and fear the closet where only average care was bestowed would prove decidedly offensive in very warm weather. In Lorne Park where a similar system is in use, we understand the removal is tri-weekly for the very reason cited above. The disposal of garbage by burning in the kitchen stove is another point which it is almost impossible to observe in practice. Not one domestic in fifty will attend to it faithfully, and many careful housekeepers will not permit it, averring as a reason that it is decidedly injurious to the range. A method of cellar drainage is recommended which is incomplete in that it makes no provision for keeping the trap supplied with water in seasons when there is not sufficient subsoil water flowing to preserve its seal. A rain water pipe should be connected to this trap to prevent such a contingency. The proposal to "ventilate" the w. c. compartment of a house into the "cock loft" is a most ostrich-like proceeding. If the room cannot be ventilated into a warm flue it would be better to make it airtight and to rely for ventilation on a small window opening directly to the outer air. The pamphlet is a contribution to sanitary science which must prove of decided benefit in the direction intended, and we commend its perusal to the local authorities and health boards of the country.



<assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.

THE season's work was brought to a close on Tuesday evening, June the 24th, by a social gathering held at the <building>Toronto Art Gallery</building>. The members turned out in large force and a number of visitors were present, including members of the <assoc>Ontario Society of Artists </assoc>and <assoc>Art Students' League</assoc>. Songs, recitations, ventriloquil imitations, instrumental selections, smoking and light refreshments were the means of making the evening pass very pleasantly. Those who contributed to the first part of the program were Messrs. <person>L. Carlisle</person>, <person>J. J. Woolnough</person>, <person>Henry Simpson</person>, <person>J. A. Pearson</person>, <person>Fairweather</person>, <person>C. H. Westwood</person>, <person>J. F. Brown</person>, <person>E. B. Jarvis</person>, <person>W. Carlisle</person>, <person>H. D. Allardyce</person<person>>, R. Wilson</person>, <person>Sam. Jones</person>, Smith, <person>J. L. Telford</person>, and <person>Acton Bond</person>.

Late in the evening the meeting broke up, after "Auld Lang Syne" and "God Save the Queen" had been sung in a hearty manner.



<article title=" THE MONTREAL BOARD OF TRADE BUILDING " author="">THE MONTREAL BOARD OF TRADE BUILDING.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



SIR,—I was pleased to see the accepted design for the Montreal Board of Trade building published in your last issue, and also to see in the same number a view of the <building>Toronto office of the Bank of Montreal</building>. We are thus enabled to compare the work of local men with that of foreigners --- and to compare it, I think, without detriment to our own men.

I must confess to a feeling of genuine disappointment when I opened the journal and found such a commonplace design as that which was accepted by the Building Committee of the Montreal Board of Trade. To me, it has not one redeeming feature. It is merely a transcript of some of the successful firm's designs for warehouse buildings which have been published frequently in the American architectural journals—lifeless

—commonplace—artless. It is not even sound in construction, the massive front wall being carried on sults, and the ground

 floor front wall advanced several feet n order to gain increased space in the offices on either side of the main entrance.

Compare the above design with that of Messrs. <firm>Darling & Curry</firm>'s <building>Montreal Bank</building>, and there can be no question. of the superiority of native talent. The one is a studied, artistic production, indicating a carefully trained mind ; the other is a crude effort tossed off apparently by a man who has run short of ideas and repeats some of his old ones regardless of suitability or the artistic possibilities of the occasion.

	Yours, &c.,	CANADIAN.
