<doctype type="text">	August, 1892	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	81


<article title="The late W.G. Storm" author="">THE LATE <person>W. G. STORM</person>, R. C. A.
THE removal by death on the 1st inst. of the subject of this sketch, has taken from our midst one who has filled a very important place in the architectural work of not only this city of Toronto, but of the province of Ontario, during the last forty years.
He was of English lineage, born at Burton-upon-Strathar, Lincolnshire, England, October 29th, i826, and came to Canada with his parents in 1830. They left Hull, England, in a sailing vessel on the 29th May, landing in Little York, (now Toronto), in August of the same year. He has therefore spent 62 years of his life in Toronto.
As a youth he was apprenticed for five years to his father, who carried on an extensive business as a builder and contractor, and he early developed a taste for architecture. When 18 years old he was articled to the late Mr. <person>William Thomas</person>, an architect of great taste and skill in Toronto, in whose office he continued for some years
In 1848 he became associated with the late <person>F. W Cumberland</person>, Esq., as assistant. In 1849 old St. James cathedral was burned, which was the second destroyed by fire on the same site. Plans for a new church were advertised for, premiums offered, and the fist prize was awarded to the plans prepared, it is said, by Mr. Storm, in Mr. Cumherland's office. About the close of 1850 a partnership was formed between Messrs. <firm>Cumberland and Storm</firm>, and soon they became the leading firm in both city and province. <building>St. James cathedral</building>, <building>the Normal School </building>and <building>the Mechanics Institute </building>buildings were among their earlier work in this city, and among the counties of the province they had to do with many municipal buildings. The erection of the new University buildings in Queen's Park from an important era in the architecture of the city, and with them Mr. Storm was associated from the first in the development of the plans and details and the construction and completion of the buildings Thoroughness was an important feature in Mr. Storm's work, and owing to this and his practical knowledge gained by him in the workshops of his youth, the Toronto University buildings presented about as perfect a piece of building as could be found on the continent
The centre building of <building>Osgoode Hall</building> followed close on the completion of the University, and with this Messrs. Cumberland & Storm had to do. Opened in 1860 by the Prince of Wales, it was referred to as the finest law library building in the world. <building>St. James' Cemetery Chapel</building>, <building>St. Andrew's Church</building>, coiner of King and Simcoe streets, among others, were his work, and finally the handsome and commodious pile which his eyes just failed to see completed in Queen's Park, the Victoria Methodist College buildings.
At the organization of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>in March, 1889, Mr. Storm was chosen President, which position he held until the second annual convention of the Association which took place in February of the present year. This position was one of peculiar pride to him ; as well as to his associates to have him there. He was indeed an ornament to his profession.

A curious suit has been entered by the Queen of England in the New York courts to recover a cargo of asphalt recently brought from the island of Trinidad, and sold to the <firm>Standard Asphalt Company </firm>of New York. It seems that the island of Trinidad is the property of the British Crown. The principal source of asphalt in the island is the celebrated Pitch Lake, which is practically a mass of asphalt, or rather, bituman. This is collected by a simple process of driving carts upon the surface of the lake, which is solid enough to support them, and shovel ling the material into them ; and the price, on the island, of the asphalt so collected is about a dollar and a half a ton. The lake is entirely Crown property, but there are secondary deposits of asphalt in other parts of the island, which are least, or otherwise conceded, to private parties. According to the claim of the council for the Crown, the deposits of asphalt under private control are nearly or quite exhausted, and their proprietors have taken to replenishing their supplies of the material by poaching on the Queen's property It seems that this reprehensible practice has become so general of late that the Crown officers detain, where they can, all vessels leaving the island with car goes of asphalt until it is ascertained whether any of the asphalt was stolen from the Queen or not; but it is alleged that, in the present case, the vessel succeeded in escaping without being searched. On the other hand, the respondents assert that, as the Crown imposes an export duty of a dollar and a half a ton on all asphalt taken from the island, the Queen has already received the full value of the cargo, and that they believe the suit to be merely a contrivance to annoy them, devised by a rival asphalt company, which has made an agreement with the Crown officers, not to take asphalt from Crown lands American Architect.
