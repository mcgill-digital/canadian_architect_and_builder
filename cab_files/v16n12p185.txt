Architects will confer a favor by Our Students' Corn- directing the attention of their

students to our Students' Competition, particulars of which are printed in this number. Every industrious and ambitious student should find it profitable to take part in this competition.

A few years ago brickmakers in

	Giving Value to Waste Material.<article title=" Giving Value to Waste Material " author="">

a considerable quantity of what are known as 'clinker bricks," i. e., bricks uneven in color and shape and exhibiting protuberances on their surfaces. These peculiarities are due to the bricks being placed in the arch of the kiln where they are exposed to the greatest heat. An architect in looking one day at a pile of these refuse bricks thought he saw possibilities in them, and forthwith bought sufficient of them to build himself a house. The appearance of the house was pleasing and in contrast to the ordinary run of work. Other architects then saw a value in the clinker brick and began to use them. The demand so increased that the brickmakers themselves came to see the value of what they bad been accustomed to regard as a waste product and the price was advanced until now "clinkers" bring two dollars per thousand more than standard first quality.

Disputes.<article title=" Arbitration of Building Disputes " author="">

Ontario Association of Architects to have a clause inserted in all contracts providing that any disputes which might arise between contractors and workmen must be settled by arbitration. At the last meeting of the Toronto Chapter this request was fully discussed, after which a resolution was passed declaring that while the architects were heartily in favor of the principle of settling disputes by arbitration they could not advocate the insertion of an arbitration clause in contracts so long as the Building Trades Council or its component unions could not be held legally responsible for any agreement into which they might enter.



Where a number of contractors <article title=" Fixing Responsibility " author="">

Fixing Responsibility,	representing various trades are engaged on a building, an effort

is made to shift responsibility for any neglect or damage from one to another. Under these conditions the architect, who of course cannot be constantly on the work, experiences great difficulty in placing the responsibility on the proper shoulders. He has sometimes to spend much time and effort to get the contractors together in order that the difficulty
