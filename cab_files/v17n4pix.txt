A conference of representatives of the Ontario Association of Architects, the Architectural Eighteen Club, the Builders' Exchange and the Trades and Labor Council of Toronto, was held a few days ago in the rooms of the Ontario Association of Architects to consider whether an agreement might be reached in which matters under dispute between contractors and workmen might be adjusted by a board of arbitrators and strikes in the building trades avoided. The conference was of a very friendly character, and resulted in the ratification by the persons present of a form of agreement submitted by Mr. W. L. Symons, President of the Ontario Association of Architects. Copies of this agreement will be submitted to the Builders

Exchange and the Trades and Labor Council for further consideration and approval.

Mr. E. Rodgers, Building Inspector of Winnipeg, reports that up to the end of March, there were 127 permits granted for the erection of 215 buildings, at a total estimated cost of almost three-quarters of a million dollars, or to be exact, $719,000. In comparison with the same period of last year, the increase in the number of permits is 9; in buildings, 92; in expenditure, $202,580.

The Western Architect states that machine window glass is reaching the market and elicits most contradictory reports. Some lots are reported as very straight and clear, but thin; while others are said to be thin and anything but straight. A very high authority in the glass trade expresses entire confidence in the ultimate success of the process, and says that the thinness is now being remedied.
