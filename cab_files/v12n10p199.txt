Herewith are given, in part, the results of tests made under the direction of Professor Bovey in the testing laboratory of McGill University, Montreal, to determine the strength of British Columbia Douglas















































































































fir. There were tested, in all, twenty-five beams, of which the following particulars and illustrations are given Beam I was of good average quality, with annual rings as in Fig. 3. At 45,000 lbs. the beam failed by the tearing apart of the fibres on the tension face.

Beam IL was of good average quality, with annual

rings running as in Fig. 4. At 36,575 lbs. the beam failed by shearing longitudinally. After the fracture the load upon the beam was again gradually increased to 34,000 lbs. before a second failure occurred.

Beam III was of a specially excellent quality, with

































































































































clear, close, parallel grain, perfectly sound and free from knots, with annual rings as in Fig. 5. At 12,950 lbs. the beam failed by shearing longitudinally.

Beams 1V to VIII, sent to the laboratory by the British Columbia Mills, Timber & Trading Company, were cut out of trees grown on the coast section of British Columbia, and felled in the fall or during the
