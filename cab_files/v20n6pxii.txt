"ATLAS" BUILDING BLOCK

THE ONLY CONCRETE Building Block forming continuous "dead air" space (or hollow) wall. the entire length of the wall, including angles. Well "bonded" in wall. Warm in winter. Cool in Summer. FIRE, FROST. and Weather proof. EASY to build, having all the facilities of brick or stone work, for bedding plates. sills and bond timber, for joists. &c. Irrespective of face work. EASY to manufacture, no expensive machinery being required. Profitable to user and producer.

If a PARTIAL air space in a wall is beneficial (in any way), the WHOLE, or a continuous air space, must be MORE SO.

The ATLAS BUILDING BLOCK is rendered more DURABLE and TENACIOUS than ordinary concrete by the use of I. N. D. chemical Compound

—a cheap and profitable mixture to use in all concrete construction (at a cost of 40 cents per cubic yard.)
