<article title=" Toronto City Commissioner " author="">Toronto City Commissioner.

The City Commissioner's office remains in status quo for the present but must have a change, soon and the opportunity ought then to be taken to make its organization perfect. An offer has been made by the architects of Toronto to appoint an advisory committee to work with the committee of the City Council charged the reorganization of this department. The offer was made when it was understood that. reorganization was at the point of settlement. The matter was postponed but the offer remains and has been filed for reference. It only remains for some one to see That it is referred to. This is a good offer; one which will introduce into the reorganizing body the technical knowledge that is necessary; and help to make whatever appointment is made a serviceable appointment, settled upon its merits.



THE death of five firemen in consequence of a tailing wall, at the burning of the warehouse <firm>of P. McIntosh & Son</firm>, recently in Toronto, shows the need of a provision in the city building law to prevent the construction of walls which are too long for their height and thickness. Walls that depend for their stability upon the stay provided by the floor beams and trusses are a danger in fires. The wall of the old

street car shed, which was occupied by Messrs. <firm>McIntosh & Son</firm>, should never have been built of so great a length without cross walls. The ruins show a wall 40 feet high, running for 145 paces, or about 425 feet without cross walls. The proper thickness for such a wall would he a little over 3 feet ; the actual thickness is 18 inches stiffened by a buttress of 4-inch projection, at intervals varying from 16 to 32 feel. Buttress and all the wall is little more than half thick enough. Such a wall could be safely built only because stayed at intervals by joists and loaded with roof trusses ; an(l, when all these stays are taken away at once, with a shock, in the midst of the violent movements of air in a fire, its downfall is certain. It is not possible to tell from the outside how a long wall is braced ; and, unless the chief of the fire brigade is to he familiar with the plans of all buildings, he can never be sure that a long wall is thick enough to stay up after the floors tall in. The by-laws ought to have a provision which will assure him on this point, by making all walls thick enough to stand unsupported.



A notable insurance in Montreal recently of a contract to design and deliver a building for a fixed price, which in the case in question appeared to relieve a situation of some difficulty, raises the question whether this would
