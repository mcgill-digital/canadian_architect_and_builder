IT is pleasing to note that the press, The O.A.A. Act. with few exceptions, speak favorably

of the proposed Bill to amend the Ontario Architects' Act." Indeed it is not possible to understand how any well—meaning citizen can object to the proposed amendments, as they do not in any way interfere with the rights of any individual or prevent the public from taking advantage of the knowledge or skill, or both, of anyone practising architecture who may not be licensed under the Act. The Toronto World, while favoring the amendments, thinks there is a weakness in the Bill, inasmuch as it does not provide a designation for the unlicensed practitioner. ''If he is not to he known as an Architect how can he designate himself?" It can hardly he expected that he will be obliged to solicit business as an' 'Unregistered Architect," or that he will have to follow Webster and advertise himself as '' a person skilled in the art of building." Evidently The World has not read the proposed Bill, or its funny man " has taken advantage of the staid editor's absence. The unlicensed practitioner, according to the provisions of the Act, may designate himself whatever he chooses, so long as he does not call himself an "Architect." lie may be an '' Architectural Draughtsman," a ''House Designer," or he may advertise himself as "The Greatest Plan Prepare of the Nineteenth Century," if he so wills it. In fact, there is no limit to designation. Here is a sample which may be found in a newspaper published not over a hundred miles from Toronto "John Roe begs to inform the public that he is prepared to take all kinds of contracts for buildings, repairs, or furnishing materials for same. Plans and specifications for churches, stores and all other kinds of buildings, furnished on the shortest notice. listirnates given while you wait. P.S. If I get the contracts I make no charge for plans. Sash, doors and blinds always on hand. Live and let live. Give me a call." This, we think, is broad enough a "designation" to cover The World's objection, and the Bill proposed does not pretend to interfere with John Roe or his business. The public will eventually be the gainer if this Bill becomes law, not only because it will have some guarantee that the person interested with its work will be in a measure fitted for it, but because of the very fact of a license being required to practice, will prove an incentive to the aspirant for the public favor to better qualify himself for the expected work, knowing as he will know that he will meet in competition men of his own profession, whose knowledge and
