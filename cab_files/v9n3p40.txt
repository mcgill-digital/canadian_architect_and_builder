CONCRETE AS A FIRE-PROOF MATERIAL.

To the Editor of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AN!) BUILDER.



SIR, —I venture to submit the following quotations from a paper read by John J. Webster, M. Inst. C. E., before the Institute of Civil Engineers, London, Eng. (Paper No. 2518, Vol. C V, page 256, et. seq.)

d Concrete.—- Many of the fireproof floors are now constructed of concrete of various materials, either in the form of arches or with flat ceilings built in situ or in slabs ; the details of the various systems will be fully described in section 2. Although a certain material may withstand the action of fire satisfactorily, it is important to know what will be the effect upon it of water when in a heated state, for in a conflagration these two elements have to he contended with, and very often water causes the more disastrous effects. It may he mentioned that at the great fire at Lynn on Nov. 26, 1889, when buildings covering an area of 40 acres were destroyed, the water used would have flooded the whole space to a depth of over 7 feet, and at the great fire at Boston on Nov. 28th, 1889, sufficient water was poured upon the structures to cover the site to a depth of 2 feet 7 inches.

"To enable some idea to be formed of the action of fire and water upon various concretes, the author made a series of experiments on test briquettes of various mixture, as follows

"The briquettes were of the form usually adopted for testing cement, and the tests were made in a Bailey cement testing machine in the laboratory of University College, Liverpool, Prof. II. S. Hele Shaw, M. Inst. C. E., having kindly placed the use of the machine at the author's disposal. NOTE. -----As the stresses to which the various concretes are submitted in an actual structure are very similar to those met with in ordinary engineering works where cement is used, the author felt justified in only applying such a tensile test as is usually adopted in the case of cement.

Five briquettes of each set were tested at a normal temperature of about 6o Fahrenheit; the other five were carefully heated on the top of a specially built up fire of coal and coke until they were of a light red heat, the average time of exposure to the heat being about five minutes ; they were then removed, and whilst hot

were quenched with water. A large number of the briquettes lost all cohesive power after being quenched, and it was with difficulty that they were removed intact. As they could not in this state withstand any tensile strain, they were allowed to dry. After three days' exposure to the atmosphere of a warm room they partly

regained cohesion, and were then tested. The details of the tests are given in the appendix table I-X II, and the following is a summary of the results NOTE. The briquettes were set in air, and were tested within four or five weeks after being moulded.

"None of the above proportions are those adopted by the maker of any particular flooring, but they are such as to yield a good concrete tinder ordinary conditions, and are sufficient to enable an opinion to be formed of the strength of certain materials in combination, and of their value in fireproof construction."

The whole paper will well repay careful perusal, but your

space will not afford a longer extract. The subject

is one of great importance in all cities, and is deserving of careful study. When we build "fire-proof" let us seek to use sure material, and thus not bring discredit on ''tire-proofing." It would seem to be high time that, in the larger cities at least, fire-proof buildings be insisted on by the authorities.

Yours very truly
