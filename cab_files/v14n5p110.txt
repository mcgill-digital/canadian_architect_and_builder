LUXFER SUPPLEMENT





Luxfer Prisms.—The fact that any part of a building from basement to attic can be lighted by means of Luxfer Prisms is now well established. A tribute to the great success of the Luxfer device for lighting by daylight is evidenced by the efforts made to imitate. One by one these imitations have appeared on the market, with high sounding names, and by cutting prices hoped to obtain business. The first difficulty found by the imitator was in getting a product as effective as Luxfer the next difficulty the imitator found was that when he cut the price he did business at a loss. Even those now trying to sell ribbed plate as prisms are finding that their scheme does not succeed.



Prices.—In considering Luxfer Prisms it is only fair to compare the cost with a lighting plant and not with ordinary glass. Better manufacturing facilities and the result of experience has made it possible to install Prisms with more satisfaction and at less cost than formerly.



Electro-Glazed Art Glass. We have developed a new system of glazing which has proved a great success—the electrically deposited copper bar is neat and strong and where the heavy bar effect is not wanted, it surpasses any other system of glazing and is cheaper than other metallic bars.



Lead-glazed Art Glass. We also carry on lead glazing for church and domestic art glass work—good taste in selecting glasses and good mechanical work in glazing must result in a more satisfactory product. This has been attained without any increase of cost.



Staple and Ornamental Glasses.—We carry full lines of stock glass, including plate glass, sheet glass, skylight glass, wire glass and fancy colored glasses. Quick delivery at close prices is guaranteed.
