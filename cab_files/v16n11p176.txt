BUILDING CONDITIONS IN HAMILTON.



The following extract from a letter received from a Hamilton architect shows the unusual activity in building operations prevailing in that city this year: "There is more work on here than there are men to do it and the result is that work is dragging along very slowly, causing much complaint from clients and leading architects. Of late, on alteration work, I have not called for tenders, simply going to a few reliable men and getting the promise of the required workmen and then letting them go on with the work"



PRESERVING STONEWORK.

<article title=" PRESERVING STONEWORK " author="">

In a recent address at the Royal Academy in London Professor Church gave some valuable information regarding the use of baryta water for the preservation of frescoes and stonework against injurious atmospheric influences. Baryta water can be used with safety when twenty times stronger than lime water, and the sulphuric acid in London's atmosphere, though it destroys

The same wall of common brick 12" thick, would contain

3,000 cubic feet, which even at the exceedingly low estimate of



100 lbs. per cubic foot would give 300,000 lbs. for the weight of

wall, including the mortar.

EFFECTS OF CINDER CONCRETE ON IRON AND STEEL.

To the Editor, CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



MONTREAL, Oct. 18, 1903.



SIR,—Enclosed please find copy of a photograph recently taken of some work done about ten years ago and which is a good illustration of what cinder concrete will do to iron and steel after a certain length of time.



This occurred in a building to which an extension is now being built, and cinder concrete (fortunately) was only used under a fireplace situated exactly where this wall was taken down to

the lime in a fresco, forms in combination with baryta an insoluble and practically indestructible substance which preserves from harm the colors of the painting. Professor Church said that he had been using baryta with success in the Chapter House at Westminster, where the thirteenth-century stone-carving has practically been converted into gypsum by the action of the atmosphere. So bad was the state of this carving when Professor Church commenced his treatment that when touched portions would adhere to the fingers, and it was liable to be damaged even by the slightest touch with a feather brush. He thought, however, that the application of the baryta water had preserved the carvings from further deterioration.



NOTES.



The Royal Commission on monuments of Belgium, constituted in 1835, is charged with the preservation of ancient buildings. The Commission may schedule any building or monument, and the scheduled building cannot be touched without the consent of the Commission, even if it is in private ownership. In Belgium, as in France and Denmark, grants of public money are given for the purchase and preservation of ancient monuments, and the Belgian municipalities are very zealous in the same direction. In Bruges, we understand, the facades of all the houses belong to the municipality, so that their preservation is secured, and also congruity in the case of new buildings. No object of art may legally be alienated or removed from a Belgian church.
