TORONTO MASTER PLUMBERS AND STEAM FITTERS.

THE Master Plumbers' and Steam Fitters' Association, of Toronto, was organized in the year 1885, and although including only a portion of the employers in those trades, was a fairly successful organization. During the prolonged strike of the journeymen plumbers in i888 the Association became quite active, and embraced nearly every employing plumber in the city. Since that time, largely owing to the depression in building operations, interest in the Association has to some extent declined. An effort has therefore been made during the past winter by some of the members to infuse new life into it, which effort has been successful.

To promote good fellowship and bring the members into closer touch with one another, the idea of an annual banquet was conceived. The event took place on Thursday evening, the 26th Of March, and the success which attended it augurs well for the future of the Association. Shortly after eight o'clock the members and their friends, with business cast aside and wearing smiling countenances, put in an appearance at Webb's restaurant. Upwards of one hundred occupied seats at the table, among whom were many prominent plumbers of the city, representatives of the wholesale supply houses, civic representatives, and visitors from London.

As the jovial company took their seats around the festive board, there was no evidence to be seen of the hard times through which those connected with the building trades in Toronto have passed.
