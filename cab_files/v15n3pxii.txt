<article title=" UNITED STATES COMPETITION " author="">UNITED STATES COMPETITION.



The Canadian Manufacturers of Portland cement are taking concerted action with a view to endeavoring to induce municipalities to use only Canadian cement, and have also interviewed the Government to urge a readjustment of the duty. the rapidly increasing capacity of cement manufactories in the United States, and the consequent keenness of competition has resulted in directing the attention of these manufacturers to the Canadian market. Of late a large amount of cement from the United States has been sold in Canada at low prices. The manufacturers here claim that the capacity of the Canadian mills is now about 1,000,000 barrels per annum, and that this quantity is sufficient to supply the home demand. We notice that the city of Hamilton, to which an appeal was made to use only Canadian cement, accepted the tender of a United States firm which was the lowest submitted. This no doubt indicates the course which is likely to be pursued by municipalities generally. The only hope of relief to the manufacturers, therefore would seem to be from a readjustment of the duties. In connection with this it may be said that manufacturers in other lnes are feeling keenly the effect

of competition from the United States, and a thorough revision of the tariff, at an early date. would seem to be desirable. If United States manufacturers desire to share in the benefits of Canadian business, they should as far as possible, be compelled to produce their goods in this country. Even under the present moderate tariff many United States manufacturers are finding it to their advantage to establish branches in this country, and if our tariff was carefully revised and readjusted, many more would establish themselves here, thereby increasing the opportunity for employment and adding to the national wealth.
