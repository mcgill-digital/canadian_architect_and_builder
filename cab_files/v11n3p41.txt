FOR several years prior to the first A Hopeful Sign. of January last there was a decrease

each month in number and value of real estate transactions, as shown by the Toronto Registry office records. It is reported, however, that the first two months of this year show an increase in the volume of transactions.



THE scarcity of timber in Great Britain

Building

	Materials,	is clearly shown by comparing the ex-

		tent to which wood is there employed



with the quantity used in the United States. The annual consumption in England is placed at only 18 cubic feet per capita, while in the States it is about 350 cubic feet. The introduction of iron and steel in building construction has, however, already greatly lessened the use of wood for this purpose in the large cities of the United States, and is destined to restrict its employment to a much greater extent in the future. The change is opportune, in view of the growing scarcity and costliness of white pine and other choice varieties of building timber.



FOLLOWING close in the train of the Another Building recent building disaster at London,

Disaster.

Ont., with its terrible consequences,

comes the news of the collapse on Feb. 21st of the roof of a large music hall at Oshawa, Ont. The building is described as a three-story brick structure, with a large assembly hail on the upper floor. It was covered by a flat roof about 75 x 100 feet in size, which fell to the second floor, completely covering the seats in the music hall. The accident occurred at five o'clock in the morning. To this fortunate circumstance is due the fact that a number of lives were not sacrificed. On the preceding Saturday evening a large political meeting was held in the building, and on the evening of the day on which the accident took place an entertainment was to have been given at which it was estimated there would have been present 8oo persons. How terrible, therefore, would have been the consequences had the accident been delayed but a few hours ! Doubtless the immediate cause of the collapse was accumulation of snow on the roof, but the fact that the roof was a new one and that the building had recently undergone changes and repairs, at a cost of about $5,000, is sufficient
