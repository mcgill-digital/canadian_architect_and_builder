 AMERICAN SUBSTITUTE FOR SANDPAPER.

<article title=" AMERICAN SUBSTITUTE FOR SANDPAPER " author="">

Steel wool, introduced five or six years ago, is a machine-produced material that is used as a substitute for sandpaper. it is composed of sharp-edged threads of steel, which curl up together like wool, or somewhat as the wood fibres of the familiar material known as excelsior curl up together, though the steel wool is very much liner, the finest of it being not much coarser than the coarsest St. of natural wools. The steel wool is put up in packages containing lb. each. These are something like rolls of cotton batting but smaller 1 lb. of steel wool, loosely packed, ma king, rolled in paper and open at the ends, a package perhaps 15 in. long and 'in or 3 in. in diameter.

Made in various degrees of coarseness, steel wool is put o a variety of uses the finer wools for polishing wood and metal

and the coarser for rubbing down paint and varnish. It is often used on special

parts of work. While, for example, on the flat surface of a door a man would use sandpaper with a block back for it, for the mouldings he would use steel wool, which fits into the crevices and conforms into irregular shapes. Such work can be done with steel wool far more readily and quickly than with sandpaper and it is used with this advantage of irregular and small surfaces and on carved work.

Besides the steel wool there is coarser material of the same kind called steel shavings, which is put to various uses as in taking off old paint or varnish, and in polishing wood before painting, and it is used on bowling alleys and on floors for smoothing and cleaning them. Sandpaper clogs in use steel wool breaks down. The wool is commonly used with gloves to keep the ends from sticking into the fingers.— Woodworker
