EFFECT OF AMERICAN DRAINAGE WORKS ON

CANADIAN INTERESTS.

Quebec March 3rd, 1895.

Editor CANADIAN Architect AND Builder



SIR, When I wrote you in January last, as to my surprise that our Dominion Parliament had allowed a franchise to he given by Congress without its consent, to rob our Canadian head waters of some 3 1/2 per cent. to supplement the requirements of the Chicago drainage works on their way towards the Gulf of Mexico, I did not think that our winking at such a thing would embolden another company to so soon petition the United States Senate for an act of incorporation, with a $100,000,000 capital, to again tap the lakes in one or more than one point for commercial purposes, running towards the Hudson and New York en route for the Atlantic 

Such, however, is the case. The bill is before the U. S. Senate, and will of course go through like the Chicago bill, if no stand be taken against its becoming law.

I showed how the present capacity of the Chicago outflow towards the Mississippi is, or will be, when the drainage works are completed in 1896 not less than 1-30 01 3 1/3 per cent. of the feed waters of the St. Lawrence, and how this percentage may in a few years be increased to 10 if Chicago continues to grow as it has done during the past few years.

Now each of the proposed canals of the "<assoc>American Maritime Canal Co.</assoc>may take, not only 10 per cent. or twenty, of our waters, but even thirty, and three stitch tapings would suffice to withdraw the whole of the water at present flowing over Niagara from Erie to Ontario— reducing the St. Lawrence below Niagara to the drainage of the valley of the Ontario and the water brought down by the Ottawa, the St. Maurice and other tributaries.



lt. may be, sir, that, as interested in Quebec, I am cutting my own throat in calling attention to this matter, as the less the flow the less the depth in Lake St. Peter, the better the excuse for ocean vessels not going to Montreal, and remaining here where we have the advantage of tide waters to cover the deficiency twice in every twenty-four hours but, sir, I take a broader view of this matter, and look to the interests of Canada in general, of the Dominion at large, and I can conceive nothing more cool than for our neighbors beyond the line of 49 thus to attempt to rob us of our God-given patrimony, with our engineers, our legislature looking on in titter indifference to an act of spoliation which certainly has no parallel among civilized nations.

<article title="Correspondence – Departmental Store Buildings" author="">DEPARTMENTAL STORE BUILDINGS. Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND Builder



SIR,—The attempts which are being made to stein the tide of modern progress in the direction of large departmental stores will be in vain, but in one way these stores as built or altered become a menace to the safety of the surrounding community, which should not be tolerated, and which it is in the power of the community to control.

Owing to the extensive floor areas demanded for attractive display or for easy supervision, and the heaps of inflammable goods and fixtures, they are peculiarly liable to a sort of galloping consumption which seems to he epidemic in Toronto this winter 

The destruction of the new <building>Simpson building </building>and the attendant losses to surrounding owners, besides the expense to the city generally, is not only to he lamented, but becomes an outrage that ought to be resented, because unnecessary and preventable.

In all municipal building regulations the danger of large undivided floor areas is recognized and prohibited. Our own building by-laws require brick party walls at certain distances, limiting the floor areas, but these commercial barons do not readily submit to stitch wholesome restriction. They build or alter their airy castles to suit their own ideas of trade,

their helpless neighbors, including the municipal burghers, meekly submitting just as to the warlike barons of old.

Now in no other class of buildings should these regulations be more strictly enforced. Let there be frequent party walls running from basement to roof, though having ample openings for display and circulation, readily closed by sliding or rolling fireproof doors. This need be no hardship, and trade would easily accommodate itself to stitch a requirement. Besides this, no building above the reach of water by the ordinary appliances should be permitted, unless fire-proof or fire-resisting throughout. The slight additional cost would he little enough penalty for erecting such tasteless structures, so unsymmetrical, in our streets, and so damaging to their more modest competitors.

The Simpson building was the best representative of its class in the city, a style of temple expressly designed to meet the demands of the modern mammon worshipper— the greatest display in the slenderest building. The architect deserves credit for the triumph obtained for his employer— a strong building with the minimum of space occupied by supports, and faultless in exterior detail.

But such a building is neither fire-proof nor fire-resisting it assists the spread of the flames, it is dangerous to firemen to inmates and to surrounding property. The new building was not only an unbroken space, but the walls of the older portions were removed to extend the view What happened here is most likely to happen at different points in the city. Such a fire may prove a great advertisement to the large store, but no such good luck to the neighboring small fry, who are more likely to he injured by its competition and ruined by its destruction.

In all probability the phoenix will rise, a greater menace than before. If there were no remedy there might be some virtue in a calm resignation or even if there were only the expensive method of fire-proofing, the choice of the cheaper method might be excusable. But there are a number of building methods, inexpensive, yet far superior to that now becoming so popular. The party wall of the <building>Buntin Reid building</building>, in stopping our second great fire, gave proof of its utility and economy. Floors and roofs might quite easily be made fire-proof at a moderate cost in more than one manner.

For the present a hint only is thrown of it, but in a later issue may be given some description, showing that we need not suffer so extensively from fire if we choose to resist it.

Yours &c.,
