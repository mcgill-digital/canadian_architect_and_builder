The Outlook on Mount Royal, though not so far advanced as to permit one to judge perfectly of the effect, has at least got so far that it will in all probability he completed before winter sets in. It is satisfactory to think that this matter, which was taken up and let drop in a vacillating way during so many years, was at last brought to a definite result through the action of the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc>, who registered their appeal with the city authorities to have such matters put in the hands of men of professional training and experience. This simple proceeding on the part of the association was taken in such good part and acted on so readily by the authorities that one can only hope that the Association will continue to keep its eye on all similar affairs in future, and will he supported therein by all its members and by the public at large.
