SEVERAL of the largest manufacturers of lime in Toronto, Milton and Guelph have consolidated their interests, and will hereafter be known as the <assoc>Ontario Lime Association</assoc>. Toronto will be the headquarters of the Association. An effort will no doubt be made to stiffen prices.





THE <assoc>Association of Provincial Land Surveyors of Ontario </assoc>are applying to the Legislature for incorporation. For some reason or other the Bill which has been introduced with this object has met with considerable opposition. The influence of this opposition seems likely to also stand in the way of the required amendments to the Ontario Architects' Act.

	A CORRESPONDENT writes	"Allow me to congratulate you



on the editorial article on cement testing in February issue of CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER. I for one would be very glad to see your ideas regarding the establishing of a Government laboratory for testing cements carried out. Should occasion require It, you are at liberty to use my name as having been one of the sufferers. I can fully corroborate the statements contained in your article."





<person>Col. Tracy</person>, City Engineer of Vancouver, B. C., advises us that it is the purpose of the council of that city during the approaching summer to commence the use of bituminous rock pavement. This material which will be imported from Southern California, is described as being a good deal like asphalt, with the exception of being elastic, giving a good foothold to horses. Our informant regards it as being almost an ideal pavement. The success of this material will be watched with interest by other cities.



A	CORRESPONDENT writes from British Columbia concerning <building>Christ Church Cathedral Victoria </building>competition, Victoria, B.C., as follows

All designs received at this end are being forwarded unopened to the <building>Church House, Westminster,</building> Eng., where those prepared by English architects will be received. They will then be  examined by <person>CatIon Beaulands </person>and Mr. <person>B. Ferry</person>, architect, and the ten most suitable designs will be submitted to <person>Sir A. W. Blomfield</person>, whose decision as to the merit and award of prizes will be accepted by the plans committee. Some local architects have competed, but we believe many others have held aloof, not altogether liking the conditions of competition."





BUILDING operations in Montreal promise It) be somewhat extensive during the approaching summer. Strong efforts have been made for a year past by certain real estate speculators to boom suburban propel-ties, and in spite of the experience of Toronto, the older and more conservative city has shown itself to be susceptible to the boomster's art. It is unlikely, however, that speculation in land or building will be carried to anything like the pitch attained in Toronto during the recent period- of inflation. While anything bearing the least resemblance to wild-cat speculation ought to be severely discouraged, every possible encouragement should be afforded to legitimate building enterprises.





THE Ontario Association of Architects will hold the first examinations under the Act of Incorporation at the School of Practical Science, Toronto, on the 5th, 6th, 7th and 8th or next month. Three examinations will be held at the same time, the first and second intermediates and the final, and there are some sixty candidates coming forward to undergo the tests of their proficiency in the various stages. The Board of Examiners

consists of seven members		<person>Prof. Galbraith</person>, chairman, anti

Messrs. <person>C. H C Wright</person>, <person>E. Burke</person>, <person>R. W. Gambier-Bousfield</person>, S. G. Curry, <person>F. Darling </person>and S. H. Townsend. This is the first of a long series of examinations, let us hope the result of which will be that the danger the public are now in, of falling into the hands of unskilled practitioners, will in time be done away with. Now a youth must perforce go through a regular course of training, passing examinations at certain stages to lest his progress and show him in what particulars he is weak, until having passed the final examination, he may practice his profession with honor to himself and for the good of the public.
