A CENSUS Bulletin recently issued by the Dominion Government shows that the workers in wood in the Dominion number 78,604; in stone, 30,836; in wood and stone combined, 10,201;

and in metals, 49,476. The number of carpenters and joiners is 45,760 stone masons, 10,312; and painters and glaziers, 10,202.





THE evening classes in connection with the Toronto Technical School were resumed a fortnight ago. The attendance on the opening night was very large, and advantage is being taken to so great an extent of the instruction offered that the need of more commodious quarters is one with which the building management will be confronted at an early date. The success which has attended the founding of this school is most gratifying to the advocates of technical instruction for the artisan classes.



THE annual report of the Ontario Bureau of Mines Shows that there was produced in this province during the last year, common brick to the value of $980,000; plain pressed brick, $198,350; fancy pressed brick, $32,253; drain tile, $100,000. The value of stone quarried reaches $880,000. Cement to the value of $86, 000 was placed on the market. The production of lime is valued at $350,000. Of a total mineral production of $5,374,000, $2,526,603 consisted of materials for use ID architectural and engineering works.



IN view of the great scarcity of black walnut, once so plentiful in Canada, Mr. Joly has proposed to the farmers of Quebec that they should cultivate the walnut tree, as has been done in some of the Western States. The nuts after being left out all winter in heaps, covered with earth and straw, are in the spring planted two inches below the surface of the ground. The walnut tree is said to have a rapid growth. Mr. Joly's suggestion seems to be a valuable one, and we hope will receive the attention of the Forestry Department of the Government.



A French blacksmith named Ferdinand Allard, residing at Levis, Que., is said to have discovered a process of tempering copper. A small cannon tempered by his process is said to have been loaded to the muzzle with the most powerful powder driven in with a sledge and exploded without causing the least expansion of the barrel. A plate of copper three-eighths of an inch thick showed only slight indentation from the impact of rifle bullets fixed at forty yards distance with a force of two thousand pounds, while a hardened steel plate two inches thick was shattered to pieces from the same cause. The inventor of the process is confident that the most powerful projectile could not penetrate a ship the sides of which were protected with a 14-inch plate of copper which had been thus tempered.



 IF we may judge by the published reports, the city of Winnipeg has become rid of the incubus imposed on her progress by the wild-cat speculation which a few years ago ran riot in that city. To all appearances the city has entered on a period of rapid and healthy development. The volume of building operations during the present year is stated to be about $1,884,450. This is as nearly as possible double in extent those of 1892, the aggregate of which was $900,000. The buildings erected this year consist largely of residences, for occupation by the owners. There is said to be a steady demand also for houses for renting purposes. The character of the residences built this year is said to be greatly superior to that of buildings of the same class formerly erected. There is said to be much demand for a better class of buildings for business purposes, and to meet
