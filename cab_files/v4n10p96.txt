<doctype type="text">96 THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER October, 1891



<person>PROF. BOVEY</person>.

PROF. <person>Henry Taylor Bovey </person>was educated at a private school in England, and at Cambridge University. On entering the University he competed for and obtained an open scholarship. On graduation he took a high place in the mathematical tripos, and shortly after was made a fellow of Queen's College. Having decided to adopt the profession of engineering, he joined the staff of the <firm>Mersey Docks and Harbour Works</firm>. He was shortly appointed one of the assistant engineers on this work, and in this capacity had charge of some of the important works then in progress.

In 1877 he was appointed Professor of Civil Engineering and Applied Mechanics in McGill University, Montreal. The engineering courses in the University were at that time managed as a department of the Faculty of Arts and were without buildings or equipment. In 1878, however, a department of Applied Science was constituted, and Prof. Bovey was elected its Dean. The magnificent endowment of the late Mr. <person>Thomas Workman </person>anti Mr. <person>W. C. McDonald </person>have afforded Dean Bovey an opportunity for the display of his great executive ability and untiring energy.

Much of the success of the <assoc>Canadian Society of Civil Engineers </assoc>is without doubt due to Prof. Bovey's labours as its Secretary, which position he occupied continuously from the foundation of the Society until within the past

few months, when increasing college duties compelled him to resign the office. Prof. Bovey is a Fellow of the <assoc>Royal Society of Canada</assoc>, a member of the <assoc>Institution of Civil Engineers</assoc>, as well as of several other engineering societies.

IT is a singular fact," said a well known Toronto plumber to me the other day, "that not one builder in twenty appears to know what the proper dimensions are for stationary wash tubs. It is still more singular that they are continually applying to me for the information. One would suppose a carpenter would know more about the matter than a plumber. In order to be in a position to answer my numerous enquirers on this subject. however, I have jotted the information down in my note book, and here it is: Inside measurementsâ€”15 inches across bottom, 23 inches across top, 15 1/2 in. deep and 25 in. in length for each compartment. Thinking that possibly the information might be of service to many readers of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER I give it

for publication, trusting also that by doing so I shall assist my friend, the plumber, to save a portion of his valuable time.

Builders and others intent upon disregarding the law which compels a permit to be obtained previous to the erection of any new buildings, occasionally get an opportunity to laugh at the expense of the Building Inspector. Such an individual made application at the Inspector's office the other day for a permit to erect a dwelling, and having obtained it, turned round and coolly informed the official that he had just completed the house and moved his family into it.

1 wonder how many of our city architects are thoroughly familiar with the provisions of the local building ordinance? A member of a leading architectural firm learned for the first time the other day, of the existence of a provision in the local by-law prohibiting the use of certain materials in partition walls, notwithstanding that the by-law has been in operation for two years. Architects will save themselves and their clients time and expense by acquainting themselves with the details of the regulations governing the construction of buildings.



Apropos of your editorial remarks on the growth of incandescent electric lighting in Toronto, a prominent official of the <firm>C.P.R. Telegraph Company </firm>directed my attention a few days ago to a new business building in course of erection on a leading thoroughfare. Do you know," said he, that there isn't a gas pipe to be found in that building? It is, as you see, wired throughout for electric lights. The intention is to depend entirely upon the incandescent light. I regard this as a striking illustration of the rapid

strides which the electric light is making. Two years ago, no architect or owner of a building would for a moment have considered the question of dispensing with gas."



A Montreal architect remarked to me the other day that architectural students in Quebec are at a disadvantage as compared with students in Ontario. Being asked in what particular, he pointed to the use of the dual languages as being one serious drawback and also to the fact that well equipped free public libraries, such as the one in Toronto, are not at the disposal of the students of Quebec. There is no doubt some foundation for this view of the case, and consequently the greater reason to hope that the Quebec Association of Architects will exert itself to the utmost during the approaching winter to provide such instruction for the students as shall, to a large extent at least, make up to them the loss sustained in the direction referred to. The students should scarcely need to be reminded that upon the extent of their own efforts will most depend their advancement.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



A MEETING of the Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>and students of architecture was held in the rooms of the Association on the 5th inst. Mr. F, X. Berlinquet presided. The principal business before the meeting was to make arrangements for the instruction of the students during the coming winter. Messrs. <person>Taylor</person>, <person>Raza</person>, <person>Hutchison</person> and <person>Dunlop</person> were appointed a Committee to arrange a program, which should

include a series of lectures, and if possible, classes in architecture. The success of the undertaking will depend largely upon the students themselves. If they show their appreciation of the efforts which the Association is making for their benefit, by being present at the lectures and classes whenever it is possible for them to do so, satisfactory results are certain to follow.

A strong feeling seems to exist here in favor of <assoc>a Dominion Association of Architects</assoc>, and it is not improbable that at the next meeting of the Ontario Association a deputation from this province will be on hand to confer with the members concerning this most important subject.

<person>Mr. Hadrill</person>, the Secretary, reports that upwards of $175,000 has been subscribed for the erection of the <building>new Board of Trade building</building>. It is expected that the full amount required will be secured shortly. and that construction will begin early in the spring.

The practice of proceeding with the erection of buildings without complying with the by-law which provides that a permit must first be obtained from the office of the inspector of Buildings, prevails largely in this city, as in the cities of Toronto, Hamilton and elsewhere. During the past week this practice of violating the law led directly to the death of a workman named <person>Theodore Pouliot</person>, employed on a building in course of erection by a contractor named <person>Elzear Chenet</person>, at 116 Desrivieres street. Chenet drew the plans for the building himself, and went on with construction without a permit. One side was constructed of planks three inches thick, laid horizontally one above the other and tongued and grooved, supported only by a post at each end. Under the weight of the last storey this wall bulged out at the center near the foundations, and the structure collapsed, killing Pouliot as stated. <person>Mr. Lacroix</person>, the Inspector, testified at the inquest that owing to a detect in the by-law persons intending to build were not required to submit plans of the proposed building, but only a general description, and that while Chenet should have notified him three days before the foundations were commenced, he did not do so until two days after the roof was

on.	It was shown that the contractor had obtained a blank form which he should have filled in and returned to the Inspector's office before proceeding with the work, but which he did not so return. Because this form was not handed in, the Inspector concluded that work had not been commenced, 'I he jury brought in the following verdict: 'We find that the collapse of the house No 116 Desrivieres street on Friday evening was due to bad workmanship and the want of experience on the part of the contractor, Elzear Chenet; moreover, we censure the Building Inspector for having given permits without knowing it the building had been started or not." Is it not time that a severe example was made of those who willfully disregard the city building ordinance? It is also clearly desirable that all persons proposing to build should be compelled to submit plans for the approval of the inspector of Buildings.

The Roads Department has expended thus far $355,371, out of a total appropriation of $406,642, leaving a balance in hand of $51,271. In addition there have been large expenditures for permanent pavements, the funds for which have been secured by special loan.
