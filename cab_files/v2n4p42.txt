<doctype type="text">an Architectural Association, but for reasons which he need not enumerate the undertaking proved a failure. There was no doubt that hitherto the profession had been too Ishmaelitish in its character. If the architects would in future stand by each other they would receive the treatment accorded to members of other professions. He would not deprecate honest criticism among architects, which was a different thing from the underrating spirit too often met with. There was no necessity for the indulgence of such a spirit, as owing to the growth of the country, there was plenty of room for all. Referring to the question of incorporation, the speaker said a standard of education, and the means of getting such a standard, was first necessary. In his efforts to establish in the city of Toronto a chair of architecture, the Minister of Education had the sympathy of all architects.

Mr. Curry, secretary of the Guild, read letters of apology at their inability to be present, from the Hon. the Minister of Education, His Worship the Mayor of Toronto, Messrs. <person>Alan Macdougall</person>, Toronto; <person>Fuller</person>, Government architect, Ottawa; <person>Stewart</person>, Hamilton <person>Adams</person>, Kingston; <person>Day</person>, Guelph; <person>Post</person>, <person>Grist, </person>Ottawa; and <person>Jones, </person>London.

The chairman proposed the toast, Our Professional Guests," coupled with the names of Messrs. <person>King Arnoldi</person>, <person>Balfour</person> and <person>Durand.</person>

Mr. Balfour said the architects had themselves to blame for the lack of proper recognition by the public. He thanked the Architectural Guild for having brought the present meeting together. The fight for their rights on the part of the architects must be done now or later on, and in his opinion it had better be done now.

Mr. Durand was surprised and highly gratified at the successful commencement which had been made. The result must be to raise the status of the profession throughout the Province. He could ask no higher honor than the Association had conferred upon him in electing him as one of its vice-presidents. Every member should work for incorporation and twelve months hence he hoped the Association would be in a position to ask for incorporation.

Mr. Alexander, in the absence of Mr. Arnoldi, referred to the success which had thus far attended the formation of the <assoc>Ottawa Institute of Architects</assoc>, and the benefits which would result to the profession and the public if incorporation were obtained. He hoped to see the movement succeed.

In calling upon <person>Prof. Galbraith </person>to respond for the cause of technical education, the chairman referred to the value of such instruction to the student of architecture, who, in the practice of the profession, had so much to do with mechanics. The architect was supposed to teach half a dozen different trades, and hitherto had been obliged to pick up as best he could the practical knowledge pertaining to them.

Prof. Galbraith remarked that architects and engineers stood in much the same relation to technical education. The students of the present day in these professions who hope to succeed must have technical education. Technical schools could not make of a student a perfect professional. They should enable him to read and understand scientific books. The practical part of his education should be learned in the and by actual practice. In the case of architectural students there was also to be considered the question of artistic education, which was quite as important as the other. He did not feel competent to express an opinion as to how a knowledge of art should be taught in schools, though a certain amount of art training could and should be got in school. The ultimate measure of a student's success must depend upon his adaptability for the profession he seeks to enter. The formation of this <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>marked a new era in the architectural history of this country. It should be the duty of the Association to endeavor to secure a standard of qualification for the practice of the profession.

The vice-chairman, <person>W. G. Storm</person>, spoke of the joy which the work so successfully accomplished that day had given him. He believed the Ontario Association of Architects contained as good metal as any similar organization on this continent.

Mr. <person>F. J. Rastrick </person>said the profession in Canada had hitherto been lacking in the feeling of brotherhood which should obtain amongst members of such a noble profession. He congratulated the architects present upon the good day's work that had been accomplished.

Mr. Burke pointed out that the success of the association would depend upon every member maintaining a proper standard of ethics. This standard of ethics was briefly comprehended in the golden rule Do unto others as you would they should do unto you."

Mr. <person>Gordon</person> referred to the effect of the architect's work upon the education of the public, and urged the study of the ancient architectural history and the best models of Greek and Gothic architecture, in order that their work might have an ennobling effect.

The toast to "The <assoc>Architectural Guild of Toronto</assoc>," was received with great enthusiasm and was responded to by Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>.

At intervals during the evening the proceedings were enlivened by songs from Messrs. Mulligan and Denison.





The annexation of Parkdale to the city of Toronto will compel the city to appoint a third inspector of plumbing. It is a well-known fact to those acquainted with the subject that even three inspectors will not be sufficient to insure the proper performance of the work. We would suggest the appointment of two new inspectors.

 ONE of the first official acts of the Board of Directors of the Ontario Association of Architects, was to instruct the Secretary to recommend members of the Association to abstain from entering the proposed competition for the Kent and Chatham Public Buildings. Objection is taken to the conditions of the competition on the following grounds (I). There is no guarantee that a competent professional adviser will be employed to report upon the merits of the respective designs; (2). The commission proposed to be paid for carrying out the work is below the recognized professional tariff; (3). The drawings for which premiums are awarded are to become the property of the committee; (4). Much more detail is required in the preparation of the drawings than is at all necessary to properly illustrate the proposed building.

By SIR DANIEL WILSON LL.D.

N building a legislative hall, a court of justice, a university convocation hall, or any other structure designed for special use, it is demanded of the constructor that it shall be so adapted to its requirements, that all shall, as far as possible, see, hear and in all other needful respects find no obstruction to the work carried on therein. Is there any reason why the same rule should not apply to church building?

The exquisite beauty of the cathedrals of older centuries charms every thoughtful observer; and the picturesque little parish church of the village or hamlet is a delightful feature in the landscape, whenever the tourist wanders through the mother land. But the old architects never lost sight of practical utility.

The long-drawn aisles, transepts, and chantry chapels, were not erected as mere ornaments to the cathedrals and collegiate churches of Roman Catholic countries; and were accordingly erected with a thorough aim at utility, This the great English architect, Sir <person>Christopher Wren, </person>thoroughly appreciated when he undertook the design for the new <building>St. Paul's Cathedral</building>. He set before his mind the essential requirements of Protestant worship, and accordingly designed a cathedral adapted to accommodate a large body of worshippers who should be able to see, hear, and unite in the worship in accordance with the manifest purpose of the Book of Common Prayer. The original design of the great architect for a model Protestant Cathedral was cast aside, just because the Stuart king had no sympathy with Protestant worship.

Without any such reason, our own church builders have so habitually followed the models derived from mediaeval times, that the majority of our churches are still built in the form of a long parallelogram with rows of pillars dividing them into centre and side aisles. To this is frequently added a long, narrow chancel, with the result that, wherever the pulpit may be placed, fully a third of the congregation can neither see nor hear satisfactorily; and when portions of the service are read at the communion table, within the deep recess of the choir, or the regular announcements are made, they are inaudible to the larger por-
