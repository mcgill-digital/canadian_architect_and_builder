<article title=" Putting in Foundations In Winter " author="">Putting in Foundations In Winter For several years in Toronto there has been but a very short gap between one building 

season and another. In fact, if account is taken of the new structures on which inside work is in progress throughout the winter, there may be said to be no gap at all. The present winter, which has been a favorable one for architects and builders, witnessed the putting in of foundations for new buildings during January and the early part of February. The method adopted to prevent frost from getting in below the foundations is to cover the work when not in process of construction, with manure. It is admitted, however, that there is considerable risk attending the practice—the success of which largely depends on securing a week or ten days of favorable weather. We have been told of instances in which frost having got below the footings of a cellar pier, caused the architect trouble from settlement throughout the whole progress of the work.



<article title=" Building Failures " author="">Building Failures The Montreal papers have already recorded this year several

instances in which buildings in that city have collapsed. Such cases have been altogether too frequent in Montreal during the last three or four years. In some instances, as in the case of a biscuit factory on Delorimer Avenue last month, the collapse came while the building was in process of construction. In others, the buildings had been standing for years, and probably succumbed to strains imposed on them which they were never intended to bear. In the case of the uncompleted buildings the explanation is not so clear. Their collapse would seem to be due either to faulty materials or construction or to carelessness on the part of contractors in failing to properly support the unfinished walls. Whatever the cause, greater care should be exercised lest human life be sacrificed, which through good fortune rather than good management, has not yet occurred.



An inspection of a batch of

for a better all-round education and in particular a better business training, for contractors. It is evident that many contractors do not study and grasp the meaning of the specifications on which their tenders are based. The specifications may in the most explicit manner require the contractor to state what deductions in price he will make if certain parts of the work are omitted, but as a rule he pays to attention whatever to the requirement and it is impossible for the architect to know whether his tender is designed to
