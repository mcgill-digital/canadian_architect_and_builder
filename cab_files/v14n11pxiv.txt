IF YOU WANT THE BEST

Warm Air Furnace or Combination Heater obtainable anywhere, then your choice must be the





Peace "Economy"

These Heaters arc not made to sell at a lower price than any other apparatus in the market. The sole aim of the manufacturers is to make them Better than Any Other. It is true that there are light-weight Furnaces in the market that are sold at a lower price, but the slight difference in price is out of all proportion when worth is considered.
