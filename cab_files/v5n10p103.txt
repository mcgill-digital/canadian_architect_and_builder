change will be able to show what the builders can do in the way of benefitting themselves, and also the architects, as our interests are practically one. It is a difficult thing to say just what could be done to promote the best of feeling between the architects and the builders, but something should be done to place things in a better position than they now are. It cannot be considered satisfactory when builders are competing to obtain work at rates which will simply give them day's wages at the best ; that is the condition of things at the present time. At the same time it is a very difficult thing to say what would be satisfactory to all parties. Certain of the builders propose certain remedies; nothing could be accomplished without the builders being unanimous on this question. You must learn to have confidence one in another. If you can cultivate confidence, it will place you on the road to secure the needed remedies. I think the architects will do all in their power to assist you. Of course the architects do not care to interfere in matters not considered their own. Sometimes the trade unions undertake to dictate to the architects what they should do. I am not at all opposed to trade unions myself in any sense. I don't believe there are any of us who are desirous of having our work done for less than will maintain a man in comfort. It would be very unjust to get work done at a price which would insure but a bare existence. We can surely make more than a mere existence. Now, I hope this Exchange will result in the builders coming together and talking the matter over, and having greater confidence in each other, and arrange matters so that in future this unreasonable competition will not go on, although it seems to be the principle of the present day that everything must be cut down, to the detriment of the great majority, while the few reap the benefit. There are many points to be considered as between the architects and builders. In this matter of tendering, say a builder puts in a tender, and his tender is the lowest an architect has to consider all tenders thoroughly, and he will accept the tender that is most judicious in the interest of the proprietor and the contractors. Then the builder who has put in the lowest tender thinks he is being played upon, and gets indignant. Now, it comes in as between the architects and builders very often that the contractors are trying to get the work done with as little work as possible, and the architect with as much as possible. I have been told that it was my duty to get all I could out of the contractors The contractor. I think, should tender to do the work at such a figure as will allow him to perform the work to the thorough satisfaction of the architect. I think one of the great faults of the present day is that specifications are more or less useless. They are drawn up by the architect in rigmarole style There has got to be a specification of some sort or other. An architect is not infallible ; he cannot know everything. It is this question of inferior specifications which causes a great deal of dissatisfaction. If the architect knew just w hat class of work a proprietor wanted or about what he wanted to expend. there would be less friction in these matters. Now, I think it would be in the interests of the members of this Exchange to try if some means could not be adopted whereby a reasonable profit could be got for work done. If you find an architect is unreasonable in the manner of work to be done, you need not take work from his office. I think it would be well to drop out of that architect's office; that is the only way to put things straight. If the architect is unreasonable and unjust, why do not go near him. At the present time it is a very difficult thing to try and raise prices ; everyone wants work ; they must have work often, and they attempt to get it at a very low figure Something should be done to improve the present condition. I think combines useless.

Mr. <person>W. J. Hill</person>, the President of the Exchange replied as follows "On behalf of the Exchange I have to thank you for the hearty manner in which you have drank the toast of the Builders' Exchange Away back in the early sixties, the first builders' association was organized in the city of Toronto. From that time until February last the organization assumed various shapes. After considerable talk last winter certain members prominent in connection with the builders' section decided to write to the United States for information necessary to the establishment of a Building Exchange and as to what basis they were run on in the United States. Soon after application was made to the Ontario Government for an Act of Incorporation. The <assoc>Builders' Exchange </assoc>was formed for the purpose of providing valuable business information to its members Immediately after we obtained our charter in February last, we enrolled 37 members, and from February up to the present we have issued certificates to 137 members. We have formed Sections known as the "Stone Cutters Section""Builders' Laborers Section" and the "Carpenters' Section." The Plumbers' Section" will likely be formed inside of the next week or so. The felt and slate roofers intend to form a section soon. A short time ago we decided that our rooms were too small , we hadn't the accommodation for meetings that we required. so we set about making arrangements for new quarters. We have agreements with the Masons' Section and the Stone Cutters' Section. I want to say to our members to-night, stick to your agreements. There has been a little friction in one quarter but this has blown over. We have a Board of Arbitration in connection with our Exchange to settle disputes. There are a few questions as between architects and the builders that might be put on a better footing. I am satisfied that the outcome of this meeting will be the issuing of

a few more certificates. I invite <person>Mr. Smith </person>and every member of the architects' association to our rooms at any time. You will find some of us there always We intend to make this our place of business. Members of the Exchange gather here in the mornings, and transact general business here. I have again to thank you heartily for the manner in which you have responded to the toast of the Builders' Exchange."

The Vice-President, Mr. <person>Geo. Moir</person>, in replying to the toast said "I think the President knew very well that the time was short, and he also knew that I hadn't very much to say ; and what little there was required to be said he took care to say himself. He has covered the whole ground most carefully. I can only endorse every word he has said in regard to the cordial relations which ought to exist between the architects and builders generally. I think we are all in the same boat. It is all very well to say that architects are with the proprietors all the time—I don't think this is the case.

Mr. <person>Henry Simpson </person>then favored the company with an exhibition of ventriloquism which occasioned great amusement. Many were the jokes got off at the expense of some of the members.

Mr. <person>Harry Rich </person>sang 'Two Sweathearts" in capital style, and again had to reply to an encore. His encore number was "You Grow More like your Dad Every Day," which made a great hit.

The next feature of the programme was a short entertainment by Mr. <person>George Oakley</person>, illustrative of an Irishman's boyhood days on the farm. His impersonations of the cattle in the far m yard were very realistic.

The toast of "The Ladies," proposed by the President, brought forth a happy response on behalf of the fair sex from Mr. Elliott.

The company dispersed shortly after midnight with the feeling that they had spent an evening of solid enjoyment and profit.





<article title="Woodwork in art" author="">WOODWORK IN ART.

I see it stated that Ken Natter, the distinguished Austrian sculptor who recently died in Vienna, was in his youth a woodcarver, and by the practice of his humble craft rose to eminence in the highest of the plastic arts. Now, not a few of the best known artists of this country have served a similar apprenticeship. Sir <person>Francis Chantrey</person>, who died with a hundred thousand pounds, rose from the carving of ship's figure heads, through second-class portrait painting, to quarry in the gold mine of his very respectable, if not transcendent talents. The first serious efforts in art of <person>Prof. Herkomer </person>and of Mr. <person>Seymour Lucas </person>were made with the gouge and chisel on a block of wood. <person>James Burnet</person>, too, practised as a woodcarver, and Opie professed the baser craft of a carpenter, and Romney of a cabinet maker. It is only another illustration of the truth that to the real artist the medium is nothing—nothing but a means to reach a higher end.

It is seldom that wood, which was grown more than four thousand years before the Christian era, is used in the construction of a present day residence, and yet this really happened recently in Edinburgh Scotland, where a mantel was fashioned from wood said to be six thousand year s old. The wood, an oak tree, was found in a sand pit at Musselburgh. thirteen feet below the surface. <person>Professor Geike</person>, of the geology chair of the University of Edinburgh, after personally examining the strata in which the oak was found, said the tree, which was five feet nine inches in diameter, must be at least six thousand years ago, and describes it as a relic of neolithic man. It was in a fine state of preservation, due to the sand, and was easily workable.
