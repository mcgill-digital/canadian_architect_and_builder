Two of the classes in most common use are those known as cut nails and wire nails. The former are cut by machinery out of sheets of iron and have their angles sharp but rough ; the latter are known also as French nails (a pointes de Paris) are round, very tough, and are supposed to possess the good quality of not splitting the wood when properly used. In some recent experiments in the United States to ascertain the relative holding powers of these two classes of nails some interesting facts were developed, In the 58 series of tests, comprising ten pairs of cut and wire nails, of one size and weight, driven into spruce wood, 1160 nails were used, varying in length from 1/8 to 6 inches, and in each case the cut nails showed superior holding power. An analysis of the several tests is as followsIn spruce wood in 9 series of tests, comprising 9 sizes of common nails (longest 6 inches, shortest I 1/8 in.) the cut nails showed an average superiority of 47.51 per cent.In spruce wood in 6 series of tests, comprising six sizes of light common nails (longest 6 inches, shortest 1 1/8 in.) the cut nails showed an average superiority of 47.40 per cent.In spruce wood, in 16 series of tests, compromising 15 sizes of finishing nails (longest 4 inches, shortest in.) the cut nails showed an average superiority of 72.22 per cent.In spruce wood, in six series of tests, comprising 6 sizes of box nails (longest 4 inches, shortest I 1/4 in.) the cut nails showed an average superiority of 50.88 per cent.In spruce wood, in 4 series of tests, comprising 4 sizes of floor nails (longest 4 inches, shortest 2 in.) the cut nails showed an average superiority of 80.03 per cent.In spruce wood, in above 40 series of tests, comprising 40 sizes of nails (longest 6 inches, shortest 1/8 in.) the cut nails showed an average superiority of 60.50 per cent.<article title="VALUE OF ADVERTISEMENTS " author="">VALUE OF ADVERTISEMENTS.WE have no patience with those mistaken minded members of the architectural profession who look at the advertising pages of their periodicals as useless, burdensome material, to be torn off without a second thought and consigned to the waste basket. These men are always behind the times, opinionated to the last degree, and lacking that knowledge of improvements in building materials and appliances which they owe to their clients. They do not realize that through the advertising columns of the professional journals there is set forth the record up to date of the inventions and discoveries that are enabling us to build better, more quickly, more cheaply. The manufacturer, introducing a new form of building material, or some patented appliance, seeks to reach the architects through what seems to him the most natural, the most legitimate channels,—the advertising column of the architectural press.- The brick-builder.
