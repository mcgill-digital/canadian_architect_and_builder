opening in the basement of a house. The reason was, probably because his corner of the basement was badly ventilated, and in addition to this it was near the kitchen fire above, so that moisture was drawn in and rested on the beam. Various methods of removing the fungus were tried but it always made its appearance again, so that ultimately the beam was taken out and replaced with an iron girder.

Dry rot is sometimes only to be detected by its sickly smell, and in one case in particular where to all appearances the wood sound. but where the smell had been noticed, it was found that the joinery was quite rotten beneath a skin of paint that covered it, and the floorboards had rotted from below, up to within 1/8 of an inch of the upper surface. Want of ventilation of the space under the floor was the cause.

HE ladies of the "Hotel Dieu" having decided upon the erection of new hospital buildings, some time ago commissioned Mr. <person>E. Tanguay</person>, architect, to visit Paris to examine several of the most important hospitals in that city with a view of applying the experience thus obtained in the construction of their new buildings here. Mr. Tanguay subsequently prepared plans and the work has now been contracted for and the buildings commenced. The entire cost will be in the neighborhood of $115,000, accommodation being provided for about 120 beds. It is expected that these buildings will form the basis for a model hospital, every pains being token to have them erected in accordance with the most advanced ideas of what a perfect hospital should be. Mr. <person>Thos. Pampalon </person>is the contractor for masonry works and Mr. <person>E. St. Pierre </person>for carpentry works.

Mr. Tanguay is also charged with the improvements now being made to the venerable <building>Basilica Quebec City</building>. Some exterior work is to be done, but the improvements mainly consist of interior decoration, including several stained glass windows. A steam heating apparatus is also being constructed by Messrs. <firm>Picard & Son</firm>. The Cost of the whole will be about $20,000.

The interior of St. Albans church is also being completed from Mr. Tanguays designs, at a cost of about $15,000.

The <building>parish church of Beauport</building>, which was destroyed by fire about three months ago, is now being rebuilt. It was one of the very few examples of pointed architecture to be seen among the Roman Catholic churches of this part of the Province of Quebec. In addition to the original church

narthex is to be built to the west front with tower and spire at either end, the whole to be constructed of the local limestone with Deschambault stone trimmings. Mr. <person>F. X. Berlinguet </person>is the architect employed on the work. Your correspondent has not heard the estimated amount of expenditure, but assumes cost will be upwards of $75,000.

The new hotel project still hangs fire. Plans were submitted at a recent meeting by Messrs. <person>H. Sta</person>vely, Quebec, and <person>G. F. Stalker</person>, Ottawa, who had jointly prepared the same. Plans were also submitted by Messrs. <firm>Rotch & Tilden</firm>, of Boston. As yet no decision has been arrived at. Both sets of plans were publicly exhibited at the Exchange; large numbers of our citizens examined them, each plan having its admirers. Further comment would be out of place at the present stage.

(Correspondence or the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)

 NO contracts of any importance have been let since my last writing,  except perhaps the <building>Sun Life Building Montreal</building>, the stonework of which has been awarded to <person>Peter Lyall </person>and woodwork to <person>Robert Beckham</person>, The plans for the <building>Victoria Hospital Montreal</building>, as I mentioned last month, have been remodelled and the two lowest tenderers in each trade asked to compete again.

ALLEGED BOODLE CONTRACTORS.

There is quite a degree of excitement among politicians over what are called the "Whelan-Pacaud" boodle transactions arising over the contracts for the <building>Quebec Court House</building>, The building was originally contracted for something under two hundred thousand dollars, and has already cost the province, I hear, close upon a million dollars. <person>Mr. Whelan</person>, one of the contractors, acknowledges having paid large sums of money to certain gentlemen in order to get his estimates passed through Parliament, and in fact has openly staled so through the press, the result being that a royal commission composed of two lawyers, one from Quebec and one from Montreal, has been appointed to examine into "one particular charge.' One meeting has been already held, and the commissioners are shortly to proceed with the evidence of Mr. Whelan. It is doubtful if any satisfactory information will arise out of the enquiry, as one of the witnesses is reported as having stated that he will risk being put in jail rather than give the names of the parties to whom he paid money. It seems too bad that we can not get things done in an honest and honorable way in any contracts where politicians are interested. All contractors generally complain of having been bled. I cannot far my part see where the money charged to the construction of the Quebec Court House can possibly have gone unless there was a leak somewhere. I am sure if done in a private office it would not have cost one half the amount stated. It would be very interesting to have a bill of quantities of the material used in the construction of this building, together with the current prices for similar work and those actually paid the contractors.

HARBOR IMPROVEMENT.

Two of the Government engineers appointed to examine the report on plan No. 6, have visited the city during the month and made an examination of the plans prepared by <person>Mr. Kennedy </person>and <person>Mr. St. George</person>, and an interim report is shortly expected. The harbor commissioners, however, are not as anxious now to hurry the report, as the season is so far advanced that nothing can be done this year.

STRIKES.

Work has been so scarce during the last few weeks that we have heard nothing further regarding the threatened strike of the carpenters and painters, and judging from present prospects it is not likely we will have any serious labor troubles this year.

NOTES.

Some residents of Cote St. Antoine are endeavoring to agitate the question of annexation to the city of Montreal, but the matter has not taken definite shape yet.

The laying of the corner stone of the new <building>Y. M. C. A. building Montreal </building>on Dominion Square took place on Tuesday, the 10th inst., with the usual ceremonies.

The Grand Trunk has commenced the construction of the Wellington street subway under their contract which is being constructed at the joint expense of the city and railway for the convenience of vehicles and foot passengers. This is the initiative of getting rid of the deadly level crossings, and we hope in the near future to see them all abolished.

The <assoc>Canadian Society of Civil Engineers </assoc>have closed their fortnightly meetings far the season, the last one being held in <building>McGill College</building>. The Society's office is now transferred to their new rooms on the corner of St. Catherine and Mansfield streets, where the library and reading room will be kept open during the summer.

HAT a bewildering vast of possibility is opened to the designer and colorist by the revolutions of modern machinery The wonder is not that we see so much that is vulgar, but that the artist does not more often err with such a plethora of materials, This very condition has given birth to what may be called a false or sham taste, which eschews everything with positive qualities and exalts the negative attributes of namby-pambyism in whatsoever lne it may appear. There is so much bad taste displayed on every hand under the paraded title of particularly good taste, one feels compelled at times to give utterance to protests which continually arise in the mind at the incorrect conception which may be said almost to prevail on this question. Men flatter themselves that they are building a house in the best taste, when its chief merit lies in the fact that like a barn, it has no points that challenge criticism. We see plenty of such houses around us. Women hunt for days to match a color in dressing, because it is such good taste to be dressed all in one color. The slight difference in shade or tint which they endeavor so assiduously to overcome may have been the only relief to the otherwise monotonous costume. People decorate their houses with the fear continually before their eyes that they may get some red or blue or yellow in their rooms and destroy their tasteful appearance. I wish to make a few observations on this last.

No doubt white walls are greatly to be preferred to ill-judged and ill-proportioned schemes of design or color. But to exalt the purely negative qualities of insipid greys, buffs, sages, and so on, above the richer tones which these merely shadow, is very much like singing the praises of well-watered wine, We are told sometimes with learned affectation, that you must use these washed-out tints in order to gain that very desirable repose in the treatment of walls and ceilings. What is repose? We speak of the erstwhile loud and angry sea sinking to repose. Do we speak of the repose of the shallow fluid never roused to action of any kind? There is a fascination in looking upon a lordly lion stretched in sleep in inaction, and for what reason? Simply that we see perfect strength and symmetry in repose, on which the eye rests with pleasure. Where is there a more restful sight than a glowing flower garden or a conservatory of rich exotics? Is there anything vulgar in it, or is t a display of bad taste? How soon may we expect this era of false aestheticism to pass away?

But, says one, where will you always get the controlling hand which shall ensure good taste in the use of more positive design or color? This I am not writing about, but would reply,
