LAC WATER VARNISH.---Shellac, 6oz. ; borax, 1 1/2oz; water,



pint. Boil together until the lac is dissolved. If bleached lac is used a white varnish will be made if the orange shellac, the varnish will have a pale brown color. This varnish makes a fair vehicle for water colors. It is a good paper varnish, and dries with a fair lustre and with a hard coat, which is waterproof. By adding any of the soluble coal tar colors colored varnishes can be made.



GLUE VARNISH.---Dissolve jib. of good pale glue in two gallons of water. The color of this varnish depends very much on the quality of the glue used if the best gelatin, then a white varnish will be made if a brown glue, then a brown varnish. This varnish is not very good, because of the sticky coat it gives, which is not waterproof. By adding, just before using, a small quantity of bichrornate of potassium (1oz. in two gallons), the coat becomes nearly waterproof. It is important that the bichrornate be added just before use, as it would act on the varnish and cause it to set into a gelatinous, unworkable mass. This varnish forms the basis of some leather varnishes. A little thymol or borax may be added as a preservative.



NEW PUTTY FOR METALS.â€”A new putty for metals, says the "Gewerbe," is being offered for sale from Switzerland. It is a metallic alloy, which melts at about 25O C. (482 F.) like lead, and can be poured into the finest moulds on account of its easy fusibility. Another characteristic of this flew putty, and one which recommends it especially for use is the great binding power which it shows in union with all kinds of materials, such as stone, masonry and metal. Owing to its great density, it is greatly adapted for repairing leaks in water and gas pipes, oil receptacles, etc. Its low specific gravity, which is about 1.5, as well as the circumstance that it expands in cooling, thus securing absolute tightness of the puttied fissures, have caused it to meet with a favorable reception. When the putty is to be used, break it into small pieces, and melt these in an iron kettle over a moderate fire, thus obtaining a highly fusible mass. For casting small objects, lime made of plaster of paris, loam or sand may be used.
