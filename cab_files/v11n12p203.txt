THE special number of the CANADIAN

Announcement.	ARCHITECT ANI) BUILDER which for several years past has been published



at New Year's, will in future be issued late in March.

Preparations are already well under way for the publication in March of our special number For 1899, which it is hoped will fully maintain the standard

of former years.

Commenting upon the case, the Builders' Reporter remarks that picking may now be considered a sufficient ground for the promotion of place bricks to stocks. But in the early part of the century the difference between the two sorts was ad-
