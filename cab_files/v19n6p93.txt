ahead of last year in the number of buildings being erected, vet the work of this year is of a superior character, and it is thought that the cost will total an amount equal to, if not greater than that of 1905. There is considerable increase in the cost of building this year. and this has had a tendency to lessen the amount of work done. Still contractors report that they are kept very busy.

Solid brick is the popular style of construction for dwellings, there being very few brick veneer or cement houses erected.

The majority of dwelling houses range in price from $2,5OO to $5,000 which seems to meet the requirements of persons of moderate means. A pair of semidetached, two and a half story dwellings, on Main street., built. by Mr. <person>George J. White</person>, contractor, afford a fair specimen of this style of house. Each contains nine rooms and all modern conveniences. They are neatly finished throughout a rid possess all the requirements for cozy homes.

Of residences of a more expensive nature, a fair type s one being built on Ravenscliffe avenue, of which Mr. <person>Stewart. McPhie </person>is the architect.

St. Andrew's Presbyterian church, whose corner stone was laid a few weeks ago was planned by Messrs. <firm>Stewart & Witton</firm>.

One of the finest examples of cement concrete work to he seen in the province is <building>St. Anne's Roman Catholic church </building>on Sherman avenue.
