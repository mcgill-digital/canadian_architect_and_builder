An amalgamation has been made between the offices of Messrs. Sproatt & Rolph and S. G. Curry, Toronto. The combination will be known as Sproatt & Rolph, architects, S. G. Curry, consulting architect.



There are some 25 firms comprising the list of architects in South Africa and of these 13 Are in the Transvaal. Most of the names have the letters F.R.I.B.A. or A.R.I.B.A. after them so that the country may be said to have a good start in the way of architects. The native style, if it has any real expression, except in houses like that of Cecil Rhodes, where, for purposes of sentiment the most is made of what style there is, is not particularly expressive, but they have that great advantage for architectural style a definite climate which, if it has extremes has them only on one end of the thermometer ; not like ourselves who combine the climates of the extreme limits of Russia On one parallel of latitude.
