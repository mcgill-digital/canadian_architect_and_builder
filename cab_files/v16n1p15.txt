<article title="Builders as Lumber Dealers" author="">BUILDERS AS LUMBER DEALERS.



The builders and contractors of Columbus, Ohio, are going to establish a retail lumber yard. They announce that they have become tired of paying the exorbitant prices demanded by lumber dealers and now propose to become dealers themselves.

The American Lumberman comments on this decision as follows ''Let them get their yard well under way and they will learn sundry things. The lesson probably will he a costly one, but there are some people who cannot learn except by experience, and experience is always an efficient. though dear teacher. As they are not lumbermen, though more or less familiar with lumber, they will have to learn about sources of supply, how to chase tip delinquent cars, how to estimate the fairy tales offered by lumber salesmen, how to unravel the intricacies of freight rates and rebates, how to get rid of 10,000 feet of lumber that they had to take in order to get the 1,000 feet that they had to have, and many other problems of like nature. They will probably hire a manager and that manager will have to be paid, and they will discover that running expenses and leakage will be fully as large as the personal salary and modest profit of the lumber dealers whom they are trying to supersede."
