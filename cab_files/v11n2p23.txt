EVEN the terrible calamity at London Safe Building. has not taught the average man common sense. From the papers we find

that in several instances the advice of incompetent parties has been asked as to the safety of public buildings. Every man who calls himself a builder or an architect is not a safe or reliable authority upon construction. The Ontario Association of Architects have been doing their utmost to obtain from the Ontario Legislature such changes in their Act as would to some extent protect the public against the possibility of such accidents as the London disaster. The infrequency of accidents was quoted to prove that there was no necessity to protect the public against incompetency and recklessness. Those who had not been directly affected by the results of an accident could not remember that there had ever been any accidents. Accidents do occur, however, but unless they are accompanied by a great loss of life, they are very soon forgotten. An accident which could have been prevented by ordinary intelligence or tare is nothing more or less than a crime. The London disaster was from all appearances due to an extreme lack of constructional knowledge, or criminal carelessness or neglect.





To those who have closely watched the Engineers' course of events it has long been apStrike.

parent that the ever-increasing demands

of organized labor would some day bring about a gigantic struggle, which would once for all decide the resources of employers and employees. The battle has just been fought in Great Britain, and has proved a Waterloo for trades unionism. The right of employers to regulate the conduct of their own business has been established. The cost of the prolonged struggle is enormous. The direct loss to the strikers is placed at upwards of $5,000,000. When to this is added loss of employment due to the transfer of orders from British to foreign manufacturers, it will be seen that the struggle has proven disastrous to those who were instrumental in bringing it about. The trade of the nation has been seriously disturbed, and it is feared that a portion of it has been driven into the hands of other nations, never to return. It is to be hoped that the hard feelings engendered by this great struggle will now be allowed to die out, and that a spirit of chivalry will characterize the victors in their dealings with the vanquished.
