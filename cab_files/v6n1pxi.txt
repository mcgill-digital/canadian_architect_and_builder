STATUTORY DECLARATION.

HAMILTON, Jan. 5, 1892.

The following is a statutory declaration made by me before Mr. <person>J. V. Teetzel</person>, of the firm of <firm>Osler, Teetzel, Harrison & McBlain</firm>, Hamilton, to contradict misleading and unwarrantable charges of a Mr. John Watson in letters sent by him to the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DOMINION OF CANADA



COUNTY OF WENTWORTH



To WIT: 



I<person>, CHARLES HERBERT ACTON BOND</person>, of the City of  Hamilton, in the County of Wentworth, architectural draughtsman, do solemnly declare that in <person>Mr. Watson's </person>first letter he says that my criticisms on the carving of the Grand Opera House and <person>Mr. Tuckett</person>'s residence were made because the sculptor had laughed at a drawing furnished by me. Now, I was not aware, or in fact had not the  slightest idea that the drawing had been criticized by anyone. I knew it had not been followed, but as it was only a suggestive motive for the carving, did not think much of this. I knew as soon as the stone was Cut that my drawing could not be carried out as the stonecutter had not made allowance for the profile suggested. I thought this was a mistake of the stonecutter and therefore could hardly blame the sculptor for not keeping to my idea. This is sufficient to prove that I felt no ill-will to the sculptor whatever. I merely criticized the drawing to try and raise the standard; at first I did not mention Mr. Tuckett's carving, but ultimately spoke of it to avoid the appearance of partiality to my then employer, who is architect of the building, this being one of the principal jobs of the season. Mr. Watson says in his first letter "that no carving was done on Mr. Tuckett's residence until the 15th of September," and in the second, "I most emphatically deny that any was executed until long after your correspondent's spiteful notes had been forwarded to you." My notes were written and sent to the Editor of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER in the middle of August and wee published on Saturday, September 17th. At the time these notes were written a large quantity of Mr. Tuckett's carving was started and so far forward as to justify criticism; there has been very little done on some of it since then. As to when it was commenced, I can only state that I with two eye witnesses, <person>Miss Newton </person>and Mr. <person>H. Newton</person>, of Toronto, visited the building on Saturday, July 23rd, and saw that the carving was then started; I also have correspondence dated July 26th referring to the carving. In his first letter, Mr. Watson wrote under a nom de plume, and when in the second he declared him self, I was very much surprised, as he on two separate occasions told me personally that he thought Mr. Tuckett's main entrance would have looked better if my drawing had been followed.

And I make this solemn declaration conscientiously believing the same to be true, and by virtue of the Act respecting Extra Judicial Oaths.

Declared before me at Hamilton, in the County of Went- worth, 5th day of January, 

	A.	D. 1893.	C. H. ACTON BOND.
