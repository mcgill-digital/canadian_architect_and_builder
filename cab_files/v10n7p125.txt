IF it were not for the costly consequences, Automatic Fire

	Protectors.	 one might be inclined to laugh

at the heat of the sun, reflected through a glass skylight on to automatic fire protectors, causing the protectors to blow out, and the consequent flooding of the building. But this recently happened, and caused "damage by water" to the extent of thousands of dollars. In future these automatic systems should be themselves protected by a liberal supply of ice piled up round them in hot weather



A SHIPMENT of 200,000 bricks was recently American Bricks for

South Africa	made to South Africa by the Union Brick Works, of Tacoma, W. T. The

purchasers were the Lingham Timber and Trading Co

There can be no doubt that Toronto is a beautiful city. The residential parts compare favorably with the much-praised cities of other countries, although much that is an eyesore, much that is bad from a sanitary point of view, and much that is dangerous and inviting to the fire fiend still remain, and the sooner these can be cleared away the better. A central park would pretty near complete Toronto, which is so favored by its natural surroundings. The woods and ravines of Rosedale are no mean adjuncts to the city parks, and approach has been made easy to a part at
