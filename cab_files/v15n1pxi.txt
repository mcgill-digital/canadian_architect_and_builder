about it and the care and pains he takes with it should evoke our warmest appreciation; and all this voluntary work added to his multitudinous duties at the School. If it were not that he best illust- rates it himself in the paper he has given us, " The Behavior of Steel Under Stress," I would feel called upon to take up more of your time and tell you of the behavior of Wright under stress.

BUILDING IN MONTREAL.



The second annual report of <person>Mr. Chausse</person>, Building Inspector, states that during 1901 there were erected 443 new buildings valued at $2,568,378, and alterations to buildings costing $332,361, the total expenditure being $2,900,733 as compared with $3,084,403 in 1900, and $2,370,080 in 1899. The Inspector reports last year as having been the busiest in the history of his department, extra work being imposed by the new building by-law He requests the Council to appoint an assistant inspector in order that the by-law may be properly enforced.





Very satisfactory progress has been made with the construction of the <building>new Toronto hotel</building>. The first five storeys have been completed and closed in, and work is proceeding on the interior. It has recently been decided to increase the height of the building by two  storeys which, in addition to giving increased accommodation will improve the appearance.



<assoc>The Bricklayers' Union of Toronto </assoc>is said to be considering the advisability of making a demand for an increase in the rate of wages at the termination of their present agreement with the employers on May 1st next. It is reported that this demand will be for an increase of 7 cents per hour, which if granted, would bring the rate per hour up to 45 cents. The builders' laborers are said to be considering a similar proposition, while the Teamsters' Union have already notified the contractors that after the 1st of May they will demand 45 cents per hour. The Plasterers' Union have made an agreement with the Builders' Exchange at 38 cents per hour. It will thus be seen that there is likely to be a demand all along the line for increase of pay. It is to be hoped that the effect of this announcement made so early in the year may not be prejudicial to the starting of new building projects.
