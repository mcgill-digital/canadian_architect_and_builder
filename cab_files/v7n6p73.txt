THE members of the American Society of Civil Engineers who are meeting in annual convention at Niagara Falls. will Visit Toronto on the 25th inst. by invitation of Sir Casimir Gzowski, ex-President of the Canadian Society. The members of the latter Society resident in Toronto, have arranged to give the visitors a fitting reception.





THE Court of Common Picas at New York has decided that a plumber who is not registered in accordance with the provisions of the plumbing ordinance of that City cannot legally enforce the payment of his accounts. This decision is said to have fallen like a bomb in the ranks of about five hundred unregistered plumbers in that City, and the Health Department is crowded with applicants for licenses.





IN our correspondence columns will he found an interesting article, accompanied by illustrations, relating to the recent landslide at St. Albans, Que., by Mr. Chas. Baillairge, of Quebec. It is a matter of some surprise to us that Mr. Baillairge, or some person of like practical experience, was not chosen by the government to report upon the causes, etc., of this catastrophe. It will he remembered that in the case of the great landslide at Quebec, in 1889, where fifty persons were killed, Mr. Baillairge's version of the cause of the accident prevailed over that of Prof. Laflamme, (who has been deputed to report on the latter occurrence) both before the Society of Civil Engineers and before the Supreme and Lower Courts, where the case was discussed.





THE effort of a company to secure the passage of a Bill through the I Dominion Parliament giving them the right to construct an elevated railway through certain of the principal streets of Montreal, was nullified by the determined opposition of the citizens. The Bill, as it passed the House, provides that before construction shall begin, compensation shall he made to the owners of property which would be damaged in value by the carrying out of the enterprise. This provision of the Bill will it is believed be sufficient to stop the further progress of the scheme. In a city c)f compact area like Montreal, there does not appear to exist the slightest necessity for an elevated street railroad. The electric street cars answer all the requirements, and in placing property owners beyond the reach of possible blackmail, Parliament has clone an act of simple justice. There has been too much juggling with public franchises of late in the city of Montreal.





ON the 13th inst., in the Chancery I Division Court, before Justices Boyd and Meredith, the appeal of Mr. Neelon, contractor for the new Toronto city buildings, from the decision of Mr. Justice Rose, which affirmed that the architect had authority under the contract to dismiss the contractor, came up for argument. The court agreed with the construction put upon the contract by thc trial judge, and dismissed the appeal with costs, unless the plaintiff chooses to pay the costs of such part of the proceedings as will he abortive in the event of a new trial, in case of which election and payment there will he a new trial. Mr. Neelon is said to have stated his intention previous to this appeal of carrying the case to the highest court of appeal should an unfavorable decision be recorded by the lower courts. Whether or not he still adheres to this determination we are not informed, but it is at least probable that the case will not terminate at the present stage.
