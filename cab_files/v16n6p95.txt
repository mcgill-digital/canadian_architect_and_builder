city in Canada. The climatic conditions in California, U.S.A., are such that it does not make much difference. In simmer you have climate in your favour; your building is more accessable; it costs nothing for artificial drying; you have no frost to contend with and your men have no broken time. I know I was caught twice in winter time—once in Vancouver, B. C.—when building Molson's Bank the frost brought down the Bank ceiling, which was very expensive; this was four years ago; two years ago I was caught with Rossland Post Office in winter time, and in that case it cost over 25 per cent, more. Carpenter work likewise suffers as does also painters' as they are nearly always humbugged waiting for plastering, etc.

We can do work cheaper in summer, as everything is dry and in much better condition. The only reason that we know could be advanced for cheaper winter work is that there is not usually

round, so that wages are the same, but the dark days are no profitable, for even though the hours are reduced to from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m., there are still days when it is too dark before quitting time. With all these items against us, contractors here figure no higher for inside work coming in winter, for the reason that it can be pushed along, whereas outside work at the same time may drag with uncertainty, carpenters at the best not averaging more than three quarters of the time outside, and bricklayers less during this period.

My opinion is, 1st, you cannot make the same progress 2nd, you cannot make the same job in winter as in summer. In winter it takes from 12 to 15 days to dry out the first coat of plastering before it is ready for the second coat, and that has to be done with furnaces, which means time and money that you have not to expend in summer. Also you have got to take into consideration waste of material in our line (plastering) which does not take

as much doing in winter, and rather than be idle, sometimes work is taken cheaper.

VANCOUVER ,May 9th, 1903.



As far as our experience goes in this city, and we have been in the business for fifteen years, inside work costs slightly more and is not so satisfactory when done in winter—that is to say in the months of November, December, January and February.

1st. A striking feature of this climate is the dampness of these months, making it necessary to close in a building and provide heat where there is a furnace it is simple, but in many cases temporary stoves are needed; either way means more or less extra cost, risk from fire and disfiguring of walls with smoke, etc. 2nd. The plastering in nearly all cases is not properly set and consequently many more cuts and marks will occur in it which can never be made as good as the original. 3rd. Creative care has to be exercised in getting the finishing lumber on the job in fine weather, and even then sometimes it is caught on the road in a storm which makes trouble, sometimes having to be renewed. 4th. As to labor, there is a steady demand for good men the year

place in summer. Therefore I fail to see how work can be done cheaper in winter than summer.

VANCOUVER, B. C., May 6th, 1903.

Re cost of inside work in summer v. winter. My experience is that there is very little difference. Where trade unions regulate the wages, making them the same per hour throughout the year as they generally do, I think the cost of inside work as well as outside work is greater in winter than in summer in our Country (Canada). There is more to contend with in several respects-such as bad light, too much moisture or frost, expense of heating and drying, difficulties in caring for materials. On the other hand a better grade of men can usually be obtained in the winter season; this is an advantage which almost makes up for the disadvantages, but not quite in my opinion.

A.	E. CARTER.





TORONTO, May 19th, 1903.



My opinion is that the inside work of an ordinary building, whether residential or commercial, cannot be executed more cheaply in winter than in summer. My reasons for this opinion are: 1st,-Artificial heat must be provided; 2nd,—Workmen always do more and better work in the bright days of summer than in the dull days of winter.
