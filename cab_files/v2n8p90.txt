(No. 7).— Is lake sand much used for building or other purposes in Toronto? How and where is it obtained? Would a preference be given to it over pit sand at nearly the same price? An answer will much oblige.—<person>M. E. PARK</person>, Cornwall, Ont.



(Reply to No. 7).—Lake sand is not much used in Toronto for the reason that it is next to impossible to obtain it. Contractors are not allowed to take it from the lake shore in proximity to the city. Lake sand is certainly much preferred to pit sand, especially for large and important buildings We are inclined to believe that contractors on such work would be willing to pay 25 cents per load more for it than for pit sand,---THE

Interior elaborately finished in hardwood. Supplied with all modern improvements and conveniences. The job was let by separate contracts. The contractors were as follows: Contractor for carpenter work, <firm>Bryan Bros.; </firm>mason work, <person>R. Jocelyn</person>; painting and glazing, <person>A. Bowen </person>plumbing and heating, <person>H. Evison</person>, Collingwood. Total cost of building, including grounds, $27,000.

HOUSE FOR DR. NATTRESS, CARLTON STREET, TORONTO.—<firm>STRICKLAND

& SYMONS</firm>, ARCHITECTS, TORONTO.

The plans and elevations are adapted to a frontage of 40 feet, without light on either side. They are built of red brick and Credit Valley stone, and cost

tion on James street south, will be, when finished, a plain substantial building neat in appearance, but in my humble judgment, not approaching by any means in architectural design smaller buildings in other cities; but, in this case, the means justifies the end.

There are two commodious school buildings being erected, one in the east and the other in the west end of the city. Both are brick buildings with stone dressings, but neither has the architectural design and appearance of the Victoria School lately erected on Hunter street in this city, a building that does infinite credit to the architect.

I may remark that there are quite a number of villa residence being erected in the suburbs and adjoining townships, so that our contractors, though not doing the rushing business of former years, have so far kept a considerable number of hands employed, and if the fall trade is good (as some expect it will be) both employer and employee will have little reason to complain at the close of the season.

I am unable to send an official record of the month's building operations, for the reason that no official record worthy of the name is kept. However, our late inspector will now be probably succeeded by an official who will straighten out matters effectually, and then it will be easy to give a true and correct record of building operations in Hamilton.

I am glad to observe that the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER Is fast coming into the hands of our building operatives and their apprentices.

THERE has not been much change in building operations in the Ambitious City since my last report, and up to now the building season of

1889 has by no means been a busy or profitable one, compared with former years, either in point of quantity or price There has not been any stagnation in general building, but owing to the number of empty dwelling houses to be found now in every part of the city. there has been very little desire on the part of capitalists to invest in the erection of new ones. However, there have been contracts let for building some very good brick dwelling houses in different parts of the city, mostly in blocks of two, three, and four all two story brick, with stone cellars. Some are in the Queen Anne style, and in all of them is shown a decided improvement in outward appearance at least, over those formerly erected. The old style, plain brick front, without any effort at design or ornament, has been decided in favor of bay window, the porch, and tasty display of ornamental and colored brick work in arches and string courses is having good effect at a small additional cost, with the result that these newly finished houses are quickly rented, thus leaving the old ones to stand vacant.

The system of the new city hall is now completed with the exception of the main tower. It is a very fair specimen of architecture, real and chaste in design and ornament, and in its prominent situation shows a goad effect

The new <building>Presbyterian Church, Hamilton, Ont. </building>on the corner of Emerald and King streets has just been commenced.

The plans for the new free library will be submitted for tenders in a few days.

Mr. <person>J. M. Ross </person>is building a brick store On Main St., this city, cost $10,000.



The three stores built by <person>Mr. Brydon</person>, contractor, for Mr. Freeman, are completed, also the addition to the Foulds Block.

There are several private residences going up in different parts of the city. Work on the new city market is progressing very slowly.

THE JACQUES CARTIER MONUMENT.

O

 N the 24th June last, St. Jean Baptiste Day, took place the unveiling of the above monument, the ceremony being witnessed by an immense concourse of people estimated to number from 25,000 to 30,000 persons; the following description of the monument and its site is taken from the Quebec Morning Chronicle:

The site of the monument is on the north branch of the St. Charles and immediately overlooking the river with the city of Quebec in the background, an excellent view being obtained of its principal points of interest. Nearest is seen St. Rochs, then the suburbs of St. John surmounted by Mount Pleasant, and away to the east, the Parliament House, the Upper Town and the Battery, the Basilica and Laval University, The monument is surrounded at some distance by an iron railing which encloses however a space considerable enough to contain several hundred people.

The monument, which is ereated in the centre of the enclosure above described, is about 24 feet high. It is almost square in form, measuring 8 1/2 feet at the base and feet at the summit which has quite an ornamented cornice. Below the cornice, the granite of which the monument is composed is polished on each of its four sides. On the north face is round
