NOTES.



Compoboard is made of wooden skits 4 feet long and 1 inch wide, joined in an endless Webb, so that the 4 feet length of the slat ferms the width of the complete hoard. Therefore in a long board, say 4 feet x 9 feet, the end-grain of the wood is on the longer edge in small pieces the  end-grain edge is readily detected by the fact that it shows the joining of the slats

inch by inch. The faint lines at the top show how the slats run from endâ€”grain edge to end-grain edge. Always join the board on the end-grain edge. Let the joint he as tight as possible. It will never alter by shrinking or swelling, and when suitably stopped can be painted, papered, or distempered. The board is made in no less than six qualities, and they range from 7-32 of an inch to 3/8 of an inch.
