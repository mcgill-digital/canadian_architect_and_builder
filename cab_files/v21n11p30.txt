the resisting moment of a square rod whose side is s, we obtain

D

S = —38

As this is close to 1-40 of the diameter of the column,

we may use the same size of square rod as that used in

the coil.

It is recommended, therefore, that reinforced concrete columns he made round or octagonal and that the entire area of the circle or octagon be considered as taking the load; also that the reinforcement be made of a coil of square steel rod 'of a diameter one-fortieth that of the column; also that just inside of this coil eight rods of tile same diameter be wired to the coil. At thc end of a coil tile rod should lap a half circle, as this would he about 55 diameters.

The unit of 550 pounds per square inch would he

used for lengths up to 10 diameters. Between 10 and

25 diameters the allowed unit pressure would be found

by the following formula:

	1

	P	670 — 12 —

		D



where p — allowed pressure per square inch,

1 = length in inches.

D — diameter in inches.



Columns more slender than 1-25 of their length should be avoided. The same reinforcement should be used in all columns of a given diameter, so that flexural and eccentric stresses will be taken care of in long columns.
