PUBLICATIONS.



Light heat and Power in Buildings by <person>Altou D. Adams</person>, Member <assoc>American Institute of Electrical Engineers</assoc>. One 12 mo. vol., cloth 102 pp. Price $1 New York W. T. Comstock.



This book is intended as a convenient manual on the subjects treated, its object being to present in compact form the main facts on which selections of the sources for light, heat and power in buildings should be based. The texture of special interest in the work and its main novelty, that of arrangement by cost of service from widely different sources, are set down side by side.



<assoc>The American League for Civic Improvement</assoc>, whose headquarters are at Springfield, Ohio, has published in an 8o page booklet entitled The Twentieth Century City, the proceedings of the annual convention of the League held at Buffalo in August of last year. Not the least important of the suggestions is the action of the Convention, urging the provision at the St. Louis Exposition of an object lesson in modern city making by the arrangement of a model city, not on a small scale, but "life size."





The effect of artificial light on colours is sometimes overlooked when choosing a decorative scheme. The

fact is, gas and electric light will change colours wonderfully. Yellow is paled and sometimes wholly lost certain blues turn black ; other blues, absorbing the yellow light, become green ; such colours as violet, pink or purple are entirely altered. To guard against disagreeable effects, the colours used should be so selected and juxtaposed that the finished work will look as well by night as by day, even though the whole will be somewhat changed in tone.



Recently published statistics of the mineral production of Canada show an increase of 67 percent. since 1890, the total being now $6,285,000 as compared with

$3,761,000 in 1890. A large item in the increase is Portland cement, the manufacture of which is increasing at a very rapid rate. Canada now manufacturers 283,000 barrels per year, or about 50 per cent. of the quantity consumed.

" What would you like to be when you grow up?" asked an old gentleman.

"I'd like to be a bricklayer," replied the boy.

"That's a commendable ambition. Why would you like to be a bricklayer?"

"Cause there's so many days when bricklayers can't work."
