1894.



<article title="" author="">The commencement of a new year, which will be the seventh in the life of this Journal, prompts a few remarks of a personal character, and concerning the professional and business interests with which we stand identified.

IT will be observed that in this first number of the new year a departure has been made from our usual practice of publishing illustrations of exclusively Canadian buildings. Having been repeatedly requested to reproduce occasionally foreign subjects it was decided to give up the present number to illustrations of work of this character, and the cover design, for which we are indebted to Mr. <person>Ernest Wilby</person>, was worked out in harmony with this idea. It is our purpose in future In reproduce from time 10 time such specimens of the work of foreign architects as it is hoped will prove interesting and instructive to our readers.

Regarding the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	it can



be said that despite some adverse influences, it continues to make stead)' progress. Additions to the number of its subscribers throughout Canada, and especially the towns and cities of the Northwest, have of late been gratifyingly large. As an index to the esteem in which the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is held by some of its subscribers4 we quote from the letter of an architect in a western Ontario city as follows



take all the best architectural publications in the States six in number—and yours and not considering price, I think yours de best of the lot for everyday practical work, and for good solid reading." The writer of this letter adds, "Can you suggest anything I can do to help you. --if so, it shall be done." It would enhance not a little the interest and prosperity of the Journal, if every architect, builder and contractor who is a subscriber, would evince similar anxiety to individually assist its development. To those who have been negligent in this particular, the present affords a good opportunity to turn over a new leaf.

A strong effort will be put forth to give to the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER during 1894 a greater interest than I has ever had before, and without lessening its value to architects, to make it the source of information of a useful character to master builders and contractors. The co-operation of our readers is invited. Let us know what class of information is most required and we will endeavor to supply it. Especially do we invite requests for information on problems arising out of construction work of any kind; in such cases an earnest effort will be made to throw light on the difficulty. If knowledge of new and improved methods has been acquired let us know about it so that our readers may share the advantage. There has in the past been too little in the nature of exchange of experiences on this line. Let us have more of it in the future, and the result will be beneficial to everybody. Let no reader think he knows it all "—he doesn't. If he will give others the benefit of what he does know he can depend on receiving equally valuable information in return.
