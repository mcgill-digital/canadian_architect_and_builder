ARM AIR

Sr. MARYS Out., July 9th, 1900.

TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN

By authority of the Public School Board of the town of St. Mary's I am authorized to say that the Board having placed two No. 24 Kelsey' warm air generators in the Central School building last fall, and having ample opportunity to test them last winter, they can now bear testimony to their unqualified success and satisfaction.

We found them great savers of feel, and unlike our former furnaces it matters not in which direction the wind blows. We believe that they not only produce more heat with less fuel, but they also produce a better quality of air, being absolutely gas and dust proof. All the heat is utilized there being none in the cellar where the heaters are located. The older the day the more satisfactory are the results notwithstanding the special difficulties in heat

	in the building.	Yours truly,

		   T.	D. STANLEY,

			 Chairman of Com. of St. Mary's

			          Public School Board.
