 HAMILTON paper recently published an article from a correspondent which depicted in a truly alarming manner the dangers resulting from defective plumbing and insanitary surroundings generally. If our memory is not at fault, the writer estimated that 20 per cent, of the deaths were the result of this cause, Whether as a mere coincidence, or as a result of the article referred to, we noticed a few days later the appointment of Mr. <person>J. M. Byren </person>as Building and Plumbing Inspector. We hope that this commendable step will be followed in due time by the abolition of the dual position and the appointment of an inspector of buildings and an inspector of

plumbing.	_________________

BOUT a year ago reference was made in these columns to a resolution passed by the Committee on Works and approved by the City Council of Toronto, providing that all sewers of fifteen inches diameter and upwards should be constructed of brick. We pointed out at the time that for small sewers, vitrified pipe was to be preferred to brick, its smooth interior facilitating the flow of sewage matter, its durability when properly laid being beyond dispute, and the cost of construction being substantially less than in the case of brick, In the absence of any satisfactory explanation of their action, people were unkind enough to say that the aldermen were simply throwing a bait to catch the votes of the brickmakers and bricklayers. However this may have been, we are credibly informed that $11,000 above the cost of pipe sewers was expended on the construction of small brick sewers last year. The City Engineer now recommends that the resolution be rescinded on sanitary, economical and other grounds.

HE Board of Works of the city of Toronto has been trying the experiment of constructing public works by day labor under the supervision of city officials instead of by contract. It is not surprising to learn that the results in the case of works of any importance, have not been satisfactory. As an instance, a bridge for the construction of which a tender of $6,000 was received, cost by day labor, $8,349, a loss to the City on a single contract of $2,349. The City Engineer expresses the opinion that were the city to purchase the necessary appliances and enter upon the construction of public works on an extensive scale, the work could be done as cheaply if not cheaper by day labor than by contract. This might prove to be the case for a time, but such a system would be well-nigh certain to open the door for abuses which would eventually make the undertaking a costly one to the citizens. It is proverbially true that economy does not enter into the practice of the city's employees to the extent to which it appears in the contractors methods of conducting his business. While no doubt there are in the city's employ foremen and inspectors of undoubted faithfulness to the interests placed under their charge, it would be found difficult to secure a sufficient number of such persons to manage successfully and with the greatest economy the expenditure of the large sums annually placed at the disposal of the Committee on Works.

HE appointment of an inspector or inspectors of scaffolds is still engaging the attention of a committee of the Toronto city council. The City Solicitor has been asked for his opinion on the following points: "Will the city be held liable in the event of a workman being injured by reason of a scaffold giving way after the said scaffold has been approved of by the city inspector? Will a claim against a contractor for injuries received by a workman in consequence of an accident occurring by the giving way of the scaffold which has been constructed according to the specification be in any way prejudiced ?" The city authorities do well to satisfy themselves as to where the responsibility for accidents would rest under a system of municipal inspection, before they decide to put such a system in
