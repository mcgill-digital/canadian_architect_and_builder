" author="">NOTES.



In a recent lecture on geology in Glasgow, Mr. A. McWilliam, A.R.S.M., stated that granite consisted mainly of two minerals, quartz (hardness proportionately 6) and felspar (hardness 7), whilst the hardness of a best-quality Sheffield pocket-knife blade was 6½ The wearing powers of granite would therefore be readily understood. Pure clay with less than about 2 per cent. of potash and soda was a fireclay; if white, a china clay 01 a



pipeclay ; while containing 5 per cent. of oxides of iron and generally a fair amount of potash and soda it became an ordinary red brick clay.
