<doctype type="text">the weight to at least 100 pounds for offices, increasing in buildings devoted to mercantile purposes.

<person>Mr. Aylsworth </person>was opposed to the report in its present form being adopted. It might serve as a recommendation or suggestion to a committee who should give it more time than could be spared now in convention.

<person>Mr. Power </person>was in favor of taking more time to consider the matter so as to prepare a by law carefully that could not be picked to pieces. He thought the committee in the time at its disposal had done well, but he would like to see a little more time allowed for consideration.

<person>Mr. Symons </person>thought the report could only be regarded as a partial report, and advocated giving the matter further consideration. He moved that the whole matter be referred to a committee of city architects to be named by the President for further consideration.

<person>Mr. Gouinlock </person>seconded the motion.

<person>Mr. Darling </person>thought it advisable to have as wide a discussion as possible regarding ding so important a matter; he thought too much tine could not be expended on it. He felt that in the short time that could be devoted to it now a satisfactory conclusion could not be reached, and he did not deem it wise to adopt the report in its present shape as an expression coming from the whole Association.

<person>Mr. Gregg </person>thought the discussion so far had shown that there were many additional points to be considered, and he supported the motion of Mr. Symons, that it be left to a local committee to consider it in all its respects, including the state of the present city by-law.

<person>Mr. Symons' </person>amendment was then carried.

The President requested the former committee to retain the matter in their hands and to place it in as good shape as possible, and then to call a meeting of the city members to further discuss it.

A paper entitled "Electricity for Architects," was then read by Mr. <person>John Langton</person>, which is published elsewhere.

Mr. Aylsworth then presented the report of the temporary committee on the improvement of cities approving of the idea and suggesting the appointment of a permanent committee for carrying it Out.

On motion of Mr. Aylsworth seconded by Mr. Baxter, the report of the committee was adopted.

The Civic Adornment Committee was then appointed by the President, as follows

For Toronto, Mr. Aylsworth and Mr. D. B. Dick ; for Kingston, Mr. Power; for Hamilton, Mr. Edwards; for Stratford, Mr. Baxter; for Ottawa, Mr. Billings, with power to add to their number.

EXHIBITION OF WORK BY MEMBERS.

A number of slides prepared from drawings and photographs of designs by members were then exhibited by means of the stereopticon. and as the views were thrown on the wall comments were made by the meeting upon points in the design of the buildings. There were about eighty slides exhibited and much interest was shown.

On motion of Mr. Gouinlock, seconded by Mr. Belcher, the thanks of the Association were tendered to Mr. C. H. C. Wright for preparing the slides for the views shown.



ELECTION OF OFFICERS.



Messrs. <person>Post </person>and <person>Helliwell </person>having been appointed scrutineers, the President suggested that it be a recommendation that retiring members of the Council shall not be eligible for one year after their period of service.

<person>Mr. Edwards </person>moved that the Association adopt the suggestion made by the President.

<person>Mr. Gordon </person>seconded the motion, which was carried unanimously.

The election was then proceeded with, and the following gentlemen declared elected as members of the Council Messrs.

<person>F.	J. Alexander. </person>of Ottawa, <person>G. M. Moore</person>, of London, and <person>W. R. Strickland</person>, of Toronto.

Votes of thanks were passed to the Minister of Education for the use of the building to Messrs. <person>Galbraith</person> and Wright and the members of the School of Practical Science for assistance on this and other occasions ; to <person>Professor Coleman</person>, Mr. John Langton and Mr. <person>Hamilton McCarthy </person>for their valuable papers.

The convention then closed.



THE DINNER.



Following their usual custom, the Toronto members of the Association gave a dinner in honor of the non-resident members. The event took place this year at McConkey's restaurant, at the close of the Convention. About fifty members and guests participated in the enjoyment of the many good things, of a physical and intellectual character, which the occasion afforded.

<article title="Portland Cement: A Plea for a Greater Uniformity in the Tests and Specifications" author="Wright, C.H.C.">PORTLAND CEMENT—A PLEA FOR A GREATER



UNIFORMITY IN	THE TESTS AND SPECIFICATIONS.*



By C. H. C. WRIGHT, B. A. Sc.



At the present time when the <assoc>American Society of Civil Engineers </assoc>are using a uniform system of testing and the <assoc>Canadian Society of Civil Engineers </assoc>is endeavoring to get its members to work along more uniform lines, it may not be out of place for me to draw your attention to this question.

In a publication of last year (1893) by <person>George L. Sutcliffe</person>, Associate R.I.B.A., on "Concrete," we find the following:—" The variety of specifications for Portland cement is somewhat bewildering." He is speaking of English specifications. This is not so in Germany, for there they have standard regulations. In England they are taking steps to remedy this evil, and there is no reason why we in Ontario should not do likewise.

The object in testing Portland cement is not that pursued in testing other materials of construction, viz to determine their absolute strength, except in a few special circumstances—the reason being that the cement is seldom employed where it is subjected to stresses in the vicinity of its safe load. What we do wish to know, however, is that the cement will set, harden and continue to increase in strength, and not subsequently disintegrate or blow. Many of you have heard the statement that there is no use in testing cement, as the proper test is experience. There is no doubt but that the test of time in any actual construction is the very best, but how expensive when the material proves a failure. Or again, having proved that a particular brand is good, we are uncertain but that the very next shipment may prove to be utterly worthless, as illustrated by the following cases in the laboratory of the School of Practical Science: In August, 1894, there were two samples of the same brand of German Portland cement. The first was unfit for use, while the second was an excellent cement. In June and July, 1893. there were two samples of the same brand of English Portland cement—the first being unfit for use, while the second was a good cement. In February, 1892, there were two samples of Canadian Portland cement—the first being unfit for use while the second was a cement of excellent qualities.

I have made the above classification because it is very common in Ontario at the present time. We are then expected in the laboratory to make certain observations and from these predict the most probable behavior of the Portland cement in the work under construction. In order to determine with any degree of certainty the properties of a Portland cement, the observer requires from to 3 months, as will be shown later, but unfortunately in practice in Ontario he has but a week or two at his disposal. The observations usually made are:

Fineness of grinding; 2. Tensile strength; 3. Soundness; 4. Specific gravity or weight, the latter being omitted quite frequently, while we have occasionally added chemical analysis, compression and transverse tests.

With a complete knowledge of the above we are able to say what may be expected of the samples of Portland cement under consideration.

FINENESS OF Grinding-- It has been demonstrated and admitted for some considerable time by all who use Portland cement, that any particles which will not pass a No. 50 sieve, i.e., 2500 meshes per sq. inch, are inert and act as sand. It is now, however, generally he]d that particles not passing a 100 sieve are inert. From this point alone it will be seen that the question of fineness is a very serious one. The cement in practice is mixed with definite proportions of sand; is it not therefore of first importance to know how much sand is already in the barrel labeled "Portland Cement?" Further, as the duty of the resulting fine cement is to form an envelope around the particles of sand and unite them together, it follows that the finer the grinding the less the amount of cement required, or the greater the amount of sand which may be mixed with it. One of our English authorities, Mr. <person>H. K. Bamber</person>, in discussing this point says, that these large particles (retained in a No. 50 sieve) not only remain inert while the cement around them is setting, but after the process of hardening is well under way, they absorb water, causing internal expansion and the disruption of the cement in the same manner as small lumps of lime disintegrate.

Mr. <person>W. F. Reid </person>says he had not been able to produce such expansion experimentally, and did not think it took place in good cement. Whether it is true or not that these particles do afterwards absorb moisture to the detriment of the cement, it is still desirable to have the cement properly ground, and the German and Canadian manufacturers are paying special attention to this question.

The majority of English cements that we receive in Ontario are not properly ground. While on this point I would like to say that the spirit of our Canadian manufacturers as evinced in this matter of grindings is deserving of commendation—for they have done this in the face of the following facts (1) the consumer—our architects and engineers—are willing to accept a much more coarsely ground cement than they are producing

(2)	that the more coarsely ground cements stand a higher tensile stress than the finer ones when tested neat; (3) that the coarser a cement the higher its weight per striked bushel ; and (4) that
