from pretty. It has many quaint features, however, in the form of knobbed rhones, spouts instead of rainconductors, and basket windows. The design is royal and also unique, and the inn when finished will be by no means a conventional one. So close is the interest taken in the work connected with the rearranged hostelry by Her Royal Highness that she intends herself to paint the device on the sign that is to hang in old-time fashion over the doorway of the public entrance to the building, and the walls of the new apartments are to be artistically decorated according to her own scheme of treatment.

THE HOLY BLOSSOM SYNAGOGUE, BOND STREET, TORONTO.

J. W. SIDDALL, ARCHITECT.

The building, which is an adaptation of the Moorish style of architecture, is constructed of Ohio sandstone, plain and pressed brick. The most important feature of the Bond street facade, shown in the illustration, is an 18 foot. semi-circular arch, highly ornamented with terra cotta. In the tympanum of this arch are bands of stone containing the words in English and Hebrew,

The Holy Blossom Synagogue," " Hear, 0, Israel, the Lord our God the Lord is one," in gilded incised letters. Above the arch is a group of five windows with terra cotta columns and archivists ; on either side are flanking towers, containing long triplet windows and crowned by bulbous domes. At the angles of these towers, which contain the main staircases, are piers surmounted by smaller domes, the whole facade being crowned with arcaded cornices and balustrade.

The main entrances are in an open vestibule guarded by iron collapsible gates and lined with enameled bricks and terra cotta. In this vestibule are three doorways, two leading to the inner vestibules, from which are staircases to the main vestibule above ; the centre doorway leads to the school room.

The auditorium is lighted by a large central dome, decorated on a ground of blue of gradually decreasing density. A richly carved casing of quartered oak, 16 feet wide and 15 feet high, encloses the ark. Around the highly ornamented pulpit of the rabbi and desk of the cantor, radiate in concentric circles the seats of the congregation. The main gallery extends around seven sides of the octagon and over the front vestibules.

The school room, which is almost on a level with the

street, is divided by rolling partitions into eight class rooms.

The building is lighted with gas and electric light and heated by hot water and air.

The contractors were Messrs. Hutchinson & Carlyle.
