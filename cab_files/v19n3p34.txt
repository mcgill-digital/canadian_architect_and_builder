<doctype type="text">34	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



Over Specifying

Salisbury, in Connecticut, (so named because it was originally settled by a colony from Salisbury in Wiltshire), when its public library was being built, procured from the cathedral yard of the parent town a carved stone, which formed part of a heap of such rejects there but, in the library, has a place of honour as a central object over the mantel piece in the reading-room; where it is not only in itself a quaint and interesting ornament but serves to associate the little town with the Englishmen who founded it. The window tracery from the church of St. Botolph in Boston, Lincolnshire, which is built into the cloister arcade of <building>Trinity church in Boston</building>, Mass., has the same sort of association attaching to it; intensified by the fact that John Cotton, who came to New England from Boston in 1632, had been, for twenty-one years before he left England, vicar of St. Botolph's. There is a more private example in this country, where a stone, taken from the ruins of an ancient family seat in England, and carved with the ancestral coat of arms, ornaments the entrance porch of thc eldest son of the Canadian branch of the family. Here is a good kind of memento collecting.



If architects are to use standard specifications, which the hurry of business operations seems to

make necessary, it would be at least well to have more than one standard, and to take some initial pains, even at the expense of initial expenditure of time, to get the standards right for the kind of work. Most men, after all, have a practice which does not vary much in the range of subject matter; and buildings of one class by the same designer are as much like one another in the materials of their construction, as are boots of one class by the same maker. Why not have a standard specification, for each class, that will truly express the condition of material and workmanship that are expected for the money and can be insisted upon. To specify clear pine flooring not over three inches wide, and take 6 inches with knots, is to establish a state of demoralization that will produce nothing but bad work. If there is to be no standard fixed otherwise than by the point where the will of the architect and the will of the contractor reach a state of statical equilibrium, the contractor will get the best of it every time—and does. The standard of ordinary work in this country is already not what is right but what will do. The builders run our building business, and are justified under the circumstances in doing so. If the specified standard is not genuine and intended to be carried out, the contractor can only set his own standard; but that will be set to suit his own purpose, which is to make money. The lower the standard he can get accepted the better for his purpose. The natural tendency of an uncertain standard in contract work is downwards. The cure is in reasonable specification, and carrying it out.



The Architectural League of America grew out of thc new life that has come to architecture in recent years. It seems to be an integral part of that life and is expanding its operations so as to keep pace with the expansion of architectural effort, both in degree and in the kind of work, which is con

The Architectural League of America.

spicuous just now in the United States, as in England and the countries of Europe. The only Canadian body af1iliated with the League at present is the <assoc>Architectural 18 Club of Toronto</assoc>, a member of which, Mr<person>. J.

P. Hynes</person>, is chairman of one of the committees of the Club. There is no reason why the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc> and the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>should not become members of the League.' It is a question whether it would not bc to their advantage. From a material point of view there is the stimulation of the League's literature: reports on current civic improvement ; an illustrated volume compounded of illustrations of the best works exhibited in the local exhibitions ; and doubtless other developments in this direction ;—there are scholarships, for study in the architectural course of Harvard University, and a travelling scholarship ; there is a bureau for the formation of parties to travel and study in Europe, apart from scholarship winning. In many ways—in ways no doubt yet to be developed—the League is so active that we may fairly look to it to lead the way in American architecture. There is no doubt, however, that to follow such a lead is to follow in the direction of Americanization, and this word has not been one of entirely favourable import hitherto. At

-this moment we learn that the competition for the travelling scholarship is to be held on Easter Sunday, as a convenient day for getting the men together. This is Americanization and it is not worth following. It is this undue estimate, of the importance of material things and undue yielding to their pressure that is such a signal modern instance of the truth that the penalty upon us is to be satiated with our own ways. It is this that is making the world unpleasant to live in.



<article title=" TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL STUDIO CLUB " author="">TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL STUDIO CLUB. TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL STUDIO CLUB.

For several years the various efforts to institute architectural design classes in Toronto have not met with the success that should attend so important a phase of architectural education.

This year the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Studio Club </assoc>have made a very successful start in the right direction from which much good should result to the members themselves and to the profession generally. This club is the outcome of meetings called by the architects in December and has been organized and entirely supported by the draughtsmen with the assistance of Mr. <person>John M. Lyle </person>who is acting as patron of the club. Problems are conduct along Beaux-Arts Principles, being set and criticized, until completion by the Patron and the final awards made by a committee of architects.

The first problem resulted in seventeen very creditable designs, and following were the awards made

First mention. W. 13. <person>Van Egmond</person>.

Second mention.—<person>W. Somerville</person>, <person>Norman Anthony</person>, <person>John Tsuvoi</person>, <person>E. H. Yeigh</person>

"A Casino by the Seaside" is the subject of the second problem which is well under way and will be completed in April when an exhibition will be held of designs in both problems. It is the intention to start a new problem immediately on the completion of the present one, which will extend to the fall and will be splendid groundwork for next season when it is
