We make countless beautiful designs, with borders, friezes, dadosand every detail to match; they are easily applied, in old buildings over plaster, or in new ones where plaster is not required.

They are suited for every building where practical, durable beauty is desired in the

decorative finish, and are fire-proof and sanitary.

EXPENSIVE? Not at all. First cost is small. The plates are so carefully made they fit accurately.

We will give you an estimate if you send an outline showing shape and measurements of your ceilings and walls. Let us hear from you.
