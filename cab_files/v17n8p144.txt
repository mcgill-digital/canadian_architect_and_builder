There is some talk in Toronto of appointing a supervisor of elevators. With a view to furthering the security and safety of the thousands of people who daily patronize the elevators of New York, the Superintendent of Buildings of that city is now formulating a plan for inspecting, licensing and badging elevator men. In New York there are 6,000 elevators.

It is said that some one expressed in the presence of Cobden "the hope that some day all people might become intelligent enough to read Bacon." To this Cobden replied: "I would be happy indeed if the time ever came when all the working people could eat bacon." This was said some sixty or seventy years ago. The time has surely come when the working people not only eat bacon but also read Bacon.

Almost every day sees evidence of some new use for concrete. So vast are the uses that it has already been put to that to-day, as stated by the Canadian Manufacturer, we are walking on it, riding on t, eating our daily bread from grain stored in concrete elevators, taking our drinking water from concrete reservoirs and cisterns, living and doing business in houses constructed of concrete, sanitating our cities with sewers of concrete, and last, but not least, enterprising undertakers are offering us the opportunity of taking our final rest in concrete burial cases, deposited in concrete tombs, surmounted by concrete monuments, sacred to our evanescent memory.

The expectation that the present building season in Toronto would be entirely immune from strikes has met with disappointment. As this number goes to press building operations in that city are almost at a standstill consequent upon a strike of the union laborers for an increase of wages from 25 to 28 cents per hour, and the decision of the bricklayers' union to support the strikers by refusing to accept material from non-union laborers. The Builders' Exchange have positively declined to grant the laborers' demand, so there exists a deadlock, which unless broken, must seriously hamper business enterprise especially in the burned district, and spoil what would otherwise have been the most active building season in the history of the city. _________________________
