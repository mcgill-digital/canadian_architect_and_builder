DEFINITIONS FOR CEMENT USERS.



The following two important definitions for the use of the trade in the future were developed at the Chicago convention of cement manufacturers:

The term "Concrete" should never be used except when the composition described contains crushed rock pebbles or coarse gravel, combined with sand,. and where cement is used as a binder.

Where sand only is used together with cement, you should say a cement mortar block, a cement mortar brick, a cement mortar column, cap or lintel, as the case may be, and either of these may have the term "reinforced," should there be an iron or steel member inserted for the purpose of giving structural strength in either direction.
