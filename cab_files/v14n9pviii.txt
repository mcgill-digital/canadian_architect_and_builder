THE TORONTO ENGINEERS' CLUB.



The first meeting of the above club following the summer vacation, was held in the club rooms, King street west, on the evening of the 3rd inst. In the absence of the president, the chair was occupied by Major Gray.

Several new members were elected and other business transacted

A letter was read from the secretary of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers, stating that the proposed summer meeting at Buffalo had been abandoned owing to the few favorable replies received to the circular sent out to members.

Owing to the unavoidable absence of the author, the paper announced to be given by Mr. Cecil B, Smith, on '' Parks, Squares, and Drives for the City of Toronto," and the anticipated discussion thereof, was not forthcoming, but will probably form the chief feature of the programme of the next meeting to he held on the 1st of October.



Part III of Engineering Studies by Charles evan Fowler, M. Am. Sot-. C. E., published by the Engineering News Publishing Co. of New York, is devoted to descriptions and illustrations of some of the most celebrated stone arched bridges of England.
