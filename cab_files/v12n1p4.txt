	4	THE CANADIAN	ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



BUILDING OPERATIONS IN 1898.

IN reviewing a year ago the Canadian building operations for the year 1897, which it may be remembered were of a disappointing character, the opinion was expressed that 1898 would probably show to better advantage. This opinion is verified by the reports to hand of the results of thc year which has just closed. The extent of building enterprises is properly regarded as being a reliable barometer by which to measure the commercial condition of the country. Early in 1898 a substantial improvement began to be manifest in all branches of business. This improvement continued throughout the year. In sympathy therewith the building industry took on a degree of activity such as it had not previously experienced for several years. The revival was not confined to one or two particular localities, but extended to most of the leading cities in all the provinces of the Dominion. In Toronto, where for six or seven years unusual dullness had prevailed, the improvement was especially noticeable. '[he greater number of the buildings erected were residences of the better class. True, prices were much too low to allow of a fair margin of profit to contractors, the bulk of advantage being therefore reaped by the workmen, but should the improved conditions continue during the present year, as there is reason to anticipate, it may be that prices will advance to a more equitable standard.
