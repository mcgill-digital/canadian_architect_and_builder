The following report from the Council was read

<article title=" ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL " author="">ANNUAL REPORT OF THE COUNCIL,

GENTLEMEN,— At our annual meeting of October 10th 1890, your Council was instructed to procure an Act of Incorporation, also to deal with matters in relation to competitions. On the 30th of December last we succeeded in procuring an Act of Incorporation, a copy of which has been sent to every member of the Association. The Act stipulated that the Council meet within one month and re-organize, forming necessary by-laws, to be ratified at the next annual meeting.

On the 15th and 16th of January your Council met, organized. under the Act, and elected the officers that were elected at the last general meeting. They framed the by-laws and adopted them as sent to each member, and which are now open for amendment and ratification at this meeting.

Since the organization under the Act in regard to matters of competitions your Council after interviewing the <assoc>Building Committee of Montreal Board of Trade</assoc>, succeeded in having a few minor amendments made to the conditions prepared by the Building Committee, nevertheless, as the Building Committee did not accede to the more important items your Council found objectionable, they deemed it desirable to ask the members to refrain from engaging in the competition and with that view prepared a petition which was signed by about 20 members, a copy of which was sent the Building Committee of Board of Trade. Your Council have prepared a guide for competitions which will lie submitted later on at this meeting.

The Act sets forth that a tariff had to be prepared by the Council and sent down to the Lieutenant-Governor. The tariff as prepared will be read to you later. It has been sent to the Lieutenant-Governor, and now awaits his sanction.

The Board of Examiners elected at the meeting or January last consists of Messrs. <person>Berlinquet</person> and <person>Baillarge</person>, of Quebec. and <person>Roy</person>, <person>Thomas</person> and <person>Taylor</person>, of Montreal. They have framed program of subjects for examinations, which have been printed. Examinations were held by the Board of Examiners last 30th and 31st of July. Two students went up for matriculation and one for the final examinations. Those for matriculation succeeded in passing ; the one for registration was not equally successful. The officiating members of the Board were Messrs. Thomas, Roy and Taylor.

The Council has held 21 meetings. The attendance has been as follows:

—<person>J. W. Hopkins</person>, 18 ; <person>V. Roy</person>, 17 ; <person>A. Hutchison</person>, 17 A<person> F. Dunlop</person>, 19

<person>M.	Perrault</person>, 4; <person>A. Raza</person>, 14 <person>A. F. Taylor</person>, 18; <person>W. E, Doran</person>, 13 C.

Clift, 20. Quebec members—<person>F. X. Berlinquet</person>, ; <person>J. F. Peachy</person>, 2.

The Council have engaged rooms for the use of the members of the Association, one large room about 35' x 160" and a room for the Council adjoining. '[here is a large fire-proof vault and store room and all the necessary conveniences. The rooms are situated on the second floor at 186 Sm. James St., Montreal, and have been furnished with tables, chairs, etc. The lease is for three years from May next, but we have the option of leaving next May, provided the Council give the required three months notice. The rental is $200; the proprietor paying for cleaning, water, and all ordinary taxes. The rooms were formally opened on August 4th last. The Council have not yet succeeded in furnishing a library, but hope this will soon lie accomplished, as also the delivering of lectures and the forming of classes for the students.

'[here are seventy members on the roll and 41 students. There has been paid into the Association by its members and students the sum of $2,280 and there is still the sum of $100 owing by the members and students. Your Council last January when they organized, found it necessary to raise the registration fee to enable theta to meet the obligations incurred in procuring the Act, and yet later at time general meeting of the Association last May. it was again found necessary to assess each member the sum of $5.00 additional, thus making the registration fee $25.00. We are thankful to say that the members acceded to the request with alacrity, whereby your Council were enabled to meet all obligations, leaving a good balance in the Treasurer's hands. The Council take this opportunity of thanking the members for the handsome manner in which they have responded to all calls made upon them. All respectfully submitted on behalf of the Council.

Each member of this Association of Architects may be compared to a stone forming part of a structure; and as in a structure each stone has its allotted place and object, and all the stones being put together with harmony form something grand and imposing, so each member of this Association
