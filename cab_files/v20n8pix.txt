WILL MANUFACTURE CEMENT.

Several financial men of Toronto, it is said, have interested themselves in the Ben Allen Portland Cement Company, Limited, which will erect a large plant at Owen Sound or at Ben Allen, on the Grand Trunk Railway, four and a half miles from that town, where the marl and clay deposits are located. The company is capitalized at 











$500,000, of which $60,000 has been subscribed for in Owen Sound and vicinity. The

company plans to erect mills with a capacity of 600 barrels daily, with a view to extending operations to 1,000 barrels per day later on. The cement business in the Owen Sound district is assuming large proportions. The companies now there include the Owen Sound Cement Company at Shallow Lake, the Sun, Grey and Bruce, and Imperial at Owen Sound, which have a combined capacity daily of nearly 3,000 barrels.
