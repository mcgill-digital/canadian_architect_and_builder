The City Council of Montreal, have rescinded the resolution passed last year accepting the offer of $l50,000 by Mr. Carnegie towards the erection of a public library. The principal reason given for this action is that it is feared that in the selection of

The discovery has been announced by Mr. Maximilian Toch, a distinguished Chemist, that while structural steel is protected from rust when covered by cement containing only oxides, silicates and aluminates of lime, its corrosion is induced by contact with cement containing sulphites and sulphates. Plaster of Paris with which some of the foreign cements are said to he impregnated, also acts as a destructive agent.
