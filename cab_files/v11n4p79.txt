of boiler. For hot water heating for buildings there is no change in the construction of the boiler, the steam space being simply filled to the top with water. The fuel economy is the same as for steam purposes. The circulation of the water is the most direct that can be desired, as there is a continual uninterrupted rise from bottom to top of the boiler.

It requires only 6 1/2 feet in height. The brick casing is used

only for the return gases, and hence never requires renewing. As there is no fire-brick furnace to renew periodically, the repairs are reduced to an absolute minimum.

It is not necessary to refer to the exceptionally high evaporative economy of this boiler, as this could be readily predicted from its construction. The advertisement of this boiler will be found on another page.
