<article title="Estimating for Stone Work" author="">Estimating, as known by those who are conversant with the subject, is not a matter in which the haphazard or rule-of-thumb methods should be tolerated by contractors ; and yet, it can be safely stated that fully one-half of all the estimates made for stone are based on guesswork. In the absence of a correct system of collecting values, many contractors bid on work when the amount of their bid is excessively high or ridiculously low ; or if the bid should be near what it ought to be, it is more through accident than the result of a nicely wrought system which should enable them safely to determine the cost of production, if not exactly, so near to it that at all times, so far as their listed values are concerned, they can be as certain of their "net cost" being as nearly correct as under existing conditions it is possible to make it? And until a contractor is certain of this, he cannot, in these days of close competition be sure of how he stands with regard to a contract until all of the work is completed, all of the outstanding bills paid, and all moneys paid in connection with the work, which may be due him, collected ; and then he is apt to find that he has lost money on his contract, which is a fact that has been demonstrated only to often.

The writer has in mind the methods of some contractors that are not governed by the rules deduced from the science of bookkeeping ; but, rather, is the ever-ready system which they carry under their hats ! They require no system which entails the use of averages to enable them to figure closely on any work that may come before them, the result being that no man, however competent to do the work of estimating under the proper conditions, can ever hope to be able to fix the value of work during the absence of the contractor himself, whereas, under a proper system one qualified in every other respect to do the work as it should be done, would have no difficulty in estimating to the satisfaction of all concerned. In other words, the business would run itself, so far as relates to estimating, responsibility could be fixed to an absolute certainty, and the mental comfort resulting from a well organized system such as herein indicated, would more than repay the small amount of labor required to institute it. It is this class of contractors to whom this paper is addressed.

Following the completion of a contract in which a loss has been sustained, it is hut natural that a contractor should ask himself Who is to blame for this state of affairs, and how can it be avoided?

It is evident that a proper presentation of the subject demands that this question should be answered in its relation to the one who superintends the work, the one who figures the work and the contractor for whom the work is figured, inasmuch as all three either directly, or indirectly, affect the estimate ; and it is also evident to those who have given the matter serious thought, that the contractor himself is often to blame for poor work that is done in his office.

In order that a contractor may justly exact a prime quality of work from the one who he employes to do his estimating, he should endeavor to place at the command of the estimator every facility necessary to insure full and correct data, as well as to give him ample opportunity to study work in all stages of its production, and to keep thoroughly in touch with those whose duty it is to see that the work comes out to the best advantage, unless, perchance, the man who does the estimating should be the man that gets the work out, in which case

he would be in a position to watch the cost of production to a nicety. It is not possible for the contractor to secure the best service from the man in charge of the estimating in any other manner ; and he would do well to bear in mind that, with a man who is honest, and capable in other directions for assuming the responsibility of fixing the figure at which a contract shall be taken, he will best subserve his own interest by reposing full confidence in him as to all that relates to his work affording him full opportunity to post himself as necessity may require ; consuling with him fully at all stages in the preparation of an estimate ; and, in a sense, making him, for the time being one of the firm, in which the interest is mutual. In this way the estimator is encouraged to take the fullest interest in his work

will feel that his best efforts are thoroughly appreciated and, if there is no manhood lacking in his composition, can be relied upon by his employer to exert himself for the best interests of the firm. Failure to observe the principle involved in this statement has often resulted in heavy pecuniary losses to the contractor, in lost reputation to the estimator, who, perhaps, was thoroughly qualified to do his work safely had he not been compelled to work under adverse conditions.

Given the opportunity as outlined above, the contractor may reasonably expect that the estimator may be able to produce an estimate which shall represent the net cost of production and should understand that this estimate is governed solely by the cost of getting the work out in his own shop, whether it be higher or lower than that which may be expected from the shops of his competitors, as it is obvious that any difference in the cost of production in his shop, as compared with that of his competitors, is chargeable to the methods of operation in vogue in the shop, the degree of difficulty in working the material, as well as to the means of handling work which may be at the disposal of those charged with the conduct of operationsâ€”this under the assumption that his competitors, as we1l as himself, work along the lines indicated herein, according to a correct system. Insomuch as the contractor fails to observe these principles, he is justly blarneable for losses which may accrue from a failure to do so, always implying that all other requirements for the production of a correct estimate are not wanting in his shop.

An estimator who is thoroughly qualified to under take the task of fixing the value or net cost, of the stonework for a building, for instance, should, first of all, be a practical man ; and the more practical he is as a stone-cutter the more extensive his knowledge of the stone to be figured, and the working of it, the more valuable he is as an estimator. Indeed, without this experience and knowledge, all other qualifications necessary, too, in the estimator, become practically inoperative. In fact, outside of the simple, plain figuring, without practical knowledge which comes from the use of the tools and observation in the shop, and at the building, no person can honestly lay claims to being capable of producing an estimate which can be considered sate in any particular. Then the estimator must, as a prime requisite, be prepared to figure correctly from such units of value as may be gathered from the shop records, but he must also be ready and able, by reason of previous experience in a practical sense, to determine the values of such intricate or new work to which the shop records have no reference ; for, it is evident that only a man who is qualified through practical experience and trained obser
