attempt to elevate the standard of all the professions and callings. This extended even to the ranks of the anarchists, who recently placed a charge of dynamite under the School of Architecture at Madrid, but whose plans, like those of many other reformers, were frustrated and their enthusiasm dampened by a callous caretaker. (Laughter). The students were deeply grateful to those members of the 0. A. A. who had so disinterestedly sought to promote their welfare. The speaker pointed to the need of a better appreciation of the profession of architecture on the part of the public, and even of persons otherwise refined, and mentioned the case of a lady who was desirous that her son should enter one of the professions, and who brought him to an architect's office, with the remark that as he was somewhat deficient in education she had decided that he should become an architect. The speaker remarked that if the public glance could have rested on the bundle of papers required to be dealt with by the students at the recent examinations, and which, notwithstanding, were hut the first fragment of the knowledge to he acquired, they might conclude that some degree of erudition was necessary to the architect.

Some excellent songs were sung between the toasts by Messrs.

<person>J. Francis Brown</person>, <person>E. B. Jarvis</person>, <person>R. Wilson</person>, <person>J. J. Woolnough</person>, <person>Geo. Self </person>and <person>Mr. Thomes</person>. Mr. Woolnough also gave a piano solo, and Mr. Jas. Newton some well executed selections on the violin. A couple of recitations were given in creditable style by the President.

The assembly dispersed soon after midnight, having spent a thoroughly enjoyable and profitable evening.



<article title="A case of illicit commission" author="">A CASE	OF ILLICIT COMMISSION.



The Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>desire the publication of the following letter which has come into their possession:

To A. B. C., ESQ,

Architect.

DEAR SIR,—I have been accustomed while working under architects in ibis city, as welt as other places, to allow. a commission to those who use their influence in my behalf, while letting contracts on alterations, repairs, etc., that they may have in hand. I intended to speak to you on this mater while in your office this afternoon, hut failed to get you alone. I will he pleased to arrange matters between you and myself in this way, as I consider an architect and contractor can work together with profit to each other. The time has come when prices are so low that contractors require to scheme a little to come out square. My usual allowance has been five per cent. on all work and two and a half on all material. If these figures are worthy of any notice let us talk together. Yours truly,



Contractor.

It is this sort of thing the Association was originally designed expressly to prevent. The members of the Association are required to sign a declaration binding them to set their faces

against illicit commissions in their own practice, and now that the feeling of the profession has been actively enlisted in the matter, contractors who seek to "come out square" by this manner of proceeding will find, sooner or later, that it is not to their own advantage. ____________________

VI.



Mr<person>. F. W. W. DOANE</person>, City Engineer of Halifax, Nova Scotia, was born at Barrington, Shelbourne Co., N. S., on May 31st, 1863, his father being Capt. <person>Harvey Doane</person>, well known in his native province.

The subject of our sketch began engineering work in 1882. From 1883 to 1891 he was assistant to the provincial government engineer of Nova Scotia. During that time over $1,000,000 was expended on highway bridges. The work of the Department also included railway surveying and construction, water supply, sewerage, laying out, construction and repair of public roads, and reclamation of land from the sea. In 1886, Mr. Doane was sent out on the survey of the Musquodoboit Valley and Stewiacke Railway; in 1889, on the Carleton Bianch Railway and Western Shore Railway, and in 1890, on the Heatherton and Guysboro Railway and North Colchester Railway. In June, 1891, he was appointed City Engineer of Halifax, N. S. The duties embrace all kinds of city works, such as engineer and superintendent of water works, charge of public works, street grading, paving, repairs, &c., sewers, maintenance and repairs of city property, and all improvements.

Mr.. Doane has recently recommended the construction of new sewers estimated to cost $75,000 and submitted a report to the City Council on a scheme for improvement in the city water supply. A new 27" main is to be laid, new dams and gate houses constructed, and storage capacity increased 275,000,000 gallons. The improvements are estimated to cost $200,000. There have also been inaugurated extensive street and sidewalk improvements, which it is

expected will add greatly to the

appearance and reputation of

the city.

In co-operation with the Board of Health, the Engineer is thoroughly reforming the plumbing system and sanitary arrangements of the whole city (of which there was very urgent need).

Mr. Doane is probably the

youngest member of the <assoc>Canadian Society of Civil Engineers</assoc>.

He has been a member of the Council of the Institute of Halifax since 1888 and is likewise a member of the Faculty of Pure and Applied Science of Dalhousie College and University, being lecturer on civil engineering and surveying.

The supplemental examination for conditioned candidates will be held in next September.

It is not proposed in future years to admit candidates for the final examinations to a supplemental examination. On this occasion, as many of the students presenting themselves for the final examination have been obliged to wait for the instruction of the examinations, and so have served terms longer than required by the Association, the council has appointed a supplemental in order that the candidates may be hindered as little as possible in proceeding to practice.

Mr. <person>A. Dubrueil</person>, architect, has removed from No. 1639 Notre Dame street to No. 1608 on the same Street.

THE <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects </assoc>in a communication to the City Clerk, urges the importance of the office of sanitary inspector, and the consequent necessity for caution in the selection of a competent person to fill the position.

<assoc>L'Association de Secours des Ouvriers</assoc>, is applying for letters of incorporation, with the object of assisting workmen or workwomen who through misfortune are unable to provide for their own maintenance. Applicants for such assistance must furnish if required a certificate of good behavior. The capital stock of the Association is to be $12,000. A number of prominent Montreal contractors are interested in the movement.
