the same firm have a colored elevation of a store for Messrs. <firm>Robinson & Co</firm>., which exhibits a quaint originality of treatment. The tone of red brick suggested is not quite happy— the less so as there is nothing to suggest joints or agreeable surface texture. Messrs. <firm>Ross & Macfarlane</firm> have two drawings—a design for a new library at Bishop's College School, Lennoxville, and the new office building for the <person>Dominion Guarantee Co</person>.—pleasant drawings in black and white, with a faint suggestion of color. Messrs. <firm>Castle & Son </firm>send three designs for interiors, which suffer from the huge scale on which they are drawn. They might look well at a greater distance than it is possible to get in the little room where they hang. Mr. <person>Louis Farey </person>has four designs for interior treatments. Those that follow on the historical styles, though not in all cases in strict accord with history) are pleasing and compare favorably with the more original design for an ingle-nook. <person>Mr. Mitchell </person>has some careful sketches of Melrose Abbey. <person>Mr. Rickson</person>

<person>A.	Outhet </person>has a couple of garden designs—the one in perspective is pleasantly treated, but the garden paths, being white, can hardly be true to reality, and the circumstances impoverish the effect of the drawing.

On the 14th of March, Prof. <person>C. W. Colby</person>, of the chair of history at McGill University) gave a lecture before the above Club, taking as his subject ''Brunelleschi." The lecturer illustrated tile remarkable character of this grave and gentle Florentine) who turned the stream of architecture into the renascence channels which had been in part prepared for it by the general change of sentiment and study of the age. Trained at first,

like so many of the great artists of the period, in the workshop of a goldsmith, Brunelleschi tried one art after another without distinguished success. Foreseeing that the problem of covering with a dome the great cathedral then rising in the midst of Florence, would require a knowledge and resource no architect in the city then possessed, he sold his small estate and journeyed to Rome to study night and clay, in order that when the hour should come tile man should not be wanting. After fourteen years unremitting study in Rome, lie returned to Florence when the question of the dome was being agitated. He alone could speak with confidence in tile matter. Envy, greed and mistrust barred his way; but that course that the master had set, when he started for Rome so many years before, he was to steer successfully to the end. The dome was a triumph and is the glory t the Florentines On the slab that marks Brunelleschi's place of rest in the cathedral is the simple inscription "Philippus Architector.' Philip,'' for one name suffices for the great and well beloved; and in the shadow of that great dome he is the architect.''

On the 21st of March, <person>Mr. Lemasnie </person>spoke on the subject of 'The Composition of Natural and Conventional Forms.' By the medium of sketches on the blackboard, Mr. Lemasnie illustrated the simple lines which form the basis of ornamental design, tracing the same underlying principles in the conventional forms of architecture and in the animate forms of nature. In conclusion, he strongly recommended the study of plaint life and other phases of nature as a means of infusing freshness and enjoyment into our ideas of design.
