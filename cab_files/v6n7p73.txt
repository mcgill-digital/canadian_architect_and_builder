THERE has just been published by the direction of the General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church in Canada, a pamphlet of nearly forty pages containing illustrations accompanied by brief descriptions of designs suitable for Country, village and town churches. Most of the designs are reproductions of drawings submitted in the recent Presbyterian church competition. Although they cannot all be declared to he satisfactory examples of church design, the excellence of some is such as to encourage the hope that they will in a measure serve the object the church had in view in their publication, viz., improvement in the design of rural churches. The authorities of the Presbyterian church deserve commendation for the attempt they have made to improve our church architecture. It is to be hoped the result of their first modest effort will prove so satisfactory that at some future time they will feel encouraged to carry their purpose a step farther.





THE ingenuity of the impecunious and dishonest contractor is truly wonderful, and when aided by that of an unscrupulous lawyer, is well nigh certain to succeed in defrauding persons unaccustomed to doing business in other than a straightforward manner. A contractor and lawyer of this description have been practising of late in Toronto, and have succeeded in delrauding a number of supply firms and sub-contractors. The lawyer writes a letter stating that the contractor is about to secure through him a loan, and that he will control its distribution. The impression is conveyed that the lawyer will assume responsibility for the payment out of the loan of claims for material and labor required by the contractor in the carrying out of his Contract. The letter is, however, so skillfully worded that while it has in several instances obtained for the contractor the material and help he required, the supply firms and sub-contractors who subsequently brought suit against the lawyer were unable to recover their claims. It is hoped that this expose may assist in putting a check on such crooked practices.





THE difficulty of securing the title to the land required for the proposed union railroad depot at Toronto, which has been the means of delaying for nearly a year construction on the building, at last appears to have been overcome, and the work is to be proceeded with at once. In the present inactive condition of building enterprise it is. satisfactory to learn that this important undertaking, which will absorb both labor and material to a considerable extent, is to go forward during the present season. In this connection we must express our regret that apparently no advantage is to be taken of the favorable circumstances at present existing for permanently improving the appearance of the water front. The shabby old wooden structures which occupied a portion of the site required for the new depot, instead of being torn down and forever banished from sight, have been permitted to be removed out to the line of the new street which it is proposed to construct as a promenade at the water side. The city authorities should determine to get rid of these and as many as possible of the other old buildings which for years have disfigured the city front and falsely impressed strangers visiting it for the first time by boat or train. Has the idea of a small park on the water front been abandoned? We trust not. The opportunity now exists for establishing such a park or garden, which would do much to make the city front attractive and afford a pleasant resting place for persons having to wait for boats or trains, as well as those who would wish occasionally to enjoy a half hour beside the water without being obliged to spend effort, time and money to go across to island

park.	____________________







With many others we indulged the hope that the disgraceful revelations brought to light a couple of years ago of bribery and fraud on the part of government officials and contractors for public works, would suffice to purify the methods of these classes of persons in the future Unfortunately in this hope we have been disappointed by the evidence which has lately been given before the Commission appointed by the Government to investigate the expenditures and circumstances connected with the erection of the new railway bridge across the Lachine canal at Montreal. The investigation was ordered when the fact became known that the estimated cost of the work,
