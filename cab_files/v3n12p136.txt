The discussion of the excellent menu engaged the full attention of the company for upwards of an hour, when the toast list was entered upon, the health of Her Majesty the Queen being followed by the singing of the National Anthem.

Mr. Curry in proposing the toast of Canada" said he was glad to know that this toast was taking its proper place at our social gatherings. It was a right thing that they should remember always that they were Canadians. (Applause). If they expected ever to be a great country and a great people, they must think well of themselves. There was a too prevalent idea on the part of some of our citizens to look upon Canada as an inferior place. If those people thought this a poor country, why did they stay here? Unfortunately this question had become in some respects a p political one. There were to-day in Canada two parties, both of which claimed to be loyal to the country. Possibly they were. But it must be admitted that there was on the part of one a desire to win place and power by more or less disparaging our country That should be discountenanced by every true Canadian. Country should be put before party every time He was sorry to observe that Sir <person>Richard Cartwright </person>spoke recently of Canada as a breeding ground to furnish men for the United States, and that he said that one million Canadians were citizens of the United States, Of course Sir Richard claimed that the National Policy was to blame for this, though that was a question not to be argued on the present occasion He believed that fewer of our people would leave Canada if they were given the opportunities they should receive. It was well enough for Sir Richard Cartwright to say that Canadians can win high positions on the other side, but it was a strange thing that if that was so they could not succeed at home. It was the old story of a prophet not without honour save in his own country As Canadians. we should stick up for our own country. Even if it were a barren land we should be proud of it. but much more so when it was the fact that few countries could compare with this He did not think there was a people that stood more by their country than the Scotch, and yet there were many finer lands. Who ever saw a Scotchman sneer at his country? The Scotchman loves the highlands—especially the Highlander. (Applause and laughter.) As Canadians we should be always Canadian We should never think it a clever thing to rim down our country It might be true that we are not so progressive as some other people in some ways, and possibly that was an advantage. (Applause). Canada had shown a remarkable amount of progress. We have the best canal system in the world and the best railway system. Nothwithstanding that some parties said the C. P. Railway would never earn sufficient to pay for the axle grease, the company was able to pay a dividend upon the enormous capital required to build the road We must try to develop a national spirit We must develop our resources. It will never do for us to be simply producers of crude materials for our neighbors. By that means we might become wealthy, but we would never become an independent people. To develop national life, we should encourage art, for the love of the beautiful had much to do with the formation of character. We should strive to be just as cultured as any people. Canada had no reason to be ashamed of her men of letters, although at one time it was declared that we could never have a national literature, and the time must come when art will also occupy a high place. He asked the company to dnnk to the Prosperity of Canada."

The toast was drunk with great enthusiasm, and was followed by the singing of The Maple Leaf."

The Chairman announced that the next toast was that of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>." He coupled with this the name of the Secretary, Mr. S. H. Townsend. He regretted that Mr. Storm was unable to attend. He read the following reply which had been received to the invitation to the President:

Mr. Storm regrets exceedingly that an important engagement made some days ago will deprive him of the pleasure of attending the Toronto Architectural Sketch Club supper He desires at the same time to express his appreciation of the honour done him by the kind invitation, and to convey his best wishes for the success of the Club and the prosperity of the individual members thereof.

Mr. Townsend replying to the toast, which had been very heartily received, thanked the company for the way they had honoured the toast and regretted that Mr. Storm was unable to be present to reply. It had been well said by Mr. Curry that as Canadians we should be proud of our country After having seen a great deal of the world he was of opinion that Canada had reason to be proud of her architects. The best buildings in the country were the work of Canadians. (Applause). There was a feeling among a certain class of the community that Canada could not produce architects. The buildings which this country could show were a sufficient refutation of that statement. Canadians could point to Toronto University as the work of a native which could compare favorably with anything on the continent. Many of our other buildings of less import were not inferior in architectural beauty and utility to any that could be pointed out on this continent.

<person>Mr. Samuel Jones</person>. —The Bank of Montreal is a Darling. (Laughter).

Mr. Townsend was glad to be able to say that Canada was the first country to recognize the architect legally and give him a standing. The Act of Incorporation did not give the architects all they desired, but enough to make a good start upon He had no doubt that in the future they would be able to get additional legislation which would place the profession in the position it should occupy. With this in view it became the members of the profession to strive to elevate their ideas of professional honor and to train themselves for the high position they were destined to occupy. (Applause).

The Chairman, in proposing the next toast-"Sister Societies—welcomed the representatives of the <assoc>Students Art League </assoc>who were present. He would ask Mr. Thomson, president of the League, and Mr. Jones, the secretary, to respond. The League deserved a considerable amount of praise. They were a society composed of young men who had banded

themselves together for the object of studying art and learning how to draw. I his Art League was largely the outcome of Toronto's lack of an Art School If Toronto had an Art School the Art League would never have come into existence. Fortunately, we had such a League, and it was doing a good work. It was to be hoped, notwithstanding. that Toronto would soon have an efficient Art School. In the past the Art School had done harm rather than good, and it was a matter of congratulation that the state of the present organization was such that it was practically dead. He wished the Art League every success.

Mr. Thomson, in responding, recognized in the Sketch Club co-workers with the Art League. They were both part of the art training system which the young men of Toronto were building up. The Sketch Club was the outgrowth of an idea that was germinated in the Art League. He hoped the two organizations would work together harmoniously and for their mutual benefit. The development of national feeling, as had been pointed out by the President, was a great want in this country. If it was true that Canada was supplying men to the United States it was a high compliment to this country. But why did such a state of things exist There was very little here to keep the young men in the country. The Government did not encourage art, but gave a paltry grant of $400 a year to this important branch of education. To illustrate the way Canadians were appreciated abroad he mentioned the fact that a young Canadian had been sent to Europe by he architects of the World's Fair, Chicago, fur the purpose of selecting the best ideas for the construction of the necessary buildings It was a mistake for the Government not to educate the people to appreciate art. Let them do this and encourage national feeling and the young men would not be compelled to go abroad.

Mr. Samuel Jones said that if the Architectural Sketch Club sprang from the Art Students' League the babe had become bigger than its father. This was another example of the national vitality of the Canadian character and of its ability to get there.' There was in this country a better element to work upon than in the United States or the old land. He was sorry that politicians were more inclined to copy the evils of the old world than to copy the advantages. The sudden growth of the Sketch Club was proof of the future that was in store for art. Out of evil comes good, and Out of the want of an Art School had sprung these two organizations. It should not be long before they should join their forces and see that there is established in this city a Government Art School worthy of the name. In the coming contest with the authorities to re-establish the school upon a proper basis lovers of art look with confidence for the assistance of the Architectural Sketch Club and the Art Students' League. Although we have good material to work upon, it is necessary to success that we should obey the economic laws. There was no use breeding architects or painters if the public taste for their work was not cultivated. It was a lasting disgrace that in a civilized community like this art was at so low an ebb. A young man would not stop in Canada even from patriotic motives when by going abroad his work was better appreciated and he received better pay for it. There must he a new missionary crusade. We want such a man as Ruskin to inspire us to go out as missionaries among the plutocratic aristocrats and teach them art. Here in Toronto the best pictures were sold at too low a figure. The highest class of pictures were sold at a much less profit than the worst class. The people pretended to want art—they simply wanted art pretence. They would rather pay three-quarters of a dollar for veneer than one dollar for solid mahogany. He was more than shocked at what was called the civilization of the United States. They knew little of art, and their lives were spent in a fevered haste in trying to scrape into their own pockets somebody else's dollars. He was glad to know that the women were taking an interest in art, and warned the architects that they would have to look to their laurels as the other sex would be invading their sphere (Applause)

The Chairman then invited the company to fill their glasses and drink to the " Building Interests."

Mr. <person>G. Moir </person>in responding assured those present that the builders were not so bad a set as some people would make them out to be. There was a feeling entertained by a few that the builders were little better than rogues. and that they must be well looked after all the time. He thought that was not quite true.

A voice—The builders are bricks.

Mr. Moir had found from an experience of 20 years that when a builder did right he would not have much trouble with the architects. He was glad to be able to say that nearly all the finest structures in the city were the work of native builders. Contractors were glad to do good work when the architects supplied good designs, which the architects, of course, always did. The Builders' Society had tried to secure the adoption of a new form of tender but they had not succeeded very well so far Some firms would agree to the proposal, but others would not. He hoped that eventually they would arrive at an agreement From the intellectual faces he saw around him he was sure that the architects of the future would not be inferior to those of the present.

Mr. <person>John Ritchie </person>also replied by singing "Jack's Yarn.'

Mr. <person>Joseph York </person>said that the labour question often gave the builders a great deal of trouble. Sometimes a labor difficulty often led to great pecuniary loss. He would like to see an uniform tender adopted that would be satisfactory to all. The buildings of Toronto compared very favorably with those he had seen anywhere else. He hoped that as time went on Canadians would have more money to expend on buildings.

The Chairman said that as to the quality of buildings in Toronto he believed it was superior to tbat of any city on the continent The average building in Toronto was a great deal better than the average building in any city in the United States. Look at the Auditorium in Chicago and you will find the jambs so crooked that you could see the defect across a ten acre field Even in the Library at Boston there were defects. It was astonishing that expensive buildings in the United States were finished in such a rough and ready way. The builders of Toronto were deserving of a great deal of credit, and the responsible builders were desirous of giving full return for every cent they received. They were not all like this He met one builder who told him that it was the architects business to see that the builder did his work, and the builder's business to see that he did not. (Laughter). He did not believe in that. If the architect was to be turned into a detective, it would make the work very expensive. The contractor in the present state of the labor market had a difficult task. It was well enough to say when workmen were dissatisfied, "get others," but that simply meant to get others just as bad.

The Chairman then proposed the toast of "Our Guests," and called upon Mr. <person>J. P. Murray </person>to reply.

Mr. Murray said he was glad that the architects were taking an interest in art. The object of the present gathering was that they might do some interior decoration. (Laughter.) He had been glad to hear the patriotic remarks of the Chairman. He was proud of being a Canadian—an Irish Canadian and a British Canadian. He thought architects would do well to see that sky windows were made so that they could be more easily handled
