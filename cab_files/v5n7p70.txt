<doctype type="text">	70	CANADIAN	AND BUILDER July, 1892



<article title="the Lates W.T. Thomas" author="">THE LATE W. T. THOMAS.

MR. <person>W. T. Thomas</person>, the well known architect, who died at his late residence, 119 Mackay Street, Montreal, on the 26th ult., was the son of the late <person>Wm. Thomas</person>, architect, of Toronto, who came to this country in 1844, settled in Toronto and was one of the leading architects in the west, and a pioneer of Gothic architecture in Canada, and even on this Continent. His brother, the late John Thomas, won wide distinction as a sculptor and architect, having been chosen by Sir <person>Charles Barry</person>, the architect of the Houses of Parliament at Winchester, to execute the statuary about that building.

The subject of this sketch inherited the family ability, and studied under his father the profession of which he proved himself a master. Mr. Thomas went to Montreal about the year 1864, and for a short time practised in partnership with his brother, Mr. <person>C. P. Thomas</person>, now of Chicago, and subsequently in his own name, rising at once to the first rank among his confreres.

<building>St. George's Church in Montreal</building>, and <building>Trinity Church, St. John, N. B</building>., (both won in open competition), are perhaps the best examples of his genius in

Church building, but the many churches which he designed elsewhere, also bear evidence of his ability. Mr. Thomas did not, however confine himself entirely to ecclesiastical architecture, as he executed among other buildings in Montreal<building>, the Caverhill block  Montreal</building>on St. Peter Street, and the houses of the late <person>Thomas Workman</person>, <person>Lord Mount Stephen </person>and Mr. <person>Duncan McIntyre</person>, the <building>Prescott Town Hall </building>and other buildings throughout the country.

The deceased gentleman leaves a widow, the daughter of the late <person>John Hancock</person>, barrister, of Montreal, and two sons who are studying their father's profession. His funeral took place on the 28th ult. the pall bearers being chosen from the members of the profession in Montreal, viz: <person>J. A. Hopkins</person>, R. C. A.; <person>A. G. Fowler</person>; <person>A. F. Dunlop</person>, R. C. A. <person>; J. J. Brown</person>; <person>James. Wright</person>; <person>W. McLea Walbank.

</person>5.	Competitions should be conducted in one of the following ways

(A)	By advertisement, inviting architects willing to compete for the intended work to send in designs. The promoters, with the advice of the assessor or accessors, should make their selection for such designs. The author of the design awarded the first place should be employed to carry out the work.

(B)	By advertisement, inviting architects willing to compete for the intended work to send in their names by a given day, with such other information as the candidate may think likely to advance his claim to be admitted to the competition. From these names the promoters, with the advice of the assessor or assessors, should select: (a) an architect to carry out the work or (b) a limited number to compete, and each competitor thus selected should receive a specified sum for the preparation of his design. The author of the design awarded the first place should be employed to carry out the work.

(c)	By personal invitation to a limited number of selected architects to join in a competition for the intended work. Each competitor should receive a specified sum for the preparation of

his design. The author of the design awarded the first place should be employed to carry out the work.

6.	No design shall bear any motto, device or distinguishing mark, but all designs should be numbered by the promoters in order of receipt. Any attempt to influence the decision of the promoters, or of the assessor or assessors, should disqualify a competitor.

7.	In every case the amount of premium or remuneration for the competitive designs should be fixed by the promoters, acting under the advice of the assessor or assessors, and should be paid in addition to the usual professional charges for carrying out the work.

8.	Where a deposit is required for supplying the instructions, it should be returned on the receipt of a bona fide design, or if the applicant declines to compete and returns the said instructions within a month after their receipt.

COMPETITIONS.

COMPETITIONS.

SANCTIONED BY THE ROYAL INSTITUTE OF BRITISH ARCHITECTS.



I.	The promoters of an intended competition should, as their first step, appoint one or more professional assessors, architects of established reputation, whose appointment should be published in the original advertisements and instructions, and whose decision should govern the selection of the designs.

All designs sent in should be submitted to the assessors.

2.	The duty of assessors should be:

(a)	To draw up the particulars and conditions as instructions to competitors, and to advise upon the question of cost.

(b)	To determine which of the designs conform to the instructions, and to exclude all others.

(c)	To advise the promoters on the relative merits of the designs admitted to the competition, and to make a selection in accordance with the conditions.

3.	Every promoter of a competition and every assessor engaged upon it should abstain absolutely from competing and from acting as architect for the proposed work.

4.	The number and scale of the required drawings should be distinctly set forth, and they should not be more in number, or to a larger scale, than necessary to clearly explain the designs. If perspective views be required, it should be so stated, and they should be uniform in scale, number, mode of coloring, etc.

(a)	If sent in after the period named (accidents in transit excepted).

(b)	If it does not substantially give the accommodation asked for.

(c)	If it exceeds the limits of site, as shown on the plan issued by the promoters, the figured dimensions on which should be adhered to until officially altered.

(d)	If the assessor or assessors should determine that its probable cost will exceed the outlay stated in the instructions, or the estimate of the competitor, should no outlay be stated provided always that, should the assessor or assessors not have been consulted in the first instance respecting the cost, as recommended in paragraph a of Clause 2, and should he or they be of opinion that the outlay stated in the instructions is inadequate for the proper execution of the proposed works, the assessor or assessors shall not be bound in the selection of a design by the amount named in such instructions, but the question of cost shall, nevertheless, be a material element in the consideration of the award.

(e)	If any of the other instructions are violated.

10.	It is desirable that all designs submitted in a competition, except any excluded under Clause 9, should, with the consent of their authors, be publicly exhibited after the award has been made, which award should be published at the time of exhibition.

11.	The architect whose design may be selected as the best
