MONS. H. LE CHATETIER, a French scientist, has recently succeeded in producing marble from pure calcined carbonate, This substance in the form of an impalpable powder, was enclosed in a steel cylinder and compressed between two steel pistons with a pressure of 1,000 kilogrammes per square centimeter. While in this condition, a platinum spiral previously embedded in the powder, was heated by an electric current, with the result that the powder in the neighborhood of the wire was rendered crystalline and translucent. Sections of the resulting substance when examined under the microscope exhibited the characteristics of certain specimens of slightly marled marble. This achievement though it may be useless from an economic point of view is none the less interesting.



THE storm which a few weeks ago passed over Ontario, and was the cause of great destruction of property, may be taken as an illustration of the fact previously adverted to that provision should be made by architects and builders in the erection of their buildings to resist the increased wind pressures to which apparently buildings in this country are likely to be subjected in the future. In the storm to which we have referred, the spire of a Toronto church was carried away, and the vibration of some of the buildings used for business purposes was so great as to cause serious alarm to the persons employed therein. There seems to have come a change in the climatic conditions of this country of which more violent wind storms are a feature, and their influence upon buildings should not be lost sight of by those who design them.



THE subject of the water supply of the city of Toronto has been one of general interest for many years past, more particularly during the last two years, within which a number of accidents have occurred to the water works plant, resulting indeterioration of the quality of the supply. The question as to what should be done to improve the supply and perfect the system, has been widely discussed, and numerous have been the theories advanced. The idea that water of much greater purity is obtainable at Lake Simcoe, and that it could be conveyed by gravitation to Toronto more cheaply than the necessary supply could be pumped from Lake Ontario by the existing method, is one which has apparently taken a firm hold on the minds of some of the citizens. The advocates of this idea argue that not only could water for drinking and other domestic purposes be supplied, of better quality and more cheaply, by this method, but also that power could be developed to operate all the manufacturing establishments of the city, as well as light the streets. These views were promulgated by one of the mayoralty candidates at the last municipal election. Whether or not the startling nature of the proposal had anything to do with his defeat, we have no means of knowing; certain it is, however, that the theory is not backed up by any engineering authority. The fact has been demonstrated that the water of Lake Simcoe is in no respect superior in quality to that of Lake Ontario, This is one of the important features in the case. Another is, that in the opinion of the City Engineer of Toronto, a tunnel can be constructed for half a million dollars which will ensure a supply of water sufficient for the needs of half a million people, while the means of bringing water from Lake Simcoe would cost millions. The height of land lying between Lake Simcoe and Toronto, would necessitate about twelve miles of tunnelling, the cost of which in itself would be enormous. As to the advantage of the scheme for power purposes, it is an undisputable fact that power can be produced cheaper by steam engines on the ground.
