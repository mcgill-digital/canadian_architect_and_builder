<article title=" TO PHOTOGRAPH BLUE Prints " author="">TO PHOTOGRAPH BLUE Prints.

Blue prints may be photographed, it is suggested by H. H. Supple, by. first bleaching the print in a dilute solution of ammonia and then immersing it in a weak solution of tannic acid. A few drops or say, half a teaspoonful, of ammonia in a glass of water is enough for the first solution and heaping teaspoonful of dry tannic acid powder in a glass of water for the second. This treatment will bring out the drawing in nonactinic red, and a photograph of it will give a negative having black lines on clear glass. This can be backed with white paper and used for copy in the photo engraving process.
