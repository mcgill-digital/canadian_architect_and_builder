<doctype type="text">MONTREAL may be called with some appropriateness, in a few years <article title="Correspondence - Montreal" author="">from now, the City of Monuments, if their number continues to grow out in the same proportion they have been during the last few years.

Two of these monuments having been unveiled recently, the readers of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER will forgive me if I take advantage of the actuality of the subject to bring the same before their notice.

Amongst the monuments and memorials the Maisonneuve Monument stands foremost and unrivalled by anything yet erected in the city. It is not that it is the tallest or the most costly, as it is not these alone that are capable of producing a work of art, but it is the refinement of the whole, the agreeableness of the outline and the elegance of the details, which are yet very simple.

The statue stands on a pedestal of granite, having a low buttress at each of its four corners, on which are placed groups of figures, representing Closse accompanied by his dog, and Lemoine, two early settlers of the Ville Marie; Jeaune Mauce represented while attending a wounded young Indian, and an Indian of the tribe of the Iroquois, with which Maisonneuve often had trouble. On each of the four sides of the pedestal are bas-reliefs, the one facing Notre Dame Church representing the signature of the act constituting the foundation of Ville Marie, the one facing the Ontario Bank the exploit of Place d'Armes, the one facing the Bank of Montreal the heroic death of Dollard at the Long Sault, and the side facing the New York Life building the celebration of the first religious service on the island.

The cost of the monument has been about $25,000, nearly half of which has been subscribed by the municipal government and the balance by citizens of the city.

The Macdonald Memorial unveiled shortly before the Maisonnouve Monument, might no doubt be comparable, in respect to its sculpture, to the Place d'Armes monument, but from an architectural point of view it utterly fails to provoke that agreeable sensation and satisfaction one feels when passing by the down-town monument.

The aspect of the whole is of a triumphal arch, standing on a high pedestal with its two side doorways omitted, and as an architect of some note remarked to me a few days ago, crowned by a candlestick holder. The memorial bears no inscriptions of any kind, with the exception of the name of the great statesman honored by its erection.

The roof is crowned by four lions, and over these by allegorical



figures representing the seven provinces of the Dominion, holding a



shield bearing the coat of arms of each of the Provinces. The total



cost of the memorial was about $35 000



Another of the monuments also recently erected is a granite obelisk,. measuring about 35 feet heavenward, on Foundling street, near Place Royale, in commemoration of the founders of Montreal. The obelisk is perfectly plain, with no sculpture or bronze work, with the exception of the plates hearing the inscriptions, one of which reads as follows

The <assoc>Historical Society of Montreal </assoc>is an institution deserving encouragement from all citizens and true patriots, for it is a noble task that it is pursuing. Although the field is not vast in a comparatively young country as ours, we should not lose sight of the great good derived from similar institutions in Europe, and especially in France.

Another monument, and the last I have to chronicle here, is Dr. Chenier's Monument, one of the agitators of 1837â€”38 which is now in course of erection in Viger Gardens. The foundations are now level with the ground, and it is expected to have it completed this summer.

regretting inability to send delegates to the convention of the <assoc>National Association of Plumbers of the United States</assoc>, held in Philadelphia recently, after which Mr. <person>John Date </person>was called upon to give an account of his visit to the convention. He was courteously received by the American brethren and found their meetings interesting. About 397 delegates were present, as well as a number of visitors. It was moved by Mr. Gordon, seconded by <person>Mr. Sexton</person>, that the thanks of the association he conveyed to Mr. Date for his services, which was carried unanimously.



After considerable discussion among the members, it was resolved to suspend the regular meetings of the association until September, leaving to the Executive Committee all business arising during the interval, but should it he found necessary, a special meeting may be called at any time.



The hope of those engaged in the building trades has been deceived, for although the outlook last spring for this season's work was satisfactory enough, it appears that, notwithstanding the improvement recorded in trade in general, speculators and money investors are more cautious and prudent than previously, and do not wish to launch themselves in any undertaking of importance until the complete revival of business is assured.

The only buildings of any importance being built this year number only two, the Canada Life building at the corner of St. Peter and St. James streets, which has now reached its third story, and the <building>Bell Telephone Co.'s building</building>, at the corner of Notre Dame and St. John streets, which has just been commenced.

We regret to announce the death, on the 10th inst., of Mr. <person>Warden King</person>, senior member of the firm of <firm>Warden King & Son, Montreal</firm>, and one of the most prominent business men of that city. He had been to somewhat delicate health for some time past, but serious results were not anticipated until a short time previous to his death. Mr. King was born in Scotland in 1823, being 72 years of age at the time of his death. In 1852 he entered into business with the late Mr. Rogers, as hardware manufacturers and iron founders, the firm being known as <firm>Rogers & King</firm>. After Mr. Rogers' death, Mr. Jas. C. King became a partner, and under the name of Warden King & Son the business has since been successfully carried on, the Chanteloup estate being recently purchased by them. In religion Mr. King was a Presbyterian, being the oldest elder in Erskine church, and one of the founders of the Y. M. C. A. He was a Conservative, but took no prominent part in politics.

A writer in one of the English architectural papers gives what lie terms "a very simple method of rendering a wood factory building of greater resistance to fire." It consists in filling the spaces between the studding with "a grout made of sand, lime and a large proportion of sawdust, mixed with water to flow slowly. It becomes quite hard ; is a poor conductor of heat, and will not ignite, though it is charred by exposure to an intense fire. This applies to a building already constructed, where it would he a difficult task to remove the sheeting or lath and
