BOOK REVIEWS.

 "Modern Practical Carpentry,'' by George E His, published by B. T. Batsford. 94 High Holborn, London, England. Price, 12s. 6d. the author of this work, who, by the way. is author of ''Modern Practical Joinery.'' has gone very much into detail in describing the best methods of doing all classes of ''practical'' carpentry, lie is of the opinion that a sufficient number of hooks have been published treating the theoretical side of the question, and has therefore paid special attention to the practical side. The book is not written for trained carpenters alone, but can be thoroughly understood by the novice as well. The work is profusely illustrated and contains 375 pages.



The Ellis Marble Quarry, Tweed, Ont., which has been closed nearly all winter, has been reopened, and operations will be carried on steadily through the summer. It is being operated by the Roman Stone Company, of Toronto, who have some large  contracts in hand. It is expected that the material will be shipped at the rate of a car load per day, which will necessitate the employment of from ten to fifteen men. The material is mixed with cement and used instead of cut stone in some of the larger and better class of buildings.
