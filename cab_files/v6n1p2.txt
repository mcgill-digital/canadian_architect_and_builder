VOL. VI.

FIVE years ago the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER was launched on the journalistic sea as the representative of the architectural, engineering and building interests of this country The present New Year Number is intended to mark its safe passage through the shoals which at the outset usually endanger and often wreck the lives of ventures of this character. A comparison of this with the initial number, will suffice to indicate progress which has been made. While it is a matter of gratification that many of the crudities which marked the earlier numbers have disappeared, we are conscious that perfection is yet far distant, and the realization of this fact will prompt to constant endeavor in the direction of the ideal.

Our sincere thanks are extended to every person who has assisted us to achieve the present standard, and we hope for a continuance of their aid in the future. Especially would we acknowledge the assistance given us in the production of present number. To Messrs. <person>Darling</person>, <person>Sproatt</person> and <person>Pearson </person>we are indebted for the design for front page of cover, to Mr. Henry Simpson for frontispiece, and to the authors of the special articles on numerous subjects appearing in this issue. Nor would we omit mention of the manufacturing and supply firms, whose enterprise and liberality are abundantly manifest, and who are deserving of reward at the hands of architects and builders, who are extensive users of the materials which they offer.

We trust that to all connected with the building interests 1893 may fulfil the present indications of a prosperous year.



THE address of the President of the R. I. B. A. at the opening session for 1892-3, covers four closely printed pages of The Builder, and deals with a variety of subjects, including Draughtsmanship, Architects' Education, Examinations, Qualification of Fellows, The Institute's Publications, Capital and Labor, The Chicago Exhibition, Preservation of Ancient Buildings, The Education of the Public Taste. It would be instructive to receive once a year from the Presidents of our Provincial Architectural Associations a similarly comprehensive review of questions relating to the architectural and building interests this country. ____________________





IT is with pleasure that we call attention to the letter in another column of Mr. <person>John L. Phillips</person>, Secretary of the <assoc>Toronto

Builders' Exchange</assoc>, advocating the formation of a Provincial or National Association of Builders founded on lines similar to

National Association of the United States. Our correspondence enumerates some of the reasons which should serve to call into existence such an organization. There are many others who might be mentioned. Canadian builders are far behind in

matter of organization their brethren in the United States and Australian Colonies. They are also behind all other branches of

trade and industry of equal importance. Lastly they are behind, very much behind, the labor organizations, one of which, 

representing the <assoc>International Stonecutters' Union</assoc>, has been deliberating in Toronto during the past few days. Why should not the employers meet in like manner and discuss questions affecting their interests? The success which has attended the 

organization of the Toronto Builders' Exchange should prove an encouragement for the extension of the idea in accordance with our correspondent's suggestions, in order that questions of general

as well as local interest, including the important subject of legislation affecting the building trades, might receive proper consideration. We hope to see the subject thoroughly discussed and

early action taken. The ARCHITECT AND BUILDER will willingly place its columns at the disposal of those who may desire o express their views on the subject, and will otherwise assign in every way possible the carrying out of the idea
