to Hoffman's "Christ in the Temple ". Uhde's homely peasant groups tell their sacred story with a naivete that is touching. So with Skredswig, the Norwegian and Karl Bloch, the Kane. Delug preached the gospel of sympathy, of love and sorrow in his very impressive picture called " Holy Women ". Munkacsy's "Christ before Pilate ", though painted by a German, was painted in French atmosphere, and is more realistic than mystic in character. But '' The Raising of Jairus ' Daughter by Max truly leaves nothing to he desired in recent Sacred Art.

The characteristics of race are a factor that should find a place in this discussion. There is, however, only time to say that subjects in sacred art as treated by painters of the Latin race partake to a great degree of the romantic or traditional history of the Christian church, while the Teuton artists seem attracted more to the significant life and work of Christ himself. These race characteristics will likely prove an important factor because of the recent art movements, which have been more active in the zone dominated by the Teuton.

But space is too limited to allow further reference to comparative qualities amongst schools, and the painters who have told with sincerity arid dignity the story that is not yet half told. There is but time to refer to quantity. In doing this, even if we leave out of reckoning the wider view of its province and confine ourselves to the most limited classification laid down earlier in this paper, a review of the catalogues of the Royal Academy for the tell years past reveals at least seven sacred pictures each year, the Salons of France ten, Munich ten, Berlin ten, and so on.

Spain, Italy, Russia, Netherlands each brings its quota of recruits to the ranks of sacred art so that the annual muster numbers at the lowest computation one hundred and fifty.

If for the sake of a severer and more careful selection we place the number at one hundred, the decade has added one thousand



purely sacred pictures of highest merit to our gallery.

In conclusion let me add a fact that it will be well to note, that in the former era of Sacred Art, personal recompense by means of commissions given by a wealthy paternal institution helped greatly to inspire the artists then to paint religious subjects, while in these times such pictures are, without challenge, mainly the work of an unsuggested impulse.

If such be the fact, the claim that there is an influential Nineteenth Century Sacred Art appears to be well sustained and it may be that there is in this fact a prophecy that shall realize a bright fulfillment in the twentieth century so near at hand.
