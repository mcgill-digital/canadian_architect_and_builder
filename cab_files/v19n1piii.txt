<article title=" ENGINEERING JUDGMENT " author="">ENGINEERING JUDGMENT.

Captain Eads was once asked why he was so positive that the assertions of several eminent scientists concerning the condition of a river bed were erroneous, since these specialists were willing to stake their reputations on the truth of their claims. He answered that he could not understand the theories and did not have the time to hunt for their mistakes, but was sure about the river bed because he had examined a considerable part of it in a diving bell. Such, at least, is the story that is told of him, and it is worth mentioning here because it shows the great difference between science and judgment in matters of civil engineering.

<article title=" AIR MOISTENERS FOR FURNACES " author="">AIR MOISTENERS FOR FURNACES.

There has long been a demand for a practical apparatus for supplying moisture to artificially heated buildings, and there has at last been invented a practical vaporing apparatus to accomplish this purpose. It is arranged to be placed in the centre of the bonnet or top of the hot air furnace. The portion of the vaporizer below the main dome lies within the air chamber at the top of the furnace so that the series of small circular openings in the vaporizer may permit the vapor to moisten the air as it passes by it. The vaporizer consists of a small boiler automatically supplied with the water required, the water supply being controlled by means of a valve operated by a lever attached to a

piston connecting with a float in water chamber. When the water level has reached a given point, the float rises and closes the valve. When a sufficient quantity of water has passed through the hot air chamber, the float lowers, opens the valve and the water enters the vaporizer through the supply pipe. Hardware and Metal.
