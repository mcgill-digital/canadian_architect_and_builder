The owners of flats in Chicago were recently proceeded against by the medical health officer at the instance of their tenants for refusing to supply heat until the first of May as per the terms of their leases. The courts gave the landlords the option of either heating their buildings or spending a term in gaol. The present coal famine, while bringing home to the owners of flats a sense of their burden of responsibility has tended to popularize life in a flat because of the lessened responsibility which attaches to this mode of living.

Frank W. Hoyt, editor of '' Stone " in a letter recently addressed to the publishers of this journal says :

"There is one point on which I wish to commend your Journal, which is one of the most interesting that comes into my officeâ€” you give a good deal of attention to stone. It is my experience that architects as a rule know comparatively little about the nature of the different kinds of stone. The various publications that represent their profession give most of their attention to the consideration of structural material to iron and steel. Unless there is some change in the future, I fear that we will rear a generation of architects incapable of undertaking any great masonry structures such as have dignified architecture in the past."

When a man has built for himself a house to dwell in he ought to keep in mind not only his own ideas and requirements, but also the value which the building would he likely to have in the eyes of a probable purchaser. In this world of ups and downs the man who builds a house next year may find it necessary to sell it the year following or at some time in the future. This possibility should be kept in view from the outset. I could point you to a house built recently to meet the special requirements of the owner, but which is 110W on the market. It occupies a choice situation, but the value of the site as well as of the building has to a large extent been destroyed in the planning. Although expensively finished, the house does not contain more than two or three rooms of comfortable size, but is cut up into little boxes and narrow passages. If the owner should ultimately succeed in finding a buyer he will be obliged to sell at a heavy sacrifice.

I am informed on apparently reliable authority that there exists in Toronto a plumbers' combine. Halt a dozen of the leading firms are understood to be working together to secure the most important contracts at very profitable figures. I am told that when an important contract is to be let the members of these firms meet together and decide that it shall go to one or

other of their number with the understanding that the firm getting the job will stand aside in favor of another member of the combination when other large contracts are given. I have been given to understand that the combine have in some instances forced up prices of heating contracts from 50 to 100 per cent. Every effort is made to prevent arms outside the ring from getting contracts, by throwing discredit on the quality of their work. Are the architects aware of the existence of this combine and of the fact that because it exists their clients are obliged to pay fancy prices for their work ?
