BUILDING IN CHICAGO.

The Chicago Building Contractors Council, which recently cast off the yoke of the Building Trades Council, celebrated the victory by holding a banquet.

A dispatch from London states that a few weeks ago a small marble shaft fell from one of the windows in St. Andrew s Chapel, in Westminster Abbey, the iron pin that had sustained it for 600 years having become corroded. Iron pins are doing the same duty in innumerable places throughout  the Abbey and further dilapidation is apprehended. To overhaul and renew these pins would be a superhuman labor. Professor Church says that the use of gas as an illuminant in the Abbey, which is a limestone building, sets up a chemical change which is followed by disintegration. It has been suggested as a means of checking further decay that the Abbey be lighted by electricity, as is St Peters at Rome.

Combination Union Valve Elbow

Patented January 30, 1900





For Hot Water

Is more elegant in design than a Valve or an Elbow. It is quick opening (Qr. firm) and adjustable to either end of the radiator. It has a true curved, full sized

water way which reduces friction. It is neatly and compactly made of valve metal and packed ready to use. It has rough body, with finished trimmings and is nickel plated all over.

Operated with the foot. Costs no more than a



valve. Every one warranted.
