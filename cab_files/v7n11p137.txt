THE Royal Institute of British Architects proposes to expend the sum of £200 on a series of systematic tests of brickwork.





THE project for the erection in Toronto of a first-class hotel, is assuming more tangible shape. The names of responsible gentlemen—one a successful hotel proprietor—are given in connection with the undertaking. Preliminary plans for the building are said to have been prepared, and should financial obstacles not block the way, there appears to be every likelihood that the erection of the building will be proceeded with during the coming year. Toronto is emphatically behind the times in point of first-class hotel accommodation, and there is little doubt that if an hotel embracing every improvement is erected at a cost of a million dollars, as proposed, It will prove to be a paying investment.



BUFF bricks and terra cotta have been used in quite a number of the larger buildings erected within the last year or two, and now under way, in Toronto and Montreal. The appearance of these materials is pleasing in many but not in all instances. The red and brown shades for brick work will probably remain in greatest demand for all classes of work. The lighter colors have some advantages in certain positions, but never give the effect of strength and solidity that the darker shades do. Among their disadvantages may be mentioned their greater susceptibility to injury by smoke and dust. They can always be used with good results for trimmings and in combination with other shades, but their suitability in large masses depends largely on the surroundings of the proposed structure.



CONTRACTORS for masonry or brick-work should give as much attention as possible to the various uses of concrete and cement work, for which there is an increasing demand. These materials will undoubtedly continue to grow in favor, and the contractors who are best prepared to handle such work intelligently will most uniformly obtain good results, and reap a corresponding benefit. The proper use of cement requires far more care than ordinary mortar, and with it a contractor has more risk of loss through bad material or inexperienced workmen. In fact, the better kinds of concrete work should only be placed in the hands of the most skilled artisans. Concrete well finished in cement is the ideal cellar floor for dwellings, and its adoption for this purpose will be greatly increased as the importance of making houses moisture-proof becomes better understood. Laid in a similar manner, it is a favorite material for first-class sidewalks, and is unequalled for making a suitable road-bed for any kind of pavement. For foundations it is indispensable, while its value for fireproofing, and its adaptability to many other purposes in building are only beginning to be understood. In no kind of work should a contractor be more particular as to the quality of his materials. Whether using native or imported cement, he should be sure that it is in good condition, and not try to do work with any less than the quantity necessary for a thoroughly good job, but rather insure perfectly satisfactory results by allowing a margin on the side of strength. In our next issue we shall publish a number of carefully selected standard formulas for mixing concrete and cements.
