<article title=" BUILDING ON PERCENTAGE BASIS." author="">BUILDING ON PERCENTAGE BASIS.

The scheme of conducting building operations on a percentage basis continues to invite discussion in the trade, and supplementing what has already appeared on the subject in these columns, an architect whose practice is large volunteers the statement that for the past ten years all contracts awarded by him have been on a percentage basis, figured on the actual cost of all material and labor that entered into the work. The results of his experience have convinced him that his method is much more satisfactory than to let contracts for a given sum. He finds that while the owner has no contract in advance for the completion of the building at a fixed price, the expenditure is always within his control, and verification is possible whenever desired, says The Inland Architect. Itemized bills for material and labor are rendered from time to time, and he has the satisfaction of knowing the amount and kind of supplies that are being used in his building. The always annoying item of extras is eliminated, and changes required during the progress of the work are made with the least possible expense. The owner feels throughout that his interests and his alone are paramount. There is no temptation on the part of the contractor to use cheaper materials than are specified, nor to slight the work, as he is assured of a fair profit.

The contractor by the percentage plan is not liable for unexpected advances in prices, nor for penalties for delay. There are avoided all the uncertainties and risks that are ever present with a lump sum contract, and the contractor is free in mind to push the work at every point in furtherance of the quick completion of the building and the best interest of the owner. The contractor would not likely attempt to manipulate vouchers to show fictitious cost prices as, if he were so disposed, the knowledge of the architect would be a

certain check upon such practices. The architect mentioned encountered opposition at first from the owner, who has the natural desire to know his full obligation at the start, but this has been overcome in every case when the owner has had brought to his attention the probable saving in cost and the many substantial advantages to him from the percentage basis. The contractor by such an arrangement becomes, in a degree, the agent of the owner, and harmony between all parties to the construction is fostered. The usual position of the architect as a buffer between the owner and the contractor ceases.
