<doctype type="text">ability of Canadian architects to hold their own is in a measure admitted; indeed, in view of some recent examples of American work in Canada, the fact could not well be disputed. Finally, Canadian architects are not responsible for the fact that by the "Ontario Architects' Act" there has been created the absurd distinction of "architects" and "registered architects." The desire of the promoters of the Bill was that no person should be entitled to call himself an "architect" who had not given proof of his proficiency and registered under the Act. While on the legislative dissecting table where the measure was reduced to a mere skeleton of its original form, the word "registered" was inserted.



<article title="Toronto Architectural Sketch Club" author=""><assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.

THE second year of this Club was auspiciously opened by a well attended meeting held on Tuesday evening, the 9th September. As at this meeting notice of motion had to be given of any desired changes in the constitution, some discussion took place on the subject, resulting in a notice of motion being given to add to the number of officers by two, namely, a Vice-President and one more Director. A notice of motion was also given to give the Executive Committee power to appoint sub-committees. These changes will be voted on at the annual meeting to be held on Monday, October 6th, when officers for the coming year are to be elected.

Mr. <person>S. H. Townsend</person>, Registrar of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, spoke at some length on the Architects' Act, giving much interesting information to the architects and students who were present. After explaining fully the necessary forms with which they must comply, he dilated on the bright prospects which were now opening to the profession in Ontario, showing how the rising generation more especially would reap the benefits of the hard work of the promoters.

The President, Mr. <person>C. D. Lennox</person>, then closed the meeting by drawing attention to the competition for Club room decoration, asking for a large response, the Club being anxious to make their rooms present an appearance that would be creditable to so artistic a body.

LONGUEUIL CHURCH, P. Q.—<firm>PERRAULT & MESNARD</firm>,



ARCHITECTS, MONTREAL



The <building>Longueuil church </building>has been built on the site of the old church, which dated from 1812. The dimensions are as follows:

Total length, 200'; with vestry, 244'; width of nave at the entrance, 86'; width of sanctuary, 77'; width of transept, 135'; height of front, including statue, 116'; height of principal spire, 265'; height of dome, 150'. To dispense with too many columns, and thus obtain a clearer view of the sanctuary, the architects chose a Grecian cross in preference to a Roman, although the latter form would be more in accordance with Gothic traditions. By so doing they obtained a very picturesque effect. The general design is very simple, but on the whole presents an artistic appearance. The furniture, such as the altars, pulpit, vestry, &c., are very complete, and as every one knows, the appurtenances of a Roman Catholic church are very complicated. The total cost of the structure is about $130,000.

 MEETING of Montreal architects was held on Sept. 11th in the Board room of the <building>Mechanics' Hall </building>to receive the constitutions and by-laws framed by the Committee of Organization, and to consider the adoption of a few alterations suggested by the Quebec Association of Architects.

<article title="Correspondence - Montreal" author="">MONTREAL.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



BUILDING operations in Montreal have become quite brisk owing to widening of the various streets, building material expropriated by the city on the south side of Notre Dame street has been sold by public auction and is now almost entirely removed from McGill street to Chaboillez Square, and builders are now actively engaged in the construction of new buildings to replace the old ones. Among others a large hotel adjoining the <building>Balmoral hotel Montreal</building>is under contract for the Smith estate. This will be a handsome limestone building, five stories high, practically fire proof and with all modern conveniences in plumbing, and accommodation for about seventy-five guests adjoining this building estate Biron are erecting three large stores, <person>Judge Barrie </person>two stores and dwellings the estate Rodier is also preparing to erect a large building in their property, while <person>alderman Shorey</person>, <person>Mr. Miller </person>and <person>Mr. Wilson </person>have bought in the old fronts and are rebuilding them on the old line.

<building>MONTREAL COURT HOUSE</building>.

The contract for the addition for the Montreal Court House has, I hear, been awarded to Messrs. <firm>Berger & Chartrand</firm>. The several tenders are reported to have been thrown out by the Government for not complying with the conditions. What the conditions were seems difficult to understand, as several contractors who have large experience in public works have had their tenders thrown out for irregularities, It is rumored that the Government required each tendered to give a detail price list of all the work the tender included, which most of the builders omitted doing, simply stating in the usual way a lump sum as per plans and specifications.

APPLIED SCIENCE—<building>MCGILL UNIVERSITY</building>.

I hear McGill University has secured the services of two additional professors for the science department under the Macdonald endowment; one to be professor of mechanical engineering and the other professor of experimental physics. It is said that they are graduates of Cambridge and men well qualified for their respective positions, It is to be hoped that such is the case as practical professors of engineering, bath mechanical and civil, are badly needed in this country, and now that a special technical building with all the necessary appliances is to be attached to McGill University, the students will expect to get more than theoretical instruction.

PERSONAL

<person>Mr. Steele</person>, of the firm of <firm>Hutchinson & Steele</firm>. architects. is giving up practice and intends to reside in England. Ill health is the cause. Mr. Steele was considered one of the best designers in the city and will no doubt be missed.

<article title="Civic Improvements" author="">.



Montreal is this year spending a vast amount of money. whether judiciously or not, remains to be seen. One can hardly pass a street that is not being torn up either for water, sewers or paving. Considerable wrangling has been going on of late regarding the construction of civic work by contract or day's work, and no satisfactory solution seems yet to have been arrived at. Where work has been done by "day's work " property owners complain that they have been assessed more heavily than when similar work has been done under contract.

FLOOD PROTECTION.

Little or nothing has been done in regard to this all important question. The plan submitted by the French engineer to the Government has been by them submitted to the harbor commissioners. His idea is to rectify the course of the St. Lawrence by running a line of wall or embankment across from the main land to Nuns Island and reclaiming all the land inside of that Island and above It to the fourth pier of Victoria bridge. The wall or shore line would commence on the lower end of Nuns Island, run to the fourth pier of Victoria bridge and from that with an inward curve to the point below the Canada Pacific elevators. Below the mouth of the canal the embankment would be a narrowing sphere of land coming to a point at the lower end opposite Brock street thus reclaiming a large space from the river for harbor and docks and enclosing the still water basin. The long wharf would be cut away, half of Isle Rond would disappear, the channel between St. Helen's Island and St. Lambert would be deepened, leaving Moffat's Island in the midst of two deep channels. Between this Island and St. Lambert it is proposed to construct the bridge with sluices to permit the water and ice to pass in winter and to be closed in summer to send as much water to the main channel on the Montreal side as possible. He claims (like all other plans for the doing away of floods) the erection of a still water harbor and graving docks the cost is not given but would be great—too great at least to be considered when compared with the advantages to be gained.
