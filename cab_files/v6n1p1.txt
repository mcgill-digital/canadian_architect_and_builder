All are architects of    Fate,

Working	in these

walls of Time;

Some with

massive deeds

and great,

Some ornaments of rhyme.

In the elder days of Art, Builders wrought with care.

Let us do our work as

well,

Make the

house, where Gods may dwell. Beautiful, entire, and clean. 

Build to-day 

then, strong and

sure,

With a firm and ample base;

And ascending and secure

Shall to-morrow find its place.
