COOLING ROOMS IN SUMMER.

AN apparatus has been devised by Professor Elmer Gates of Washington for the ready cooling of' rooms in summer, which he declares to be capable of being more cheaply operated in summer than a coal stove in winter. It is simply a tall cylinder of galvanized iron resting in a large basin or pan, and connecting at the top with the ordinary stovepipe, or with a tube leading out of the window. In the top of the cylinder's interior is a perforated tubular ring, and when a cock is turned on this ring an artificial shower is caused inside the cylinder. The water thus flowing down the sides takes a rapid spiral motion, which sucks the air down the cylinder at a rapid rate, a fine spray inside cooling the air thus entering, reducing its humidity to normal and

taking out all dust and bad odors; the water collects in the basin below, from which it is drained off, the cool air escaping through openings just above the water surface of the basin. In some experiments exhibited with this contrivance, the temperature of the air on entering the cooling cylinder was observed to be about ninety-two degrees, while it was as low as sixty-eight on its coming out at the bottom. When the temperature of the laboratory is ninety-two degrees, the atmosphere inside can thus be cooled to about seventy within three hours, and the humidity at the same time may go down to from one hundred to about normal.



Mr. John H. Russell, architect, of Winnipeg, Man., was married on the 2nd inst., in Toronto, to Miss Aggie Campbell, daughter of Mr. Thos. Campbell, of that city.
