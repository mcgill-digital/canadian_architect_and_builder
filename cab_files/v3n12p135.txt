imated the sum announced. If the jury had not been practical men, the probability is that "popular suffrage" would have selected the most showy design regardless of cost.

It is to be hoped that the establishment of Quebec's new Association of Architects will engender such an esprit du corps that corporations in the future will be compelled to formulate proper conditions of competition or be minus designs from competent and self-respecting architects in that province.

A

 MEETING of the Council was held in the rooms of the Toronto Architectural Sketch Club on Wednesday and Thursday, December 3rd and 4th. Present: Messrs. <person>Arnoldi</person> and <person>Ewart, </person>of Ottawa; <person>Rastrick </person>and <person>Edwards</person>, of Hamilton; <person>Blackwell</person>, of Peterboro', and <person>D. B. Dick,</person> <person>Curry</person> and <person>Burke</person>, Toronto, and the Registrar, Mr. <person>S. H. Townsend</person>. The President, <person>Mr. Storm</person>, was unavoidably absent, much to his regret, through pressure of business engagements. In his absence the Vice-President, Mr. Arnoldi, took the chair.

A large amount of important business was transacted. The Toronto members who had been appointed at the August meeting to act as a Committee on By-laws, presented a draft report.

Messrs. Arnoldi and Ewart, the Committee on Education, presented a draft report of a comprehensive course of subjects to be required of students in the various examinations.

The Registrar reported that he had received 140 applications for registration, embracing almost every known peison in practice in the province. After a scrutiny of the names the list was approved.

The draft by-laws of the Association were adopted after the insertion of several amendments and additions, and will be submitted to the Association for ratification or revision at the Convention to be held in February next.

The draft by-laws governing the Council of the Association were then carefully considered, and after various additions and amendments, adopted. These by-laws defined the duties of the various officers and the examiners.

The annual fee was fixed at $15 for resident members, (that

is, resident in the County of York, and City of Toronto), and $10

for non-resident members, payable on or before the 1st of July

of each year. If not paid until after this date, the fee to be $20

and $15 respectively. Student fees—Upon admission as a

student, $5 filing indentures, $1 ; each examination, $1.

It was also resolved that no member of the Association shall retain in his office any student unless he is properly registered and in good standing in the books of the Registrar.

The Registrar reported that many students had not yet registered, and stated that the probable reason was through a misunderstanding as to the date up to which applications would be received, owing to the lapse of time between the passing of the Act and the appointment of the Council. It was therefore, on motion, resolved, that students be allowed to register up to the date of the first annual convention in February; and that notice be sent to all registered architects requesting them to draw the attention of their students to such extension of time.

Mr. Curry presented a proposition made by representatives of the Presbyterian Church with regard to the issue of a publication having in view the improvement of the design of Presbyterian church edifices. It was resolved "That having heard with much pleasure this proposition, a competition, or series of competitions, be instituted under the auspices of this Association, the Council hereby approving of the object desired to be attained, and that we consent to appoint a judge or judges for these competitions."

The arrangements for the forthcoming Convention were then discussed. It was decided to omit the holding of an exhibition of drawings, with the hope that a thoroughly representative one may be held in 1892.

Messrs. Storm, Dick and Curry were appointed a Cornmittee on Programme and Arrangements for the Convention.

Messrs. Arnoldi, Burke, Blackwell and Edwards were appointed a Committee on papers to be presented, Mr. Arnoldi being Chairman, with instructions to report to the Registrar not later than Jan. 15th.

Mr. Curry read a communication from the Secretary of the

Quebec Association regarding the proposed competition for the Board of Trade offices in that city.

The following letter to the Secretary of the Montreal Board of Trade was drafted and ordered to be sent forthwith

<person>GEORGE HADRILL</person>, ESQ. Secretary Board of Trade, Montreal.

<article title="Correspondence – Montreal Board of Trade Building" author="Townsend, S.H.">DEAR SIR—The Council of the Ontario Association of Architects has had under consideration the conditions of competition for the proposed <building>Board of Trade Building n Montreal</building>, and has decided to recommend all members of the Association to refrain from competing for the following reasons.

1st. That the board has selected six architects resident in the United States and agreed to pay them $300 each to send in competitive designs and has not seen fit to select six Canadian architects in like manner, but has decided to award $30c each to the authors of the six Canadian designs placed highest in order of merit by the expert. Under such an invidious distinction the most capable Architects will not compete as the competition really resolves itself into a contest for the paltry sum of $300 and the slight possibility of obtaining the commission to erect the building. If your board had selected six Canadian architects of the highest standing, the competition would have been one between six representative architects resident in the United States, and six resident in Canada, and would have been likely to meet with a hearty response from Canadians, but under the conditions advertised the most capable architects in Canada will not compete, and the competition will really be between six firms of architects in the United States—some of them of the highest standing-and such men in Canada as are prepared to compete for the $300, knowing that the best men in the profession in Canada are not competing.

2nd. That the amount appropriated is utterly inadequate for the erection of the building, and that any design which could be carried out for any sum near the amount named would be absolutely certain of rejection.

Very truly yours.

S.H. TOWNSEND, Registrar.

The report of the Committee on Education was taken up clause by clause, and finally adopted as follows: Preliminary Examinations.—Candidates for admission as pupils or students in the office of a registered architect, must have passed the examination of the second form of a High School or Collegiate Institute; or, as an alternative, the entrance examination to a High School or Collegiate Institute, and an examination in mathematics and either French or German equivalent to the second form as above.

The members of the Council resident in Toronto were appointed a Committee to compile a list of text books required for preparation for the above examinations, and to define and add to the list of subjects as may be thought advisable.

It was decided that students may go up for the two intermediate examinations to such localities as may be designated by the Council from time to time, as may be required.
