<article title="Electricity for Lighting Dwellings" author="">ELECTRICITY FOR LIGHTING DWELLINGS

I

 N a recent address before the <assoc>Society of Arts, London</assoc>, Mr.

<person>W. H. Preece</person>, a well-known expert, speaking of the matter of expense, referring to the glow-lamp of Edison said that the commercial out put has been increased six times, white its cost has been diminished eight times." He further shows how the machinery, such as the steam engine for this purpose, has been greatly improved, lie claims that in the general post-office, London, the light from the electric glow-lamp cost twenty-two shillings as against the gas-lamp at eighteen shillings per annum In referring to its hygienic value from a purely mercenary stand point, he says "In our Central Saving Bank in London it has been found, after two year s experience of electric lighting, that the average amount of absences from illness has been diminished by about two days a year for each person on the staff. This is equivalent to a gain to the service of the time of about eight clerks in that department alone. Taking the cost at the 'overtime' rate only, this would mean a saving in salaries of about £640 a year. The cost of the installation of the electric light was £3.349, and the annual cost of working £700 per annum

—say a total annual cost of £1,034. The cost of the gas consumed for lighting pur-poses, was about £700 year, so that on a whole there was a direct saving of something like £266 a year to the government, besides the material advantage of the better work of the staff resulting from the improved atmospheric conditions under which their work is done."

<article title="Montreal Ice Palace" author="">MONTREAL ICE PALACE. <building>MONTREAL ICE PALACE</building>

M

ONTREAL is to have another winter carnival next month, and

(weather permitting) an ice palace as the principal attraction. The designs for the palace have been prepared by Messrs. <person>E. C. Hopkins </person>and <person>J. A. Radford</person>, architects, of that city. A correspondent reminds us that <person>Catharine of Russia </person>was the first to show to the world the possibility of erecting such a structure, and quotes in this connection the following lines of Cowper

No forest fell, imperial mistress of the fur-clad Russ !

When thou would'st build; no quarry sent its stores

T'enrich thy walls; but thou didst hew the flood, And make thy marble of the glassy wave,"

For more than a century and a half no attempt was made to rival the structure of the Russian queen. A few years ago, however, at the suggestion of Mr. <person>R. D. McGibbon</person>, of Montreal, the idea of a winter carnival and ice palace was successfully carried out, and has been as successfully repeated on several occasions since.
