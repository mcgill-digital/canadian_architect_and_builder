		It stands the test of time. Greatest popularity,

		Greatest sales. In use everywhere.

		THE "ECLIPSE"

		Door Spring and Check,

		For simplicity, utility and cheapness, holds the mar-

		fret against all imitations.

The "ECLIPSE" effectually prevents the annoyance and danger

occasioned by thoughtless people, who either leave the door wide open, causing a draft, or jar your nervous system by slamming the door with a bang. The

Eclipse Spring shuts the door every time, the Eclipse Check stops the slamming.



Recommended by Architects. Extensively used by Builders.
