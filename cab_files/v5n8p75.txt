NOTICE OF REMOVAL.



On or about the 20th of September, the publication offices of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER will be removed to the new <building>Confederation Life Association Building</building>, corner of Yonge and Richmond Streets, Toronto.



IN connection with the publication of the competition design for a suburban house in our last issue, we omitted to print the name of the author, Mr. <person>W. Ford Howland</person>, Toronto.



THE project for Connecting Prince Edward Island with the mainland by a sub-marine tunnel is assuming practical shape. At the last session of Parliament, $12,000 was appropriated to cover the cost of making preliminary surveys. Borings for the approaches on the island have already been made, and the character of the rock is reported to be favorable for tunnelling.



PUBLIC recognition of architectural ability is of rare occurrence. An instance of Such recognition, however, is at present seen in the determination of the trustees to place in the <building>library of Cornell University </building>a portrait in oil of the architect of the building, Mr. <person>W. H. Miller</person>. The painting of the portrait has been entrusted to a Canadian artist, Mr. <person>J. C. Forbes</person>.



THE members of the <assoc>Chicago Architectural Sketch Club </assoc>have been invited to submit designs in a competition for a permanent memorial monument to the late <person>J. W. Root</person>. The memorial is to cost $I5,000, and is proposed to be erected in Jackson Park. In view of Mr. Root's ability as an architect, and his popularity, especially with the younger members of the profession, this com petition should awaken much enthusiasm, and call forth the best efforts of which the members of the Club are capable.



A SYNDICATE, in which some Toronto persons are interested, has been formed to manufacture steel by what is known as the Hastings process. The surprising claim is made that by means of this process structural and cast steel adaptable for all purposes can be manufactured from pig iron at a cost of a few cents per ton. Such a discovery might be expected to give an impetus to iron production in Canada and greatly cheapen the cost of the construction of large buildings in which iron and steel are so largely employed.



REFERRING to the death of the late <person>W. T. Thomas</person>, of Montreal, the American Architect states that he was "still in the prime of his usefulness, being only sixty-four years old at the time of his death," and adds, "but our harrassing and poorly-paid profession does not favor longevity in those who practice it, and we can perhaps hardly say that he was too soon released from his anxieties." Without disputing the fact that the practice of architecture is usually attended with many vexations and much mental anxiety, it nevertheless appears to us anomalous that our contemporary should have selected as an example of the effect of these influences one who had almost attained to the allotted three score years and ten. It should be borne in mind that the men who live beyond sixty years, are largely in the minority.



THE Toronto City Council has foolishly allowed the opportunity to pass of securing, at a moderate cost, the enlargement of the space for traffic at the corner of King and Yonge streets. The owner of the old building on the north-east corner has recently replaced it by a new structure, which, although not of an
