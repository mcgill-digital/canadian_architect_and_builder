T

HE old-fashioned city of over 25 years ago has put off many of its characteristic traits and donned quite a new and comparatively modern physiognomy.

These city gates have either disappeared in

total, as with the three facing on the St. Charles

and the St. Lawrence, where, on account of the precipitousness of the cliff, the unnecessary walls have been lowered to allow of being seen over thus giving to tourists on entering the city from the C. P. R. a splendid view of the port— one of the finest and most extensive in the world—or have been remodelled, rebuilt in a way to be less offensive to the outlying wards, which had come to view the barriers as lines of social distinction between themselves and the would-be aristos  within.

The stratagetic curves of the old approaches to the city walls having lost their prestige under the high and far flying missiles of war of modern times, the sinuosities outside of the city gates are now replaced by straight and unbroken lines of streets, while the crenelated tops of the new gates are there to remind us of our ancient military glory.

The Grande Allee," extending a mile beyond the city proper, has had its width not less than doubled, and along its southern side we have the splendid new " Drill Hall,' built after the designs of <firm>M. M. Tache & Fuller</firm>, architects, but laid at a level fully five feet lower than it should have been to be properly seen from the St. Louis road.

Nearly opposite the I)rill Hall is the Short and Wallick monument. designed and executed by our talented Canadian artist, <person>Hebert</person>, who also carved the " Indian (;rouI) over the fountain opposite the tower of the Parliament buildings, but which is singularly marred in its effect by being set at a level about three feet lower than it should be. The new Government architect, <person>Mr. Charest</person>, should see to this, and that there be erected without further delay, and as much more pressing than the enclosure walls around the grounds, a porchway such that a carriage may drive under and persons be thus enabled to enter the building tinder cover, instead of, as in the case of the last ball, having to hold an umbrella over every gentleman's and lady's head as they successively entered the buildings with garments thoroughly drenched by the storm.

The portico alluded to could be most easily and aesthetically erected opposite the main or central tower by making each of the two angle piers of the porch a group of four columns like those on the opposite side, bringing forward the present entablature and completing the sides.

The most ungainly facade along the river side of the Grande Allee is that of the skating rink which architect Staveley had made quite a fine feature of when on the opposite side of the street, but which from motives of economy, he was prevented from having carried out on its previous lines when moved to its present site to clear the ground fronting on the new <building>Parliament Buildings</building>. Ranges of fine dwelling houses have sprung up all along the thoroughfare, and of various design, under architects <person>Raymond</person>, <person>Berlinguet</person>, <person>Peachy</person>, <person>Tanguay, </person><person>Bussieres</person>, <person>Bernier</person>, <person>Talbot</person> and others, with, further on, Stout and Layer's Female (01(1 military) <building>Orphan Asylum</building>, <building>Le Court's Protestant Home</building>, with the <building>St. Bridget's Asylum</building> and many fine residences on the opposite side, including the so-called Langelier block by Berlmuguet, but where the site is far too straitened for the size of edifice—-too many trumpery finials about its roof, and too much crowding of the hays and oriels on the central corps and portico. <person>Dr. Verge's</person> dwelling is amongst others worthy of remark.

The principal architectural feature along this thoroughfare is, of coarse, the Parliament Buildings already incidentally alluded to, the architects of which were <person>M. M. Gauvreau</person>, <person>Tache</person>, <person>Derome</person>, <person>Cousin</person>, <person>Ganvin</person> and <person>Lesage</person> ; but that an article like the present, published in such a journal, may have its full utility, as a lesson to all concerned and to architects and the public in

general to prevent the repetition of such a costly blunder, it will be seen that the building all around the 300 feet quadrangle should have been 60 feet in depth instead of 50 feet, making rooms instead of guts of the spaces on either side the central corridor, and adding 33 pet cent. to the available depth for stairs instead of the break-neck things they are.

The building, of which the exterior is well enough proportional and the architectural features not unaesthetic, though no building can be truly grand which, like this, has not a central feature—a dome for instance, a spire or a tower rising from a structure in its midst, and around which the outer portions of the edifice may cluster and rise the one above the other (" pyramider ") an expression which can hardly be rendered in the sister language except by the word 'to tower,' but which is exemplified in our <building>new Frontenac Hotel</building>, by <person>Bruce Price</person>, of New-York, architect, with the exception that the roof over the entrance gate should have been made just one storey higher, and thus have hidden at the same time the upper rear corner of the main building not intended to be seen, and which protrudes itself most ungraciously into sight.

Now it will hardly he credited that while the splendid cut stone enclosure wall and lofty ornamental wrought and cast iron railing around the Marine Hospital, Quebec, designed by the writer, costs but $13.00 per foot lineal complete in situ, the mere coping alone of the more than 6,000 feet lineal of walls surrounding the Parliament grounds, with its underlying plinth course and dwarf foundation to the rock, and exclusive of cement, has been paid for at the enormous rate of $29.50 per foot lineal, exclusive of iron work, thus swelling its cost to tour times the price of the wall alluded to, and amounting to the astounding sum of $200,000 or more.

The workmanship, it is necessary to say, is very fine, and the 12-foot granite monoliths superb but I do not know at whose door the fault is to he laid of giving the separating pillars a projection on all sides of only 1 1/2 in.. which should have been at least from 3 to 4 1/2 inches to render the work architecturally effective, making it deeply to be regretted that so much of the public money has been expended on a work which in proper hands could have been rendered an acceptable feature of the general design at much less than half the cost.

Persons who have not visited the city within the last fifteen years must be reminded that we have a terrace which is well worth seeing, and of which <person>Princess Louise </person>and the <person>Marquis of Lorne</person>, while performing the ceremony of throwing it open to the public in 1879, said to Mr. Baillairge, engineer of the structure, while cordially congratulating him and shaking him by the hand, " this is the fittest promenade in the world," and  I believe it may be considered, not only on account of its length, though less than that if St. Germain in France, but hanging as it docs, so to say, from the face of the cliff at the sensational height of 182 feet above mean tide level of the St. Lawrence.

This terrace, erected by the city entirely of wood at the time, and at a cost of only $20,000, from motives of economy, has since been walled led in on the river side at the expense of the Federal Government at a cost of over $60,000, said wall forming portions of the enceinte fortification of the city, and which had been destroyed by the landslide of 1841 and what it will now behove us soon to (10, is to replace the perishable structure by stone and iron, brick and asphalt cross walls at distances of sixty feet apart being necessary not only fur floor supporting purposes, but to counteract the ever-present, ever-active tendency of all such side-hill structures to move forward and downward by the effect of earth and frost pressure from the rear. The space from wall to wall would be spanned by sixty ft. built plate girders with intervening supporting columns iron joists laid across these at say three ft. centres, brick archings between them, and concrete and asphalt over all, estimated to cost another $60,000.

The new Post Office, but which can hardly be called so now, should evidently have had a proper architectural facade towards the St. Lawrence, and had its upper floor windows been made of proper height, the extra course or two of masonry taken
