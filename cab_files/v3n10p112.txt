the occupants of half a dozen houses, and his children must romp in the public streets.

It may be a surprise to some, but it is a fact that nearly one half the cubic contents of an ordinary house may be classed as unavailable, that is, taken up by cellerage, halls, stairs and roof space. The proportion of unavailable space in an apartment house is not more than one-fifth as much.

With a well laid out apartment house, a greater proportion of sunlit living rooms may be obtained, while a well-lit court beautified with flowers and a fountain would replace the narrow and ill-kept backyards.

Labor saving appliances in the apartment house may be multiplied at small cost. The host of furnaces with their dust, dirt, ashes and care, are dispensed with, a central heating plant being substituted, while every apartment may have its own automatic heat regulator. Lifts, electric lights, and speaking tubes would take the place of the wearisome and cumbrous methods of life at present in vogue.

The buildings could be made far more attractive architecturally, both inside and out, while the sanitary appliances could be of a description far superior to those which obtain in an ordinary house. Isolation could be better secured—thick walls and soundproof floors taking the place of flimsy dividing walls through which an ordinary conversation may be heard.

The worry and labor of house-keeping would be much reduced. In certain cases the kitchen could be omitted and co-operative cooking and washing adopted, still further reducing the labor and responsibility of the housekeeper.

Available space equal to that in the ordinary house, plus the advantages above remunerated, could be obtained with no more, and probably less cost.

The advantage of families being able to obtain just the number of rooms required is another point in favor of the apartment house. Quite a percentage of small families of moderate income are compelled for the sake of respectability and decency to lease houses larger than their needs or resources warrant, and to eke out the rent have to let furnished rooms or take in boarders. To these the apartment house would be a great boon.
