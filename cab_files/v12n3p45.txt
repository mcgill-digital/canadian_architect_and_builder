THIS Spring Number of the CANADIAN

This Number.	ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is intended as



a substitute for the Special Number which until this year it was our custom to publish at New Years.

In Toronto, however, the temperature is as a rule much higher than in most localities.

The cost of building is likely to be enhanced at least to the extent of recent advances in price of materials. It is to be hoped that contractors' figures may likewise be increased to a point which will allow of a reasonable margin of profit. The season of 1898 was satisfactory so far as the volume of work done was concerned, but on all sides the com
