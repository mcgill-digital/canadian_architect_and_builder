Do You Know the Merits of





CEMENT SIDING ON "HERRINGBONE" LATH?

IT allows a greater variety of finish at a lower cost than

any ofher construction. It gets stronger with age. It

is vermin proof, weather proof and fire proof.

It solves the housing problem in over-crowded towns

and cities, because it is quickly erected, and is cheaper

than wood.
