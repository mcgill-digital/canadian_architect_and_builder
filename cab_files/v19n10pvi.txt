<article title=" ORIGIN OF THE WORD "MEWS " author="">ORIGIN OF THE WORD "MEWS."

With regard to the word "mews" which I have used in regard to the baron's stable, I have sometimes been asked by people as to the origin of this term as applied to stables. It dates hack to the olden times when the King of England and the great nobles kept falcons for purpose of the chase. The large and roomy buildings where these costly and highly prized birds were kept used to be described as "the mews, owing to the fact that the birds mewed, or moulted there annually. King Charles 11, although he appointed his illegitimate son by <person>Nell Gwynne</person>, namely, the Duke of St. Albans, to the office of hereditary high falconer, a sinecure which is held to-day by his descendant, the pre

sent Duke of St. Albans, nevertheless did away with the royal falcons and converted the building where they were kept into stables for his horses. The building had been known up to that time as the the Royal Mews, and it has retained that name ever since, the term being, in course of time, applied to stables of any kind. --Marquise de Fontenoy, in New York Tribune.

They propose to establish a plant in Montreal, which will have an initial capacity of 600,000 barrels per year. The plans, howâ€” ever call for the laying out of a plant which will have an eventual capacity of 1,200,000 barrels per annum.
