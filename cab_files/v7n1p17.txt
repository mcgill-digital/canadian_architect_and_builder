from the space above would have corrected the top heaviness of the structure.

The new Court House is of course a great improvement in size and style as compared with the old building, but the combined areas of openings is considerably beyond what it should be in relation to that of walls. The architects of these two buildings were, of course, some one or more of the Government quintet already named.

I have alluded incidentally to the new hotel, and would state that the architect, Mr. <person>Bruce Price</person>, of the United States, has, in my opinion, been guilty of a serious omission In not providing in any way for escape in case of flue, nor for a few outside iron balconies where one could sit and smoke and have a cup of coffee while enjoying the view and music. In other respects the building is a fine structure, and its architecture, its plan, its site, well suited to tile fortress-like surroundings.

We have designs at hand for a new City Hall on the Jesuits' lot, and this is the lot it should he built on as, though it may not appear to he quite centrally situated, since St. Sauveur has been annexed, there is no doubt that any extension of the city will now occur towards Hedlyville, and make it in reality the central site required.

St. John suburbs, under architect Peachy, has erected a spacious and costly (say $200, 000) new cathedral instead of that destroyed by tire in 1881, but the diameter if its spire is by several feet less than it should have been.

In the lower town Hon. <person>P. Garneau </person>has erected, under Contractor Parent, a splendid new $100, 000 stone structure, but my friend <person>Tangnay</person>, the architect, has been guilty of a freak, which cannot be called a license, and would not be tolerated anywhere - that of running his mullion or dividing column tight up to the very keystone of the upper or attic window instead of cutting it short at tile impost level and throwing the space above into two sub arches and a central panel or spandrel.

St. Roch's has now become, so to say, the commercial portion of the city, and the merchants and citizens of that locality have erected some very fine buildings under <person>Mr. Raymond</person> at the corner of Crown and St. Joseph streets, others by architects <person>Talbot</person>, <person>Bussieres</person>, <person>Bernier</person>, <person>Vallee</person> and <person>Dussault</person> one of the finest by <person>Peachy</person>, for Labibertee, the furrier. The stateliest of all, some six tall stories in height, and of solid monolithic granite piers, and polished granite columns for <person>Paquet</person>, under his architects and builders. <person>M. M. Charest </person>and <person>Bertrand</person>.

New streets have been opened in the lower town, as Dalhousie and St. Andre, facing on the St. Lawrence and haihor works of the River St. Charles. Others have been widened some prolonged, as St. Paul street to St. Andre, St. John St. Within, Fabrique. And in the upper town have been widened, St. Claire and Salaberry in St. John Ward.

D'Youville street, by Kent Gate, eases off the grade from St. Lewis to St. John's wards, and Negresse Hill, that from John to Jacques Cartier wards, while a new grade is being run from Grande Allee to the Citadel Heights at the old French fortifications, where a splendid view of the harbor can he had, and of a dozen parishes around and the main road reached again by a loop line without leaving one's carriage.

It is only lately we have enacted that henceforth all streets be at least 66 ft. in width, and lots 100 ft. deep, after my showing on the occasion of each of our monster fires of 1845, ]866 and 1881, etc., that their extent was due to nothing but want of depth in our heretofore 60 ft. lots, where if you build a house 30 ft. in depth, stables or an outhouse another 20 ft., there remains but to ft. between the two, with 30 feet streets between the blocks.

We now have in addition to the St. Louis and Frontenac hotels, the Royal Albion ; and the Florence House tinder <person>B. Trudelle</person>, is also one of the most central and best patronized hotels in the city, with lines of busses to drive you any and everywhere ; and the city having just opened a new line of communication by Mount Pleasant into St. Ours street, I would advise tourists wishing to enjoy a splendid view of the valley of the St. Charles to go out by Grande Allee, down Salaberry, get out at the steep part of the new hill, enjoying the view as you go down, resume your carriage at Arago street level, and then do St. Sauveur and St. Rochs, returning to the Frontenac or Florence by Abraham Hill and St. John street within or without.

The old wooden stairways between the upper and lower wards of the city have been replaced by elegant and costly new structures of cast and wrought iron, as at St. Claire and St. Augustin streets, and more recently at Boade and Champlain streets, with others to follow, as from the St. Charles hattery to St. James street, and maybe from the remote extremity of Dufferin Terrace to Champlain street, while a new hill is contemplated from tile Cove field to Cap. Blanc, thus saving a two miles' circuit to reach it by the brigade in case of fire.

Other alterations have obtained by which we have rechristened many of our streets, which bore duplicate, triplicate, and even quadruplicate names. We had, for instance, not less than four St. Peter's," four St. Francis'," three St. Joseph's," etc., which were fruitful of many errors and inconveniences. They ate now called by names dear to memories gone by I)e <person>Breboeuf Garneau</person>, <person>Ferland</person>, <person>Christie</person>, <person>McMahon</person>, <person>O'Connell</person>, <person>Colbert</person>, <person>Chenier</person>, et al, while a host of St. Sauveur saints have kindly stepped aside and been replaced by names less suggestive of prayers, pilgrims and poverty, and more of battles, bacon

and business, as <person>Kirouc</person>, <person>Fi set</person>, <person>Durocher</person>, <person>Racine</person>, <person>Charest</person>, <person>Charlevoix</person>, <person>Elgin</person>, <person>d'Youville</person>, <person>Hebert</person>, <person>Lalemant</person>, <person>Lansdowne</person>, <person>Coulomb</person>, <person>Cartier</person>, <person>Montcalm</person>, <person>Wolfe</person> amid others.

Quebec is admittedly the best electro-lit city in America. It has a fine water power both for fire and domestic purposes under a head of 486 ft. from Lorette to mean tide level of the St. Lawrence. We have just completed under architect Peachy a splendid new fire station in Dorchester street ; another new one in St. Sauveur by architect Cousin, is also under way, while still another is having its foundation laid in Lower Town near the Custom House—nine in all—and while danger from fire is thereby combated on the one hand, all anxiety as to proper sanitation is freely provided against by our new quarantine system at Ile Palais, our costly steam disinfecting apparatus and our splendid new <building>Hotel Dieu Hospital</building> just erected under architect <person>Tanguay</person>, at a cost of a third of a million of dollars in Palace ward.

There is, however, one important thing we can not as yet boast of, and that is of the improved character of many' of our streets. A million of dollars would be necessary to pave our hills and business thoroughfares with solid granite, and we can not afford such an outlay ; though I call it false economy.

Our places of worship for all denominations are numerous and spacious, St. Matthew's having recently been rebuilt by Staveley, and the <building>Seminary Chapel </building>by Peachy, but of which the inner galleries must be lowered in front or tile interior made a failure.

Our educational status is high, with Laval in our midst ; our poor well eared for by the Grey Nuns (Sisters of Charity-) ; our too loving ones by the Asylum of the Good Shepherd ; the waifs at the Sacre Coeur ; and close at hand is the <building>Beauport Asylum</building> for all our mentally afflicted.

In addition to the <firm>Grand Trunk and Intercolonial railways</firm>, we now have communication with the remainder of the world around us by the Quebec Central, the C.P.R., the Q. & L. S.

J.	Railway, and the Quebec, Montmorency and Charlevoix and the six companies should agree during our proposed carnival of February next to bring the people of our sister cities here to see the progress we have made. The <building>new Frontenac Hotel</building>, costing nearly a million of dollars, and of which the dining-room tapestry alone is valued at over $3,000, will be opened for the occasion, and a splendid reception tendered nor guests in the new palace, and what between sleighing, coasting, snow-shoeing, curling, skating and other fun, a drive to the source of electric light supply at Montmorency Falls and mammoth ice cones (If the Montmorency, a view of our ice palaces and statues and of the proposed 150 ft. pyramid (If beauty over the illuminated fountain at the Place d'Armes, together with other attractions, such as ice-boating on the St. Lawrence and St. Charles, a good time may be anticipated by all our visitors, whom our mayor, <person>Mr. Fremont, M. P</person>., <person>Senator Hearn </person>and other city aldermen and councilors, anti in a word all our citizens, will right royally welcome and endeavor to amuse and make happy' to the fullest extent of their power. The new <building>Palace Hotel </building>of itself is well worth the trouble and expense of coming to see, and old Strathacona, even without the additional fun and attractions of a winter carnival, in which Montreal is to join us with several thousand of its snow-shoers, skaters, curlers and the crowds of other athletes who have promised to add to the festivities of the occasion.

And should the St. Lawrence be frozen over for the occasion, and our trees be decked as they generally are at such a season in snow crystals reflecting the component colors of the sunbeam and electric light, the millions of ruby-, emerald, sapphire, topaz and diamond hues will enhance the fairy-like nature of the scene.

Our attention has recently been called to errors in the above book, In the wages table on page 7t, $14.96 is given as the wages for 66 1/2 hours work at 21 cents per hour; the amount should he $13.96. On the same page $13.07 is given as the amount of wages for 67 hours at 21 cents per hour; the amount should be $14.07. The algebraic formulae on page 49 is in part incorrect ; it should appear as follows
