NEW PATENT STAIR.

Mr. Joseph Lea of the Canadian Ornamental Iron Company, Toronto, is the patentee of a new stair illustrated herewith, which is characterized by extreme simplicity in construction, and in nearness and beauty of finish.

The interlocking device of riser and tread constitutes one of the best features of the patent. The riser and tread thus interlocked and bound to the strings by tension boils result in a construction which in strength and rigidity are claimed 10 be unparalled in stair construction.

Moreover, it is estimated that there will be a reduction of 30 to 40 per cent, ill the weight of material used.

With the use of this patent the Construction of stairs may be





































































of steel throughout and the permanent steel treads will render temporary treads unnecessary. It is further claimed that this patent will make possible the specification of stair building

the material will be on hand—-delays and expense unavoidable in pattern making and foundry work, together with tile fitting and drilling of brackets, string, risers and treads, will be obviated and it will be possible to put the Stairs in position on briefest notice.

This should be a boon to architects and contractors to whom the necessary use of ladders and temporary stairs has been hitherto an unavoidable bughear.
