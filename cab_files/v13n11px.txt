FRENCH POTTERY.

<article title=" FRENCH POTTERY " author="">

ACCORDING to Engineering, the total value of porcelain made in France is about thirty-three million francs (f1,320,000); of this goods to the extent of 12 or 13 million francs are exported to various countries, England being the principal customer. The manufacture of the high quality faience was introduced from England into France at the beginning of the century; during the last forty years the industry has been very widely extended. The total production of this class of ware

France is valued at twenty million of francs naturally, the larger proportion of this is used in the country, but the volume of exports is relatively considerable. The making of hard faience is to-day of small amount, since the better class, with white paste and transparent glaze, has been made; now the industry is chiefly reserved for some classes of tiles, for stoves, and a few other uses.

The jury appointed to enquire into the cause of the failure of the wall of a Presbyterian church in course of erection at Vankleek Hill, Ont., reported that the accident was due to the use of inferior material and the lack of proper bonding. The County Grown Attorney has expressed

the opinion that the verdict should have stated positively who was to blame for the collapse.
