(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



TAKING a review of building matters for the past season, the 'Ambitious City can compare favorably with former years. There has

not, of course, been the great rush of works that characterized former years, but we have had several large buildings erected which gave employment to a considerable number of workmen, besides a number of private villa residences of which you have been notified from time to time.

Our new City Hall is now finished. Its internal arrangement is said to be very good, and considering the cost of the building, the exterior has a very imposing appearance indeed, and reflects credit on the designer, with the exception of the steps, which evidently detract from the general effect.

Our <building>Y. M. C. A. building, Hamilton </building>on James Street is also completed. It is a large plain brick building, without any effort at exterior decoration, but the interior is judiciously arranged.

The new <building>Free Library building, Hamilton </building>is in course of erection, and promises to be a very fine building when finished.

The large new school on Queen Street is a brick building with cut stone dressing and pointed arches, and is a very substantial, well-finished piece of work. There is also a new school just completed on Wentworth street, similar in character and design to the one on Queen street.

The Court House in Prince Square is having new stone steps to the front entrance in place of the old ricketty step that were originally built, but it is feared that the new steps when finished, will not in appearance at least, give the satisfaction expected. There will be an easier ascent, but the style and effect will be wanting, for like the old steps the new ones will not have rounded nosings on the tread, which would give a massive and finished appearance to them. Neither in this case nor in that of the new city hall steps was the style of step approved of by the designers, for reasons no doubt known to themselves although not to others. We have had material changes and alterations made by the architect in the audience floor or court room, with the idea of improving the acoustic properties, but without any other effect than that of making bad worse. Sooner or later, however, the work must be properly and effectually done, for at present it is impossible even to hear the judge address the jury, so badly is the room arranged for the purpose required.

The new <building>Presbyterian Church, Hamilton </building>on King and Emerald streets, is now ready for roofing. It will evidently be a neat and well designed building when completed.

T	of St. John street (within the walls) is now well advanced. exceptions, all buildings have been either demolished

or the fronts have been set back. It is to be regretted that in some instances in which the old buildings have been remodelled, owing to the lowness of the stories and shallowness of the buildings, the results have been far from pleasing in others, where the buildings have been of rather more modern build, more satisfactory results have been obtained. Of entirely new buildings, only seven have been erected they are as follows: <person>George T. Phillips</person>, two stores and dwellings, 53 ft. front, to cost about architect, <person>H. Staveley</person>, contractors, <firm>C. Cote & Co. </firm>for the masonry,

<person>A. Cummings </person>carpenter <person>S. J. Shaw, </person>store and dwelling, 30 ft. front, to cost about $6,000, same architect as above and same mason, <person>John Hatch</person>, carpenter Savings Bank, store and dwelling 22 ft. front, to cost about $6,000, <person>J. F. Peachey </person>architect, <person>L. Larose</person>, mason, and <person>F. DeVarennes</person>, carpenter. All the foregoing have plate glass shop fronts, upper stories of Deschambault cut stone, with molded caps, strings, carved capitals, &c. Ursuline Ladies, one store and two dwellings, 30 ft. front, plate glass shop front, and pressed red brick with stone trimmings, will cost about $7000.

<person>F. X. Berlinguet </person>architect, <person>T. Pampalon </person>and <person>E. Matte</person>, contractors. <person>Joseph Dynes</person>, one store and dwelling, 40 feet front, white brick with stone trimmings to cost $7,000, <person>H. Stavely </person>architect. <person>A. Cummings</person>, contractor.

<person>D. Ouellet </person>two stores and dwellings, 35 ft. front, red brick, painted and blocked off to represent stone, plate glass front to shops, to cost about

<person>McGreevy</person>,

$8,000, D. Ouellet, architect. R. H.	two stores and dwellings, plate glass fronts, upper stories of pressed red brick with pilasters of same



dividing under frieze into two smaller pilasters, each capped with carved stone capitals, will cost about $9,000; architect, H. Staveley, contractors. L. Larose and W. 1. Peters.

As an outcome of the widening of St. John street it may be mentioned that

the	rnois, being obliged to vacate

well known photographer, Mr. <person>J. E. Live</person>

the premises he formerly occupied, purchased from the Heirs McClure the

extensive property at the junction of St. John Fabrique and Garneau streets, at one time known as Dexter's Hotel, which has been transformed into a model photographic establishment. The lower story of the main building is to be used as a salesroorn for photographic and artists' materials, and frames for pictures. A handsome recessed portico, with broad stone steps, upon which rest enriched iron columns to carry the front wall above, gives entrance to this room. The woodwork, cherry stained, with decorated walls and ceiling, and floor of black walnut and brick, with an elegant staircase leading to the salon on the second story, make up a very handsome apartment. A room of corresponding size, handsomely decorated, forms the salon from which opens dressing rooms. Passing these the gallery is reached, having a splendid north light located in the

wing. Other rooms also in the wing serve the various purposes required by a photographer, viz., dark room, solar room, printing room, negative room, bath room, &c. Returning to the main building, and mounting to the third story, are found the artists' rooms, where coloring and other processes are carried on. The business room of the proprietor is also on this flat. '[he whole work has been done by day's work, <person>F. DeVarennes </person>and <person>T. Pampalon</person>, having charge of the carpentering and masonry respectively, with Mr.<person> B. Leonard </person>as painter and decorator, and Z. Vandez, heating apparatus and sanitary arrangements. Stained glass from <firm>Spence & Sons </firm>of Montreal, and engraved glass from <firm>Elliot & son, Toronto</firm>. Mr. <person>H. Staveley, </person>architect, designed and superintended the various works <person>Mr. Livernois </person>having spared no expense, has succeeded in securing an establishment that is admirable in every way for his purposes.

(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)

S

EVERAL letters have of late been published in our local papers claiming that our builders amass wealth too rapidly in Montreal. This is rather too broad a statement, as I think an investigation would prove that it is the exception to find them possessed of more than their share of this world's goods. T rue some few have" struck oil" as the saying is, and are now considered fairly well of; but why growl? Why attack the honest mechanic who earns his bread by the sweat of his brow? Why not as well say our merchants are getting too rich, therefore they must charge too much for their merchandise ? Why single out the builder from the rest of the community? Look how the brewers and tavern keepers make money; in their case it is the exception to find a poor one yet no one raises a cry. It is only when a contractor or two has been successful, that some envious land grabber' or speculator, in all probability, finds fault because he wishes to build at his own prices and pocket the proceeds. There is one thing at least that we can boast of, and that is as a rule our buildings are substantial, even if they do cost a trifle more than in the States

CITY HALL NOTES.

Under this head recently I mentioned the granting leave of absence and bonuses to city employees. We are now reaping the fruits, as will be seen by the following extract from the Star. The Road Department is one of those things that no fellow can understand. The acting chairman, <person>Alderman Wilson</person>, says he has been away for the summer, so he does not pretend to understand it. <person>Alderman Dubuc</person>, on the other hand, says he has not been away at all, and yet he does not understand it either. All that the general public know about the Department is that it costs about a quarter of a million dollars a year; that it has never got any money when improvements are asked for but that notwithstanding this fact it manages to block the main thoroughfares of the city for the best part of the year. Somebody has been spending the department's last cent and plunging it into debt, and nobody seems to know who did the deed or who authorized it. The Road Committee asks for a special appropriation of $4,500 to remove the greenhouses from Viger gardens to Logan's farm and the Finance Committee refuses to grant the money. Thereupon somebody assumes the responsibility of getting the work done and leaves to the Road Committee the responsibility of paying for it. The situation is further complicated by the fact that the Road Committee whether willing to pay or not has not got the money. The work was done when Mr. St. George was away on vacation and Mr. Lavelle was in charge. Now explanations are in order, but, unfortunately, Mr. Lavalle is away on vacation. There is no place where the city's\ by-laws and regulations are so set at defiance as in the City Hall.'

<assoc>CANADIAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS.</assoc>



At the first meeting of the season, a paper was read on Bridge Calculations.' At the November meeting we are promised a paper by Mr. <person>S. Keefer</person>, M. C. Soc., on the Cornwall Canal, which, owing to recent breaks, etc.. will probably be one of the most interesting papers of the session.

FLOOD PROTECTION AN D HARBOR I M PROVEMEN TS.



This question is daily becoming an important one for Montreal, because, 1st, we must be protected from spring and fall floods 2nd, our increasing trade demands increased wharf accommodation 3rd, ratepayers are shortly to be called upon to vote a million of money as the city's share of the undertaking. It would take more time and space than 1 have at my disposal to give even a synopsis of the various schemes suggested, without commenting thereon. The question is too important and involves too many engineering difficulties to be treated in an offhanded way. So far the public have hardly sufficient light upon the proposed improvements to be able to even vote intelligently on the by-law to raise a million dollars, which they will be shortly called upon to do. As I understand it, there has been a sort of a combination between our City Council and a <assoc>Committee of the Harbor Commissioners, Montreal </assoc>to consider the proposed improvements, and at a meeting held on the 14th June, 1888, it was resolved - -That it appears expedient in the interest of the city and harbor of Montreal that there should be joint action in plans covering the following improvements : i. An elevation of the front of the city securing the city from flood inundations. 2. A sufficiently commodious street, enlarging the present Commissioners street. 3. A plan of harbor improvements specific in detail, in so far as it may connect with the city improvements above referred to. 4. The appointment of the City and Harbor Engineers to furnish plans providing for above improvements, make estimates of
