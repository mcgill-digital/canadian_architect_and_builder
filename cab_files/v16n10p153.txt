<article title=" A Commendable Work " author="">

The Canadian Club of Toronto A Commendable Work is performing a valuable public

service by marking historic spots in the city and vicinity. During the last five years the Club has placed bronze tablets bearing suitable inscriptions on a number of ancient buildings and on new buildings erected on the site of ancient structures which were the scene of no able occurrences in the early history of the city and province.



<article title="Hours in the Wages and Working Building Trades " author="">

Hours in the Wages and Working Building Trades. An interesting table is published in the September number of the Canadian Labour Gazette, showing the changes that have taken place in working hours and wages of mechanics in the building trades in Canada during the present year. In ten towns and cities the wages of bricklayers and masons were increased by $2.00 to $3.00 per week ; in fifteen towns and cities the wages of carpenters were increased from 25 cents to $3.00 per week. In Montreal, plasterers obtained an increase of $1.36 per week, and in Toronto $2. 20. Wages of plasterers' laborers also advanced by $2.20 per week. Painters, decorators and paperhangers in eight cities got increases ranging from 65 cents per week in Montreal to $2.78 in St. Catharines. The wages of plumbers and gas fitters in six cities show advances ranging from 50 cents

per week in St. Catharines to $5.33 in New Westminster, B. C. Stonecutters were given increases ranging from $1.50 to $4.00 per week, and builders' laborers of 28 cents to $2. 10 per week. Coupled with this general rise in wages there were in many instances reductions in the number of working hours.

<article title=" The Eiffel Tower " author="">

The municipal authorities of

The Eiffel Tower	Paris have in view the purpose of transforming the Champ de

Mars into a park. This means that the portion of the site of the Exhibition of 1900 lying south of the Seine, must be cleared, and that seven years hence, when the concession for the Eiffel tower will expire, that great and novel structure will disappear, and with it the most conspicuous modern landmark of Paris. For boldness of conception, and as an example of original and artistic design, the Eiffel Tower deserves to rank, as it has done since its erection, among the wonders of the world, and the necessity for its removal will be generally regretted.

		Attention is being called by the

	Wall Papers	technical press of Great Britain

		to the fact that the export trade

in wall papers to Germany from Great Britain is diminishing. A few years ago British manufactured wall papers were in large demand in Germany and a
