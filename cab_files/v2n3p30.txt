<article title="Ottawa Institute of Architects" author="">OTTAWA INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS.

ON February 19th was held the first regular annual meeting

of the <assoc>Ottawa Institute of Architects</assoc>, originally set on foot for the purpose of improving and raising the status and efficiency of the profession of architects. This society, before completing its organization, drew up a comprehensive constitution and by-laws, suitable to the requirements of the locality, and from the commencement has looked forward to legal recognition in the Province, a by-law to that end being amongst its earliest regulations, requiring the executive to keep the object constantly in view.

Owing to the illness of Mr. <person>Thomas Fuller</person>, President, Mr.

<person>King Arnoldi </person>delivered an address from which the following extracts have more than local interest

"Our members may not altogether realize the important position that such an Institute must attain ; how by proper management it must become a real and substantial advantage to every individual member ; and a position achieved for it that will bring appreciative approbation from the general public, placing at a positive disadvantage any architect attempting to practise in our midst who may not be one of us. Without association we might indeed be acquainted more or less, but we all know, in such a state of affairs, the antagonism and jealousy that seem fated to exist between members of the same calling—how often through misunderstanding, wrong motives are imputed, and any way, a miserable competition carried on, certainly not to the advantage of any one. Meeting together, acquaintanceship will remove such asperities, and we shall look to one another for counsel and aid in solving such difficult problems as may present themselves.

"This is how I interpret 'maintaining a proper standard of

professional ethics'. 

"I will now present to you the views I entertain as to what our future programme should be Till now, our energies have been principally devoted to the perfection of our organization. In this we may congratulate ourselves, having almost every practising architect in the city on our roll, and I would like to make our Institute of such importance that no architect will be able to afford to remain outside. Of the numerous guerillas, they will continue to exist. Their status has been fully considered by your council, and the inadvisability of admitting them to membership has, after mature deliberation, been decided upon.

"Now, having associated ourselves for the decent practice of the profession, and having adopted the lowest scale of charges known amongst qualified architects, it would be a pity for it to go abroad that we have formed a "combine," which I have no doubt will be the title some may be inclined to apply to us.

	*	*



" In any action affecting us, we should be the first movers. For instance, the city of Ottawa requires a building by-law, therefore the corporation should be communicated with, and the co-operation of the Institute offered towards its perfection, our influence being used to see that the Inspector under it is a person in whom we have confidence. This is a matter that if not attended to, may be the source of much annoyance to our profession.



	*	*	*	*	*	*

"Our by-laws as to affiliation must not stop at a simple exchange of courtesies ; the object to be kept in view must be the recognition of ours as a close profession, similar to lawyers, doctors, land-surveyors and civil engineers. This will require a great deal of labor, and the co-operation of all now practising in the entire Province. Our Toronto confreres are moving in the matter, and we must lend them active assistance. Much time and some expense will be involved in this, but to carry out the

objects of our association we should be prepared to spend both time and money, since in all the matters I have pointed out, we can depend on receiving a return that will amply repay us.

"Our worthy first president, in relinquishing his office, does so from conviction that for him to hold this position would be to defeat the objects we have in view. He considers that every officer should give time and active work to the interests of the Institute, and these he does not find himself able to give. I would therefore express the hope that the officers for the ensuing year, to be elected at this meeting, will be prepared, in exercising their functions, to attend closely to the interests of our society—will be prepared to sacrifice some of their valuable time in the common interest—so that with the co-operation of our own members and the architects of the Province generally, we may attain by the next session of the Provincial Parliament a position or status for our profession which it has not previously attained in any other part of the British or American world."

Mr. King Arnoldi was afterwards elected president for the

year 1889—90.

HE third annual convention of the <assoc>National Association of Master Builders of the United States</assoc>, was held in the Franklin Institute,

Philadelphia. Pa. on Feb. 12th, 13th and 14th. The gathering embraced about three hundred builders and contractors from all parts of the United States. A synopsis of the proceedings at this convention should prove interesting and instructive to Canadian master builders, especially in view of the expressed desire for a somewhat similar association for the Province of Ontario.

2. The preliminary training in the trade school to be followed by a term of practice with an employer on actual work, this term to be at least one year less than the usual term of apprenticeship by virtue of the holding of a certificate of proficiency granted by a mechanical trade school. During this term of service the young man to be known as a "junior."

3. Finally, completion of the education of the mechanic to be acknowledged after a proper examination has been passed before a board of examiners appointed for the purpose by the association of builders to which the employer may belong, or to whom the junior may apply for examination by the issuance of a certificate by the said association, which shall state that the holder has passed through the prescribed course at the trade school, and the term of practice with an employer (name and location given) with satisfaction and credit, and is entitled to be received by all builders as a journeyman. Any young man who has received the "certificate of proficiency" from the trade school may apply for the second examination before the board of examiners, and, if adjudged by them to be old enough, strong enough, and competent, may receive a special certificate, which shall state the facts in the case

A special Committee was appointed to take this matter in charge and
