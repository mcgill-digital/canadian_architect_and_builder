	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	BUILDER



Mr. F. F. Skinner, who spent the greater part of the past summer in Montreal, in the interests of the Gurney Foundry Co., reports a recent improvement in business conditions in that city.



A valuable polishing stone quarry has been discovered and is about to be developed at Rockport, N.B. There are five seams in red, brown and slate color, and differing slightly in quality.

These stones have been tested by practical marble workers in Canada and the United States, and have been highly recommended, rivaling pumice stone, and where there are hard spots in marble proving much better. Some of these stones also make good whet and oil stones. There is also in this property a fine quality of brown building stone, but not as yet developed enough to show its value.
