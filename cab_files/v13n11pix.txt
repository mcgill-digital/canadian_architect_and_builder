BUILDING STONE QUARRIES

OF NEW BRUNSWICK.

THE Northumberland Stone Co.,

of Shediac, N.B., of which Mr. W.

B.	Deacon is manager, has been turning out some good stone this year which is attracting considerable attention. The quarries are on the coast at Buctouche, Kent Co., N. B., and have good shipping facilities by both water and rail. The stone is an olive green freestone, and is said to have no sand pockets and is not affected by iron rust. A large ten tenement building standing in front of the Governor's gardens in Quebec was constructed of this stone last year by the contractor, Mr. Simon Peters under the supervision of Mr. R. Findlay, architect, of Montreal.

Another quarry in that vicinity is that of C. Pick and at Sackville, who ships a light brown stone, making a specialty of large dimension material. This is thought by some to he one of the firmest freestones in Canada. Mr. Pickard has a cube of a size 3" x 3" which, in a test at McGill University, was partially crushed when undergoing a horizontal crushing pressure of 81,000 pounds. This stone was used in the construction of the new Mount Allison residence at Sackville and in the new Science Building at Truro. Considerable has been shipped to Ottawa this year. Mr. Pickard has a letter from Messrs. Burke &

Horwood, architects, of Toronto, which is a good recommendation of the stone in quality and colorâ€”also one from Messrs. Rhodes, Curry & Co., of Amherst. A modern ball-bearing derrick, with lifting capacity of 25 tons, has just been placed in the quarry.



Quebec was recently the scene of another land-slide, which fortunately was not attached by injury or loss of life. This was due to the fact that the accident occurred at an early hour in the morning. Four hundred feet of the cliff at Levis gave way, bunging Commercial street a depth of twenty feet.

Still pursuing its experiments in the line of seeking to diminish fire risks by every possible contrivance, the British Fire Prevention committee recently made another test, from which some interesting results were obtained. On this occasion a match board partition was filled in with silicate cotton (slag wool), and the flames were allowed to come in contact with one side.

The fire burned for three-quarters of an hour--the temperature rising from 300 degrees Fahr,. to 1,800 degrees Fahr. This was followed by the application of water for two minutes on the outside, and one minute on the inside. After reaching a temperature of 1,365 degrees Fahr. in twenty-eight minutes, the fire broke through the upper part of the partition. In forty minutes, with a temperature of only 1,450 degrees Fahr., the upper part of the partition was on fire in several places, and at these points no slag wool could be seen. Inside, the boarding was consumed, as were also some of the studs passing from the outside to the inside. On the outside, where it was protected by the silicate cotton, the boarding was not affected, although the temperature at the last was 1,725 degrees Fahr. These results were at least interesting.
