<doctype type="text">	C	AND BUILDER	November, 1888of good work by increasing the number of thoroughly trained men. The work of the best men must necessarily always be in advance of the art intelligence of the community, and then the task of educating the masses is thrown upon them. This work is at first disparagingly spoken of, and not until it is understood, does it meet with general approval. They must be satisfied with the admiration of their designs by the cultured and refined, which in itself would be sufficient, if they did not find it necessary to obtain the means of subsistence.It is to be hoped that much careful study will be given to working out the details of the scheme, and that every means of making the school thoroughly effective will be adopted. ______________________<article title=" OUR ILLUSTRATIONS " author=""> OUR ILLUSTRATIONSPARKDALE HIGH SCHOOLT This building, which is now in course of erection, is red brick, with brown stone and terra cotta trimmings, and covers an area of i 11,500 square feet.

TIMEWELL I In a country where a comfortable habitation for both man and beast is so essential to the comfort, success, and happiness of the farmer, and profitable renumeration tothe owners .of the latter, a few remarks upon the above subject you could perhaps find space for in your valuable journal.Foundations of buildings must always he a very important factor, and I have found that owing perhaps to the extreme dryness or the severity of the trost in this country, that it is not so necessary to excavate below frost line (as it is called) as in othercountries where the frost is not so intense, except for projections.such as porticos, verandahs, steps, &c., and very light buildings. The posts do not heave under the main buildings. A thorough good foundation may be obtained by placing tamarac or- cedar plank sufficiently wide and thick to form a base, on the virgin prairie, care being taken not to disturb the original turf. The roots of the grass, weeds, &c. are so tough and interlaced with each other, that they will support a very heavy framed structure. The foundation planking and sills above shoud receive a coat of creosote tar, or even limewhite, before being laid, and covered with earth. While advocating the above class of foundation. I do not wish to be understood to say that it is the best, but I have proved it to be good, and in a new country where expense is necessarily considered, it certainly meets the economical requirements of the people, more especially as in order to secure a more substantial foundation of concrete stone, &c., it is necessary to excavate so very deep to get through the top soil of rich black loam, that unless a solid bottom of shale, gravel, &c., is arrived at, it is not well to place hard substances with irregular surfaces, such as stones, upon a yielding substance, except in the case of the best Portland cement concrete, carefully and properly prepared and filled in the trenches to a depth of say three feet. Even this is generally ruled out because of the expense, although owing to the great adhesive properties of this material, and_its well known resistance to a great transverse and tensile strain, if expense is not an object, this is no doubt the best foundation. Even concrete, however, should be laid on a hard bottom. While' on the subject of concrete, I will say at once that I consider this material from every point of view the very besi for construction of all classes of farm buildings, owing to its being fire proof. everlasting, impervious to vermin, and in most parts of the country, the cheapest material that can be used. TheThe contractors were Messrs. Dixon & Bazin, the architect. Mr. E. Charest.St. John street (without the walls) has been embellished this season by the completion of Hetherington's Block, built on the same design as the portion erected last year, and pressed bnck front and cutstone trimmings. Over the gateway leading to the factory yard, an oriel window has been erected, running up through two stories. The windows have leaded lights with bands of glazed tiles between the same; the whole terminates with cast iron cresting The shop and offices occupy the front floor. The floors are laid with tiles. counters made by D. S. Rickaly, of cherry, with walnut mouldings, birdseye maple panels and red marble top. .The new building completes the arrangements which the Messrs. Hethering ton have been wanting for some years to enable them 10 carry on a very extensive plain and rancy biscuit manufacturing trade. The cost of the new building approximates $7,000. The structure was erected by Alex. Cummings. under the supervision of H.Staveley, architect.A rather unfrequent erection in Canada, the hanging of a chime of bells, is now going on in tbe tower of St. Matthew's Cburch. They number eight, and weigh altogether close on 600 lbs. They are from the Warners, and are fitted with a chi chiming apparatus, although it is intended to have them rung by a guild of young men. The total cost of the bells including selling in place will be about $2,600. The Anglican Cathedral chimes hung 50 odd years ago, weighed nearly 800 lbs. few cities in Canada -can- boast of twoHAMILTON.<article title="Correspondence - HAMILTON " author="">(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER)The "Ambitious CITY" is decidedly on the march of improvement in the building line, as is evidenced by the decidedly growing taste for good design and modern sanitary improvements. Some of the villa residences now being erected in the suburbs reflect much credit on the designers. The fronts are generally done in—red stock brick, and tuckpointed. The arches and Strings being done in red, white and black brick, which will give an effective appearance. In the better class of residences, cut stone is used in the dressing with good effect and, in this connection, to what perfection  can the craft of bricklaying be brought for exterior decoration. Formerly brickwork was perfectly devoid of design—nothing more than filling in between cut stone dressing. Now, with the improvements in the mold in which the bricks can be formed in any shape, bevelled or moulded, and the improved chemical process of coloring the brick in different tints, the architect has a fair field for showing good design at moderate cost. It can be seen in some of the tastefully finished brick fronts in the cities of the United States, and toa great extent in Toronto and elsewhere. More than the ordinary bricklayer's skill will be required ch fronts. None but first-class workmen can be employed, for no matter how good the design may be, and the material of the best quality, still, if the work is not done in a first-class manner, the desired effect is lost. _In fact, the time is coming when tbe bricklayer's trade will be more than a mere labor occupation. This advantage can be attained with the favorable opportunities now afforded toprevent the access of water and dampness, and which will also withstand extreme and varying temperatures of air, and which will be practically indestructible. The composition consists of the following ingredients, combined in s substantially the proportions stated, viz: New Zealand (or Portland) cement, 100 (pounds:cream of tartar, 3 ounces pulverized ivory 1 ounce quicksilver. 1 ounce; isinglass 4 ounces: marble dust, pounds; sand, 200 pounds; rainwater, 1 pail. In compounding the ingredients, a small quantity of cement, for instance one pound. is mixed with the cream of tartar, quicksilver and isinglass and water enough to make a very thin paste, and the composition is let stand about twenty-four hours. lithe weather be cold the composition should stand in a warm place. The remainder of the cement, the pulverized ivory, marble dust and sand are mixed dry, and the standing composition is thereupon added, together with enough rain water, about half a pail, to produce a plastic mass capable of being readily laid with a trowel or similar implement. After the compound is laid upon a suitable foundation, such as wood, earth, brick or metal, it becomes very hard, equal to steel, and capable of a very high polish.Building operations in Winnipeg during the present year are expected to aggregate a quarter of a million dollars.The McClary Manufacturing Co., of London, Ont., will erect a new four-storey building which will contain recreation and reading rooms for their employees. The British Architect quotes from the Estate Clerk-of- Works a discussion on the relative advantages of different sorts of roof-covering for farm-buildings. most of the participants in the discussion approve of dies, as being handsome and durable, and giving when well laid, a very perfect roof. One person, however. prefers slate to tile, for the reason that tiles retain moisture, and to the woodwork under them, while, the timber-	under slate roofs are almost always found dry and perfect. Another speaks of oak shingles as forming a Rood roof material, which when. well nailed with zinc or copper will last for centuries; while a third recommends roofs thatched with reeds, which remain good for fifty years or more and form a covering which iswarm in winter and cool in summer, and is thus well adapted for  stables and cattle-sheds. Another roof which is mentioned is weimagine new. in this country, and consists simply of tarred felt,  whitewashed outside. The whitewash is made with lime and skim-milk, and is renewed every spring. During the summer it reflects the sunlight, k keeping the rooms under it cool and in winter -it helps to preserve the felt from- the weather, besides, no doubt,checking in some degree the radiation of the interior warmth. So far as we know, shingle roofs are the only sort which are ever whitewashed here. These are occasionally treated with lime-wash  and alum to preserve them, but .the effect of the whitewash in repelling the heat of the sun is little thought of although in our hot           practice of painting roofs white, as is done in China, and in Southern France, would certainly be-American Architectwalls, floors, and even roof can all be built of concrete composed in the following manner :—Three parts of stone or gravel broken into small irregular pieces about two inches in diameter, and twopans of sharp clean -sand or ashes, to one part of fresh— well-burnt lime, powdered or ground to a powder. The component parts should be carefully measured and mixed dry, and hen well wetted and dumped into position. In the event of good Portland cement being used instead of lime, nearly double the proportion of broken stone would be a proper quantity. In all cases hollow walls, or outer and inner walls with an air space between, should be built. Wood sides three feet high, made of boards fixed together with ledges should be placed on edge the required thickness of the wall apart, and a core or box, 4 inches thick. should be placed in the centre to form an air space. A round block of wood should be placed in the position required for chimneys, shafts, &c.. and the door and window frames fixed where required. The wet mass of concrete is then to be dumped into the mould formed by the boards, and large stones can be pressed into the soft concrete in the centre of walls. This is to be continued round the building sufficient time being given to allow the concrete to set. The same boards, cores, &c., can then be removed, and fixed on the top of the wall. he same process being repeated until the full height of he storey is attained, inserting wood. bricks, lintels, plates, &c., as required. The outside of the wall. if lime concrete is used, should be rendered in Portland cement, to protect it from the weather. This work can all be done by unskilled labor. Should floors and roof 'of concrete be desired, it must be made with cement, with old railway iron or light flanged girders inserted every three feet in width. The properties of concrete and the method for using the same, is so well known to nearly all your readers that perhaps there was not any necessity to go into so much detail.QUEBEC. -<article title="Correspondence - QUEBEC " author="">(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)The prospect of widening St. John street (within the walls) are improving. The city council has been empowered by the LocalLegislature to issue bonds to the extent of $100,000 for the purpose. A good start may be made with this sum, but a further amount will undoubtedly be required. It is to be regretted that the proprietors, generally speaking, demand the high figures they do, especially in view of the fact that the value of real estate in this street has fallen so low that in many instances not more than 30 or 40 per cent of the former rents can be obtained - this being largely due to the miserable narrowness of the street. Naturally the business has left for the wider and more open streets, where people may move about with some comfort. The lot occupied formerly by the Proran building. and acquired some time ago by the corporation and subsequently sold to Dr. Casgrain, has been utilized by that gentleman. who has erected on the new line a dwelling and dental office on one half of-the lot. purposing next season to build upon the remainder. The new building bas twotrimmings, neat but inexpensive; the cost bas been about $600.young mechanics to improve their time by studying in the Schools of Art and Design, and also in reading the periodicals bearing onArchitecture.	(	___It is generally conceded now	of the late strikes are fading away from the minds of the people. It is to be hoped that a repetition of the folly will not occur in the ensuing spring. If not there can be no doubt of a good season of business in the building trades. experience has taught the Union a severe lesson, and we may reasonably hope that in future they will conduct matters with care and discretion. /I regret to say, that our city fathers have so far made no perceptible effort   compel the record of new buildings. Only one half of the buildings commenced here have been entered in the Inspector's book. Some excuse may be made, however, as I understand the inspector, Mr. Morrison, has been for some weeks confined to his home with sickness, but it is to be hoped that when he is again able to attend to his duties, he - will straighten out matters effectually.OTTAWA (Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)<article title="Correspondence - OTTAWA " author="">Since my last report building operations have been very brisk, the greatest drawback being want of sufficient hands to carry out the work under contract. As in former years contractors take hold of all the jobs they can get early in the season, without calculating how they are going to get through with them at the close of the season, with the limited number of bands here; whereas some contractors have not anything to do. This state of affairs necessitates a great deal of trouble to the architect, and loss	(0 the proprietor.		___	____A committee consisting of the two city Engineers and the Chief of the Fire Department, along with architects Hodgson, Bowes, and Alexander, were appointed by the city council to draft a bylaw for the guidance of a building inspector to be appointed. The committee have completed their labors. The draft of the by-law will be submitted to a special meeting of the city council next week.___		and if adopted, an inspector will at once be appointed. Alreadyabout fifty applications have been sent in. It is to be hoped acompetent man will receive-the> appointment, otherwise the by-lawwill be a dead letter.	- - -The competitive plans for the new police station have been finally disposed of. the plans of J. R. Bowes having been adopted. The-building is now underway, and will cost about $15,000.A great deal of dissatisfaction exists amongst the architects here regarding the manner of letting out contracts, the custom being to let out the different trades to separate contractors, in consequence of which the architect is compelled to look after six contractors on each job, whereas if the work was let to one man, it would be less trouble to the architect, and more satisfactory to the proprietor, because under the present method the contractor puts the responsibility of all delays on the shoulder of the next contractor. An effort will be made next season (0 adopt the bulk tender system.
