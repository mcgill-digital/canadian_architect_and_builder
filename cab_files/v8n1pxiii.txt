DANUBE



AT Munderkingen, Germany, says one of the English journals, a concrete bridge has been constructed over the Danube with a single arch of 164 feet span and 24 feet 6 inches wide. The abutments are of concrete on piles at an angle of 15 with the vertical, and are of considerable width, to equalize the pressure over the piles. A pressure of 15 tons per square foot is obtained on the rock abutment on one side, while on the other the pressure is less than 3 tons per square foot, this being on gravel and piles. To increase the security, joints were made at each abutment and at the crown; these joints allow the crown to rise and sink without causing cracks. The arch has a rise of 16 feet 4 inches in the center. Calculations were made for a live load of 82 pounds per square foot, and the thickness at crown is 3.28 feet and 3.61 feet at the abutments. The arch curve was determined  experimentally, and is approximately the line of pressure under full loads. On the left side the arch has a radius of 213 feet; on the other half two-thirds of the soffit has a radius of 230 feet and the remainder 151 feet. From the description it will be seen that the arch forms two rigid segments of concrete, jointed or hinged at the abutments and crown, and these joints have abutting surfaces of steel in I 2 separate parts in the width of bridge. These devices distribute the abutting pressure on steel bars over the concrete section of arch. The Portland cement used came from Ehingen Blaubeuren, and was of a fineness to pass a 5,800-mesh sieve.
