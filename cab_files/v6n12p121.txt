MUCH interest is felt in the Competition for a new City Hall for the City of New York. The competition closed on the first of September. The number of designs submitted was 137, the competitors representing the United States, England, and we understand, Canada also. The proposed Cost of the buildings 15 $7,000,000. It is estimated that the architect's commissions will amount to about $800,000. Much regret is expressed that owing to ill health Mr. Richard M. Hunt is unable to serve on the architectural committee selected to aid the building Commissioners in deciding the competition.



AT the annual meeting of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers, t() bc held in January, action will be taken on the report of the Committee on Professional Status. The report recommends that land surveyors should be prevented from practising as civil engineers, unless they belong to the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers; that an appeal should be made in each pro to have members of the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers recognized as professional men, with right to collect fees that no practitioner shall be entitled to designate himself as a civil engineer unless lie belongs to the Canadian Society of Civil Engineers.



As a means of making the meetings more instructive and entertaining the Chairman of the Builders' and Contractors' Association of Victoria, N. S. W., recently invited the reading of papers by the members of that body. Who should know, he said, more about the structural portion of edifices than the men who built them, and who were better fitted to expound the laws and regulations affecting them? Even if the papers were merely reminiscent, they would provide better subjects for discussion than the payment of fees and various irrelevant topics. The attention of the officers of the Toronto Builders' Exchange was recently called in these columns to this subject. Papers and discussions on topics connected with building would tend to enliven the meetings of the Exchange throughout the winter; the interchange of experiences and opinions would be mutually helpful, and in giving expression to their views the members would derive intellectual advantage. We hope an attempt will be made to put the suggestion into practice.





THE manufacturers of Canadian cement are complaining of the action of the Dominion Government in using imported cement in the Construction of the Soulanges canal. This is the first instance so far as we arc aware in which imported cement has been used in Canadian public works of this character. In the construction of the Welland and Sault Ste. Marie canals Canadian cement was employed, and the durability of the material in the case of the Welland canal at least has been amply demonstrated. No reason has been given by the Government for the use of imported cement in the Soulanges canal except that they felt bound to act on the advice of their engineer. It is due, we think, to the manufacturers of Canadian cement that they should know the reasons which prompted the engineer to advise the Government to purchase foreign material, more especially in view of the fact that the native material has undergone such satisfactory tests, and that the cement manufacturing industry in Canada affords employment to a considerable number of persons. In addition to this, the purchasing abroad of what can be obtained at home, is contrary to the policy of encouraging native industries which has been a prominent feature of the Government's platform.
