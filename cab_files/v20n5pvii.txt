CONTRACTOR LESS EXPENSIVE.



A bill is proposed in the Wisconsin legislature to enable cities to construct their own paving work, instead of making it obligatory to have it done by contract. There is an exemption in favor of macadam work, but other forms must be laid by contract. The use of day labor for city work is not always as satisfactory as its advocates would like to have it appear. The opportunity to employ a number of men offers an alluring invitation to pay off political debts or to make political obligations, and it has been known to happen that work by the day accomplishes far less than a contractor, working a crew of no greater number nor longer hours, is able to turn out.—Exchange.
