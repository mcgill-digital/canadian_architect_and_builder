As there seems to be a feeling of general prosperity throughout the country this year, the attendance of visitors at the Toronto Exhibition, which opens a few days hence, on the 28th inst., promises to exceed that of any previous year. Many who have never been to this great fair before are talking of going, and those who have been before arc going again. The entries in all departments, especially that of live stock, are the largest in its history,

and this is a pretty good indication that the exhibition will score another great success. Although some of the manufacturers of reapers and mowers have decided not to exhibit at any fair in future, there will still he a good exhibit of other farming implements at this exhibition. The special attractions, which will to a great extent he of a patriotic character and up to date, promise to be most interesting, including, among other things, a representation of the siege and relief of Mafeking, in the present South African war. Many interesting trophies, brought back by the re

turned members of the Canadian contingent, will he on exhibition. It is astonishing the great interest that is taken in the Toronto Fair throughout the country, and the approaching one is no exception. The usual cheap excursions will he given on all the railways.
