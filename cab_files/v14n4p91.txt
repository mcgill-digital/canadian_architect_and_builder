PROPOSED NEW BUILDING REGULATIONS.



The Fire and Light Committee of the Toronto City Council have approved of the following recommendations of the Federated Council of Building Trades: That when buildings under construction reach one storey in height the joists shall be covered or floored temporarily with one-inch boards, as each storey is built. In case of steel structures, where girders are 12 feet centres, two-inch plank shall be used with sufficient support in the centre. Where joists are over 16 inches and up to 48-inch centres ½-inch plank shall be used, and where six-foot centres, 2-inch plank. In builders' scaffolds the distance between standards shall bc eight feet instead of eight or ten, as formerly allowable. Where trestles are used the height is to be five feet and thc material substantial. When scaffolding is formed by putting trestles one upon another, not more than two trestles shall be used, each five feet high. Above the height of ten feet standard-ledger or ropes shall be used. A guard-rail shall bc built around the scaffold to prevent bricks falling, and another guard three feet above the scaffold to keep men from falling off.
