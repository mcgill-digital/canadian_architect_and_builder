<article title="modelling" author="Hynes, M. J.">"MODELING"

MR. <person>M. J. Hynes</person>, who lectured before the <building>Toronto Architectural Sketch Club </building>on the close

of the	sea-

son's	work,

took for his subject Modeling classifying modeling under three heads —first, modeling which is art, second, modeling which is unworthy of the name of art, and which for want of a better name is called "Romanesque." and third, the modeling of character.

He dwelt for some time on the Romanesque of the undiscovered periods which had been developed in America by Richardson, and regretted that the architects of Canada had not seen fit to deal with the natural foliage of their country, or to take up the Renaissance of the modern Italian treatment. On the third part he was sarcastic, without being personal, on the architects of the city, showing forth the advisability of the members of the Sketch Club developing the high standard of character which should belong to the profession.

In taking up the arts, Mr. Hynes undertook to criticize <person>Michaelangelo</person>'s " Moses," the placing of the arms on Venus de Medici, and the hands and arms of Venus de Milo, and presuming that the practical portion would he interesting to the students of the profession undertook to illustrate how these great works of art were reproduced from clay models. He also treated and illustrated the method by which the chains in marble were placed upon the Greek slave, and how the classic bronzes were reproduced in the present day. He dwelt for a considerable time on the mistakes we make in our details. His blackboard illustrations were crude, yet pointed. He reproduced, for example, some illusions, by which a matrix showed in bold relief, deceiving the eye of the most critical.

Mr. Hynes finished his remarks by reproducing a rough sketch in clay of the late <person>Sheriff Jarvis </person>an esteemed friend of his, and uncle of one of the architects present. Mr. Hynes stated that Mr. Frank Darling had presented the Sketch Club with the original models of the ornament for the improvements in the Dominion Bank, together with some of the lecturer's own work.



<assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.

ON Saturday afternoon, April 18th, a large number of the members met at the <building>Victoria Hospital </building>for Sick Children, and were kindly shown over it by Mr. <person>S. C. Curry</person>, who explained everything in detail and took great care to point out the various purposes of the buildings, making in this way the visit very  profitable.

The members then proceeded to the School of Practical Science, where Professors <person>Wright</person> and <person>Galbraith</person> courteously conducted them through the building. The testing machine proved extremely interesting, and some little time was consumed in listening to a description of the various uses to which the machine could he put. The fine collection of architectural photographs and specimens of students work were then examined.

During the course of the afternoon a photograph was taken of all present by Mr. <person>C. J. Gibson</person>, who intends presenting to the Club an enlarged copy. This is not the first time that Mr. Gibson's camera has been the means of making the Club indebted to him, as he made a present some time ago of several good specimens of his work, mounted and framed.

The competitive designs for a Staircase in Wood" " were on exhibition on Monday evening, April 27th, and as the critic,  Mr. <person>Frank Darling</person>, was unable to he present, on his suggestion each member gave a short criticism of the drawings from his own individual point of view, thus bringing out a variety of ideas. The drawing by Mr. <person>Murray A. White </person>was unanimously awarded first place.

At the close Mr. <person>S. G. Curry </person>made some practical remarks on staircases in general.

The last regular meeting of this season was held on May 18th when Mr. M. J. Hynes gave talk on Modeling," to

illustrate which he had sent some clay and necessary tools to the Club rooms, and in a practical way elucidated the mysteries of his subject. A synopsis of this talk is given in another column.

There will be a social gathering of the Club at the <building>Toronto Art Gallery </building>on Thursday, June 25th, and it is hoped that all friends and members of the Club will be present.

MONTREAL, May 21, 1891.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR, Would you kindly inform us of some preparations for coloring a Toronto pressed brick front built last fall, the plastering having been done during the winter. The mortar is a dark blue, and it is almost impossible to rub it off the bricks. By enlightening us on this subject, you will greatly oblige.

Yours truly,

J.	<firm>BRUNET & SON</firm>.



[It would be a pit)' to attempt to color pressed brick as suggested by our correspondent. The method adopted by bricklayers in Toronto for removing plaster stains on brickwork is its follows First scrub thoroughly with water and brush, then wash with muriatic acid, using a whitewash brush ; then scrub again with water and brush. The acid may be used in proportion of a half pint or a pint to a pail of water. If the set dressings are of Portage Entry stone, it will be necessary to carefully avoid letting the acid touch it. Credit Valley stone is uninjured by contact with the acid. ED. C. A. & B.]



STANSTEAD, QUE., May 16, 1891.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR, I wish you would make your . " Hand-Book larger and better, giving a basis for a contractor to work from in all branches of building. For example, the time required to lay M. brick 4", 8", 12" and 16" wall and a veneered wall, also examples of circular towers, arches, buttresses, and illustrate and show how height affects the time required (I use 15' for base, add 1-5th for every feet); time required to frame and put tip 1,000 scantlings, with several varying cases illustrated.

I think a book of this kind would sell. I would be glad, if got up on correct reasonings, to pay $5 or even $10 for one.

Yours truly,

<person>B. F. KIZAR</person>.

It would be a difficult and expensive matter to prepare a hand-book in the manner suggested by our correspondent which would be universally applicable. The rate of wages and value of materials vary so considerably in different localities that the information would be suitable for a limited number of localities only, unless elaborately gone into. The expense of preparing such a book in Canada would not be warranted by the prospective returns which might be looked for even by the most sanguine publisher. ED. C. A. & B.]



MONTREAL, June 15th, 1891.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—According do the resolution which was unanimously adopted at the annual meeting of the Province of Quebec Association of Architects, held in Montreal on the 10th and 11th of October, 1890, was it not decided to use the columns of the CONTRACT RECORD when calling for tenders? How is it then that so few Montreal architects comply with the above resolution, although many contracts are being let out ?

Yours truly,

 CONTRACTOR



[Such a resolution as our correspondent mentions was unanimously passed by the Quebec Association. We are not in a

position to give the reasons which may prompt individual machines of the Association to ignore the fulfillment of their promise.

We are in receipt of a copy of a new catalogue just issued by the <firm>Toronto Radiator Co</firm>. The cover is of black cardboard with the nature and address of the Company embossed thereon in copper and silver. An antique and artistic appearance has thus been gained, and one which marks a departure from previous publications of this character. This catalogue is distinctive also from the fact that it is the first published in Canada, anti the second in America, devoted exclusively to radiators. It contains 66 pages, in which are presented on tine plate paper handsome illustrations of the various sizes and styles of radiators manufactured by the Company, tables of prices, and a large amount of other data relating to the same.
