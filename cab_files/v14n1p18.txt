MR. Lennox, architect of the new Municipal Buildings at Toronto, states that there were used in the construction of these buildings 12,000,000 bricks and several hundred thousand feet of quarried dressed and cut stone. More material and workmanship is said to have gone into these buildings each year since 1892 than would be required to erect the largest office building in the city.

A WRITER in the Builders' Journal discusses the origin of the word 'Galilee" as applied to the porches of churches. lie thinks the learned authors have been looking in the wrong direction when searching Hebrew dictionaries for a derivation of this term, which he contends is a corruption of the word "gallery" or ''galery" from the low Latin Galeria, a long porch.

THE ambition of the citizens of '' The Ambitious City" as exemplified in the work of the City Improvement Society, is highly commendable and should serve as an example to other cities. As its name implies the society was organized to promote public improvements. Prizes were recently awarded by the society to citizens for the most attractive lawns and windows on Smith avenue, James street, North Napier and Pearl streets.

THE City Solicitor of Toronto reports that the fire by— law of that city compels the placing of tire escapes on factories, hotels, boarding and lodging houses, places of public amusement, and other public buildings over three stories high. The enforcement of the law devolves upon the City Commissioner. The City Solicitor states, however, that under the terms of the provincial laws, the enforcement of the by—law with respect to factories and hotels is taken out of the city's hands. The need of proper fires escapes is nowhere greater than in the case of hotels and factories. It is to be hoped therefore that the provincial inspectors are doing their work as it could he done by the city.

THE subject of heating and ventilation of churches has been under consideration of late in the pages of the religious and secular press, and as usual opinions differ. The Christian Observer says that every autumn there is need for a careful study of church heating and ventilation. The fear of the Observer is that owing to defectives pipes or chimneys it may get hot - —he consumed in fact. The Toronto Globe says :We know of churches, however, where the difficulty is that on cold Sundays there is not enough hot air comes up through the registers to keep the temperature much above freezing point. References on such occasions to another and a warmer world have no terrors for the preacher's shivering hearers.

THE expression "The Great Unwashed" has become a familiar one to designate the lowest strata of society in our large cities. It would seem that many respectable persons are in danger of being included in the category, simply because proper facilities for cleanliness

are denied to them. Recent inquiry has revealed the fact that out of 115 houses within a certain area in one thickly populated district, of Toronto, only five contain baths. No better proof is required of the need for public bathing facilities such as are provided by every town and city of England. Mr. W. J. Gage, an enterprising citizen, offered to build and equip a public bathing house if the city would provide a suitable site ; but the council were so lacking in appreciation that nothing was done. By the purchase of the Athletic Club buildings for a technical school, the city has recently come into possession of magnificent swimming baths, which under proper restrictions should be placed at the disposal of the thousands whose circumstances compel them to live in houses which not only have not '' all modern improvements

but lack that essential to cleanliness and health, a bath tub.

TORONTO archeologists will be interested in the description given by Mr. D. H. Every, of Pickering, of a mysterious stone or monument, situated on the east bank of Duffins' Creek in that township, about two miles south of the village of Pickering. The monument rises about eight feet above the level of the ground, and is about eight feet square. It was evidently built square, and is not a stone proper, but made up of a number of stones, cemented together with a cement resembling mortar. The stones are small, and just such stones as are to be picked up in the fields. The monument is covered with moss, and a large pine tree has grown on the upper part of it. This tree has been cut down, but the stump still remains. Within the memory of the oldest settler it is said there was a hole to be seen in the top of the monument filled with lead. This hole, however, cannot, be seen now, as it is overgrown with moss.

The Chinese have a god of architecture who is worshipped when a new house is built_ but he is ignored until the time comes for the builders to commence work. The Rev. W. Hopkyn Rees says, in the December issue of the Magazine of Art, that there is no society to safeguard the interests of architects in China, as professional architects do not exist ; each man settles his plan verbally with the builder. There is little fear of dissatisfaction, however, as no break in the '' style " has occurred for centuries. Comparatively few of the buildings have any architectural beauty. Kiln made bricks cost 10s a thousand, sun-dried bricks about 2S 6d a thousands while the windows of the houses are made of wooden gratings covered with oiled paper. Some of the pagodas (of which there must be at least two thousand in the empire) are elegant—like that, for example, in the Summer Palace at Pekin and It is remarkable how long they remain standing. There is one not far from Shanghai, 170 feet high, which was built in the twelfth century. The White Pagoda in Peking was built in 1100 A.D. But looked at by Western eyes Chinese architecture is a poor thing it is not comparable with the great Indian buildings.



Egg-shell gloss in paint work may be prepared by a number of' coats carefully rubbed down between each, and by using plenty of turps and a little oil in the last coats—not. sufficient, however, to render the job glossy, and yet enough to prevent it from drying entirely flat.
