THE Chief of the fire department in Montreal is urging the council of that city to pass an ordinance disallowing the practice of tilling hollow walls of buildings with sawdust. Sawdust appears to have been extensively used in this way by Montreal builders as a means of deadbing sound. Besides being deprived by more modern materials of any advantage it might once have possessed for this purpose, its combustible nature should alone be sufficient to preclude its use. The chief of the Montreal tire department is doubtless justified in asserting that many large conflagrations in that city have resulted from the employment of this material.



THE adaptability of women to the profession of architecture has been discussed from time to time of late in the professional journals. Probably as a result of this discussion prizes of $1,000, $500 and $250 respectively, were recently offered for the three best designs submitted for a <building>Woman's Building for the World's Fair</building>, the competition being restricted to female designers. As a result of this experiment a number of creditable designs have been received. The successful competitors in order of merit are: Miss Sophia G. Hayden, Boston, a graduate of the Massachusetts School of Technology, Miss Lois L. Howe, also of Boston, and Miss Laura Hayes, of Chicago. In the field of domestic architecture woman will in future be likely to find wide and profitable scope for her abilities.





WE print elsewhere a communication from Mr. <person>Victor Roy</person>, of Montreal, one of the judges in the late <building>Quebec City Hall </building>competition. We would be sorry to think that our comments in our March issue should be constituted as throwing any doubt on the competence of the judges in this instance. We were endeavoring to impress upon Canadian architects the tolly of entering competitions when proper conditions were lacking. The words "and competent judges appointed" were not intended as applicable to this specific case but to competitions in general. At the same time we hold it to be the duty of self-respecting architects who desire to see all competitions placed upon a fair basis, to refuse to act as referees unless the code be drawn up in accordance with the best practice of the day. The scrupulous observance of this point would rapidly educate the public, perhaps as quickly as the refusal of architects to enter competitions without proper code and satisfactory judges.



<building>THE Public School Board of Kingston</building> having decided to erect a new building, and being desirous that in it should be exhibited the most approved principles of design and equipment, appointed a committee of its members to visit the schools in Toronto, Hamilton, and elsewhere in quest of information. The committee on their return from a pleasant outing, announced that they were in a position to furnish the architect with such information as would "enable him to put up the building on the most modern principles." The question suggests itself, why was not the architect commissioned to obtain the necessary information? His knowledge of building would surely better qualify him to place a proper value upon what he should observe than a committee of persons despite of such knowledge. Apart from this important fact is the consideration that information obtained at second-hand is less distinct and more difficult application than when personally acquired. From an economical standpoint the interests of the taxpayer, which are professedly of paramount importance to the civic representative, would have been better
