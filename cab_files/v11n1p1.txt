THE proposition which has been made

	 The Proposed	establish a		square

	Victoria Square. to		public		opposite

the new municipal buildings, Toronto, has been referred to on several previous occasions. If the favorable conditions which at present exist for carrying out the scheme are allowed to pass, a golden opportunity of increasing the attractiveness of the city will have been forever lost. In the hope that the newly installed City Council may be induced to turn their attention to the project in a practical way, we publish a perspective view which in a measure serves to show the great improvement which would be effected by thus establishing a public square in the heart of the business portion of the city, and removing the unsightly structures which at present render it impossible to obtain a satisfactory view of the new City Buildings. We trust that the recently organized Guild of Civic Art, and all other persons interested in the attractiveness and welfare of the city, will unite in an endeavor to have this necessary improvement carried out.



IN presenting to our readers this New This Number. Year number, we desire gratefully to

acknowledge our indebtedness to the gentlemen who have given us valuable assistance in its preparation. These include Mr. T. R. Johnston, of New York, author of our cover design ; Mr. Keele, of the School of Practical Science ; Prof. Capper, of McGill University; Mr. G. A. Reid, R.C.A. of Toronto Mr. Fred. T. Hodgson, Collingwood ; Mr. Ormsby Graydon, City Engineer, London, Ont., and the various manufacturing and supply companies, for photographs from which the group of portraits in our illustrated pages is reproduced. It is a matter of regret to us, as it certainly will be to our readers, that our persuasive ability proved unequal to the task of securing photographs of two or three of the larger concerns, whose modesty is only equalled by their enterprise. The amount of space required for the report of the proceedings of the 0. A. A. convention has necessitated postponement of the publication of specially prepared and interesting articles designed for this number. For the same reason we are compelled to defer publication of the interesting papers submitted at the convention. We are pleased to be able to present brief biographical sketches and portraits of the executive officers of the newly organized Builders' Exchange of Montreal, and to be able to state that the new association is now in working order, and to all appearance is destined to be a potent factor in promoting the welfare of the building interests in the metropolitan city of Canada. Architects, builders, manufacturing and supply firms, and all who in any way are connected with the building interests, are congratulated on the promising outlook for the new year.
