<doctype type="text;ad">A very complete filling for open cracks in floors may be made by thoroughly soaking newspapers in paste made of one pound of ordinary flour, three quarts of water and about a table spoonful of alum; these ingredients to be thoroughly boiled and mixed, the final mixtures to be about as thick as putty, and it will then harden like papier mache, and may be used for moulds for various purposes.

A correspondent of the St. Croix Courier describes the new granite cutting factory of <firm>Epps, Dodds & Co</firm>. at St. George, N. B. This is 115 feet long and 70 feet wide; the main building 40 feet wide and 25 feet high. On each side are two wings running its entire length, and 15 and 19 feet wide respectively. A main line of shafting carries to all parts of the building power obtained from a 100 horse power water wheel. This is probably used for polishing, the north wing being occupied by stonecutters. Upwards of fifty hands are employed, and the company pays an average of $500 per week in wages. One-third of the trade of this firm is with the United States, nearly all the remainder with Ontario.
