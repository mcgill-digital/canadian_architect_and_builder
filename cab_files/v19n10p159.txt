" author="">COMPETITION FOR ADVERTISEMENT

DESIGNS.

We wish to make the advertisement pages of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER an artistic collection of attractive designs, each telling its own tale and irresistibly drawing the attention of readers to the articles advertised in an effective and artistic way.

With this object we invite competitive designs suitable for advertising the goods of any firm advertising in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER. Competitors may base their ideas on an advertisement already appearing, or they may put themselves in communication with an advertiser with a view to finding out what he would like to emphasize in his advertisement.

Competitors may send in one or more designs, and may exercise their own discretion as to the size of the same. Each, however, must be suitable for reproduction as either a full, half, or quarter-page of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER (the dimensions of which can be easily ascertained by a reference to advertisements at present appearing), and should be drawn 1 times the size.

Designs must be drawn with pen and perfectly black ink on white Bristol board, and must be sent in securely packed to prevent damage, with name and address of author written on the back.

To the author of the design which we consider the most suitable and the most artistic we shall award a prize of Ten Dollars, to that placed second Five Dollars, and to that placed third one years subscription to the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



The prize designs will become the property of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, with the right of making any arrangement with the advertiser with reference to publication of same.

The publishers reserve the right of purchasing any

designs sent in competition other than the prize ones at a price not exceeding $2 each.

The <firm>James Smart Manufacturing Co</firm>., of Brockville, Ont., have authorized us to announce that they will also give a prize of $10 for the best advertisement that may be submitted for the Kelsey Warm Air Generator. They will be prepared to send to any contestant such of their printed matter as may be desired. Contestants for this prize should make their drawings with pen and black ink on white card board.

All designs must be sent in on or before December 5th, 1906. Any arriving afterwards will be ineligible for the competition.
