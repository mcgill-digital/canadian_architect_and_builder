While there are some preparations for cleaning wall paper on the market, they are not always readily obtainable in every locality. The simplest way to clean wall or ceiling paper is to make bag of coarse flannel. in which tie or sew up two quarts of wheat bran, rubbing the same over the paper briskly, all in one direction taking care not to miss a single spot. Before beginning to rub, however, the walls or ceiling must be carefully dusted.
