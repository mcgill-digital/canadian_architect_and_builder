<doctype type="text">20	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	February, 1891



You will all understand that and it is distinctly requested and understood that we don't use initials, but the words in full.— "Member of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>."

<person>Mr. Henry: </person>Could a person be prosecuted for using the term "Member of the Ontario Association" instead of the term "Registered Architect," as called for by the Act?

The President I fancy if he was not a member he could be prosecuted under the common law of the land, without any reference to this Act at all.

Mr. Henry: The Act calls for a fine for using it.

<person>Mr. Edwards</person>, I think we should submit this matter to our legal adviser before taking any action.

THANKS.



<person>Mr. Gambier-Bousfield </person>moved, seconded by Mr. Langley, that a vote of thanks be tendered to the Minister of Education and the professors of the School of Practical Science for the use of the building during the. Convention, and that a copy of this resolution be forwarded to the Hon. <person>Mr. Ross</person>. Carried unanimously.

ELECTION OF COUNCILORS.



The President Now we will proceed to the election. I rule that each member must have a majority of the votes present, and if this number is not reached the ballot will be taken.

The Convention then adjourned.





THE BANQUET,



About seventy-five gentlemen sat down at Webb's restaurant, and after having partaken of a sumptuous repast— President <person>Storm</person> opened the proceedings by giving the toast of "The Queen," which was responded to by the company singing the National Anthem.

Canada—the Garden of the World," gave <person>Col. Fred C. Denison </person>occasion to say many good and loyal things about the country we all love, which the company received with enthusiasm.

Mr. <person>Kivas Tully</person>, in proposing Success and Prosperity to the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>," referred to the developments since 1844, when the only architects in Toronto were Mr. Lane, who built the present City Hall; <person>Mr. Howard</person>, the city engineer; <person>Mr. Young</person>, who built the east wing of the University; and <person>Mr. Thomas</person>. He congratulated the Association on its growth. For himself, he bad completed his half century as an active architect and civil engineer. (Applause). He had spent thirty-four years in the Government service here, and during the last twelve months had certified accounts for public buildings and repairs equal to $600,000; and since entering the public service his certificates had averaged about $450,000 a year. (Applause). it was no sinecure to look after all that. He was pleased to see the beautiful buildings that are put up in Toronto from year to year. Some of them he had handled himself, but they had gone beyond him in many respects. Style has materially altered he preferred the old classical style to the neo-Greek. as you call it—(Laughter)—or your Queen Anne style. (A voice—' Waite' ). (Renewed laughter).

<person>Mr. Rastrick </person>responded on behalf of the older members.  The Association would do honor to the craft and to every one belonging to it. He was pleased that a by-law had been passed which would prevent architects from trafficking their integrity and their honor against their clients, by dealing with manufacturers on commission. (Hear, hear). Every man should stand up for the honor of his craft. We have to make our position felt by the different professions. We are gentlemen of descent—and I am an Englishman, and a Yorkshireman at that. (Laughter). Yorkshire has given men that gave us the Bible to read at our leisure. You can trace almost all the laws that have improved our Magna Charta from Yorkshire. (Laughter). I am sorry to allude to it, but it is a fact that we can't deny—it has given us such sons as I am. (Great laughter). I love my profession as I love my mother. Our craft has been honored for ages past. For thousands of years an architect was always held in the highest esteem. In history, architecture is spoken of in the most glorious and honorable manner. I hope to see my brother architects in all the leading positions—not politics, because I have found they can't be politicians without being liars. (Boisterous laughter). Keep clear of politics, and you will have more sound, practical thoughts by which to carry on your profession. (Applause).

<person>Mr. Curry </person>on behalf of the younger men, trusted that Mr. Tully would be spared to practice many years yet. Many of us would like to have our time occupied to the same extent that his is—(Laughter)—and get five per cent. for the work. The progress of our Association has been greater than any of us expected last year; we had not much hope of obtaining the Act, but we secured it very shortly after our last annual meeting. Though it Is not just what we would like it to be, still it is a basis on which to work, and in the course of a few years we will have all that is necessary. (Applause).

Mr. <person>Edmund Burke</person>, in proposing the toast of the Civil Engineers," coupled with the names of Messrs. <firm>Macdougall and Jennings</firm>, said the times had changed. Architects were paying more attention to the strength of their buildings, while engineers were giving more thought to beauty in design <person>Allan</person> in

<person>Mr. Macdougall</person>, responding, said the engineers had led the way by obtaining an act of incorporation, but the architects had gone farther, and had by their Act become the first governing body, who will shortly say who are to be members of the profession. The schools in Ontario, and also in Montreal are doing an immense amount of very valuable work in training the younger men and from what we saw to-day in the School of Science, I am sure that the architectural branch there is going to hold its own and make its mark in a very prominent way upon the future young men of your profession. Permit me to point out one small matter which your Council might consider, In the <building>Public Library </building>here there is a very large and valuable collection of books on architecture, decoration, and

every art: but they are not in a position to be consulted by those who would derive the greatest benefit from them. A grant of $30,000 has been put in the city estimates for this year, and the first time the bonds of the city are sold, provision is to be made for this sum for the erection of a building to be used for reference library purposes. Now, gentlemen, you are all working in the lines of art art is really the foundation of the architect's profession. We have here a number of young men and manufacturers, who are doing beautiful work, modeling and improving the architectural taste. You as a body have taken a very proper step in throwing your patronage over your <assoc>Architectural Sketch Club</assoc>; and I think you might use your influence as a body to get the City Council to carry out at once the idea of a reference library with proper appliances, where any man can go— engineers as well as architects, modellers, designers, and students of the schools of art—and be able to study quietly, as they do in the large libraries in England, works which are of great value to them. (Applause).

<person>Mr. Jennings </person>(City Engineer): I congratulate the members of the Association on their advancement, and trust it will continue till the organization shall become second to none. As city engineer, I hope to have more intimate acquaintance with you, inasmuch as it is my desire to establish an architectural branch in connection with my department—not to interfere with your legitimate professional operations, but to assist you, and protect you against men who are building without the supervision of architects or men trained to thoroughly understand what is intended and desired. (Applause), I hope this will be an assistance to you, and that you will look upon it in that light, and assist in furthering this object. Now, if you will allow me, I will mention what, as a city, we require—a public building of such magnitude and design as would be in keeping with Toronto as it is now, and as it is likely to be hereafter. (Hear, hear). We have not a hall in this city fit for any public purpose of an extensive character, either political or social. Could you not use your influence to get the city to go into something beautiful——something that would be characteristic of the place as well as useful? It does not necessarily follow that such a building should pay a dividend on its cost. We must look beyond that, as a city; we must have something ornamental; and I mention this, as it is of the very greatest necessity, in my opinion, that at a very near date such a structure should be erected. (Applause).

<person>Mr. Curry </person>proposed the toast, The School of Architecture and Engineering, coupled with the names of <person>Profs. Galbraith </person>and <person>Wright</person>, and in doing so said The training there received by students is essential as a ground work for practical work in an architect's office. The school is now only in its infancy, but it will be an easy matter to make it equal to any in America.

<person>Prof. Galbraith </person>said he was doing everything possible to bring the school into close connection with the architects, because he felt if the school did not do its work on lines they approved of, it would be a failure. The true view of education is to have the young mans work so arranged that he sees the relation of the different parts and gets a certain amount of training in the elements of his profession It is impossible to turn out full-fledged architects from a school, because the important factor of the sense of responsibility is absent. Practical problems are presented to the student, and he has to analyze them and put his knowledge together as best he can and get out the results—that is to say, of the same kind that a man should try to obtain in practice. The idea should rather be to find out principles, and use practical experiments of all kinds for the sake of determining principles. Under the old system those principles were simply stated by the teacher or read from a book, and the student got a very dim idea of them. School work is analytic; practical work is constructive. The professional architect has not time to make experiments to find out, say, whether wood or iron or stone will stand a certain stress. He has to get results from somewhere. Now, in a school, all experiments of that nature should be made. A man trained in this way is not a practical man; but when be goes into an office he has got a good start. We must depend upon his practical education in the office, and on work afterwards, for his becoming a successful professional man. I listened with a great deal of pleasure to Mr. <person>Gambier-Bousfield</person>paper on "Education"; and I think there is great hope for a profession when it takes an interest in the education of the younger members. (Applause). It is certainly unselfish as far as you are concerned; and yet, after all, it is the true sort of selfishness. You may depend upon it that if young men get proper chances for scientific and artistic education they will do more to put the profession in a proper position before the world than anything else. Up till now that was not necessary; but competition is keener, cities are larger, and a greater number of professional men must be employed. If young men have not the chance of being trained systematically the profession must go down. Men in all professions desire technical education. In spite of all that is said about the unpracticalness of young men turned out of these schools, yet they are preferred, I think, by professional men to those who have had no previous education —(Hear, hear). I have been assured that it is quite possible for a great number of architectural students who are engaged in offices to attend lectures in the School of Science in the mornings. We try to hold most of our lectures in the mornings, and devote the afternoon to practical work. I was asked by Hon. <person>Mr. Ross</person>, the Minister of Education, if it was not possible to do something to aid the students in the offices. Now, we are quite prepared to take all students who like to come up between nine and one o'clock. All the purely architectural lectures, on the History of Architecture and Ornament Decoration, and so on, take place between those hours, as also some lectures on Construction; and I should be very happy if the students could arrange to leave the offices and take those lectures. It would not take, perhaps, more than an hour some days, and two horns at the most on other days, to attend this work. The regulations of the School are such as to admit of special students—students not taking the whole course. (Hear, hear, and applause).

Prof. Wright expressed thanks on behalf of his students for the benefit derived from the Convention. He trusted that next year the school would be able to offer special attractions to members of the Association, He trusted the collection of photographs would be of benefit and interest not only to the School, but to all members of the profession, and that they would call frequently. Before next October all the testing machines would be in working order, and these would be of great interest to the profession. He hoped his work might be done in harmony with theirs. (Applause).

<person>Mr. Paull</person>. in proposing the '<assoc>Royal Canadian Academy</assoc>," coupled with the name of Mr. Smith, paid an eloquent tribute to the progress of art.

<person>Mr. Smith</person>, R. A., said: The Royal Canadian Academy, since its organization in 1880, has made its mark on Canadian life. Thirteen exhibitions have been held—one in each city in the Dominion. Last year pictures were donated to the National Gallery at Ottawa, to the amount of $1,000 Canadian artists are making their mark in the old lands, and it will not be long before Canada will have a history in art equal to that of any other country—age considered. (Applause ).

Mr. Gambier-Bousfield, in proposing the toast of the Younger Members,' said the members of the Architectural Sketch Club were doing work that could not be compassed in architects' offices, and we are all glad to recognize that organization which is doing so much good in bringing the young men forward in their profession.
