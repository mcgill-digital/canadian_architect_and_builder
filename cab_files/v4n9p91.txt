benefited the Association but also the public at large. The public in Ontario feel it. The public feel that when they take an architect belonging to the Association, they have an architect possessed of the ability requisite for the proper carrying out of the work which he undertakes. Gentlemen, I drink this toast with the greatest pleasure, and I know that you do likewise.

<person>Mr. Doran </person>was called upon to respond to this toast, and said:

Mr., President and Gentlemen, I suppose I must for the moment imagine that I am a foreigner at least foreign to this province. I must at the outset express my regret that there is no genuine native born Ontario man here to speak for them, but I suppose ( must become naturalized and for the time being consider myself as an Ontario member. When I was first asked to respond to this toast the question arose why I should be selected, instead of any other member of the Association, to denationalize myself from the Province of Quebec and become, for the time being, the representative of the sister Association of the Province of Ontario, and that question I have not been able to solve. Well, to proceed, on the part of the <assoc>Ontario Association </assoc>I return the most sincere thanks for the manner in which this toast has been received ; and as art really knows no nationality, much more it may be said that art in Canada, particularly that of architecture, should know no nationality, that it should be one broad Canadian work. We hope the time is not far distant when it will be the <assoc>Association of Architects of the Dominion of Canada </assoc>(Applause), and when the Provincial Associations will be small branches (the same as to-day we have the local branches of <assoc>Montreal and Quebec of the Provincial Association</assoc>) of that greater <assoc>Association of the Dominion</assoc>. In this manner the prosperity and growth of the Dominion may be advanced, because there is no surer way, no more eloquent way, of telling in the most silent manner possible of the greatness of a country than by pointing to its architectural monuments. When the songs of the poet will be forgotten, the monuments of stone raised by a people shall pass down to future ages and testify to time grandeur and greatness of their country, as do those majestic monuments of ancient Greece to-day. The magnitude of examples of architecture should testify to the greatness of our country, and the stamp of originality which we hope will be placed on our buildings, and which we hope our Association will tend to foster, may prove that Canada is a nation, that it is a country fair and free, a country of which we may' all be proud. (Applause.) It is to be hoped, gentlemen, that the Association of tile broad Dominion will soon take the place of the Provincial Associations, and carry onward and forward the good work which has been begun by' the Provincial Associations. <person>Mr. Hutchison </person>spoke of us as building the foundations. Let us hope then that tile foundations which we are building may be the foundations of a vast arch which will spring over all this country, and time not in bands of iron but in bands of stone, if I may use the expression, the whole country. (Applause.) Gentlemen, I think I cannot do better before resuming my seat, than to propose the toast of "Canada, Our Country," the country of which we may justly feel proud and I will call upon our friend <person>Mr. Baillargé </person>to respond to this toast in the fitting terms which he so well knows how to use.

Mr. Baillairgé responded briefly' to this toast, saying :—I must say that you have made a very poor selection in calling upon me to respond to this toast. Of course we are all proud of Canada, though it would appear just now that our American cousins are doubtful of the propriety of annexing us, for fear they' should be led into bad ways. I am glad to see that in our by-laws we have taken good care to exclude all kinds of bolding, still it is so difficult to make a dollar, that perhaps you would like to know the way the miller advised his sons to manage when they' could not make a dollar honestly, and with your permission I will give you "The Miller"

Mr. Baillargé then entertained tile banqueters with the rendering of a humorous song entitled "The Miller."

The toast of the "Press" was proposed by <person>Mr. Clift </person>in a few well chosen words, and responded to by Mr. <person>J. B. Mortimer</person>, who was followed by Mr. Haynes.

The toast to the retiring President, Mr. Hopkins, proposed by' <person>Mr. Roy</person>, was received enthusiastically, all joining in the chorus, " For he's a Jolly' Good Fellow."

<person>Mr. Hopkins</person>, responding, said : Mr. President and Gentlemen : - I thought you would have got pretty near tired of hearing my speeches, which amount to noise and nothing else. My old friend Mr. Roy, I know, spoke feelingly in proposing my health, because we have been friends for many years ; and I assure you that I feel very grateful and very much indebted to you all for the manner in which you have accepted this toast. I hope that at any time that my assistance can be of the slightest value you will not fail to call upon me. You have almost overpowered me with the enthusiasm of your demonstration and I can only hope that those who succeed me will obtain I know they will merit it the same kind expression of feeling which you have shown towards me.

The toast of "The Retiring Council," proposed by' <person>Mr. Larochelle</person>, was responded to by <person>Mr. Piché</person>, who said

Mr. President,— Mr. Larochelle has proposed time health of time Council which guided the affairs of our Association during the past year. I must say' that I have not participated in the carrying out of their work as much as I should like to have done. I cannot but say that the work which has been done,

particularly in Montreal, merits high praise; and if the Association stands on a sure and solid tooting to-day, it is owing in large part to the gentlemen belonging to Montreal. We have started out well, and let us continue to go forward with a firm step, confident that we are doing good conscientious work, which will have its effect not only among ourselves but also among the public, who well know how to appreciate it. (Applause.)

<person>Mr. Ouellet </person>followed with a few brief remarks expressive of his gratification at the thorough appreciation by the members in general of the efforts put forth by the Council of last year for time advancement of the interests of the Association.

<person>Mr. Clift </person>called for a toast to the newly elected President, <person>Mr. Berlinqtiet</person>, saying that he felt confident that Mr. Berlinquet would be an honor and an ornament to the Association, and would do) full justice to the position which he was called upon to fill.

<person>Mr. Berlinquet</person>, replying, said that it was but right and fitting to compliment those who had acquitted themselves of their duties in a praiseworthy' manner ; but it was rather premature to bestow praise upon one whose work was not really commenced. He assured the Association that he would do his utmost, and was prepared to make any sacrifice, to fulfill the duties which should devolve upon him in the onerous position to which they had raised him.

The health of "The Ladies" was then drank with gusto, and <person>Mr. Gauthier </person>answered for them in a most happy manner.

In the course of time evening the banquetters were entertained by the rendering of several fine songs by Messrs. <person>Gendron</person>, <person>Roy</person> and <person>Pageau</person>.

The newly elected Council held its first meeting at the <building>Florence Hotel </building>on the 12th inst., and after having disposed of some routine business, accepted(l time invitation of the President, Mr. Berlinquet, and <person>Mr. Peachy</person>, to enjoy a drive about the city.
