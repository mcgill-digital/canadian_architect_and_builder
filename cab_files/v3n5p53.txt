This effort on the part of building committees to cut down fees of architects results in the erection of unstudied designs. The architect gives as little as he can for the little that he is offered, and thus gets even with his employers. The architect who takes a pride in doing his work as thoroughly as he can, and who devotes much time to the study of it in all its details, cannot compete with the man who is content to impose upon the community his first conception in an exceedingly crude form. Plans of the cheap architect are very much like store clothes, they may be showy and cheap, but they are not such as will result in a substantial or artistic building. Designs which are turned out like boots and shoes out of a shoe factory, are dear at any money. This difference would be more discernible if it were not that some architects of reputation, while they charge full fees, do not give value in return, but slur their work in a most disgraceful manner. These men are not working because of any love of their profession, but because they must earn a living, and the sooner they can make a competency the better, even though they do not give a fair equivalent. Generally speaking, this species of the architect gains the good opinion of the multitude, because it is money with him first and last, and he cares not what he does so long as he meets with the approval of his clients, be they ever so wanting in a knowledge of the aesthetic. He is prepared to work in all their whims, even though his reputation, such as it is, may suffer. A client should employ an architect not because he will approve of his client's notions, but because he knows his business, and insists on working honestly for his client's benefit even though pet ideas must be overlooked.





T

HE attention of the Dominion Government is called to the fact that the proper amount of duty, based upon the cost of the buildings, as provided for by the tariff, has not been collected upon the plans of American architects entering Canada. From a seemingly reliable source we are informed that not one dollar has been paid at the port of Toronto in the shape of duties on <person>Mr. Waite</person>'s plans for the <building>Parliament Buildings </building>or the <building>Canada Life Assurance Company's building</building>, while in the case of the <building>Canadian Bank of Commerce </building>building duty was paid on an estimated cost of about $60,000, while the actual cost cannot have been less than four or five times that amount. It would appear as though Mr. Waite might claim among his other accomplishments as an " expert" that of being an expert smuggler. Plans for the Toronto Board of Trade building paid duty on an estimated cost of $200,000, which sum, however, will be largely exceeded. The Government should take steps to secure to Canadian architects the protection which the tariff was designed to afford them, and to the country the revenue of which it has been and is being defrauded. The authors of the plans for the buildings we have mentioned are well known, the approximate cost of the buildings can be determined, and if the plans have not paid duty they should be compelled to do so now.





A

 CORRESPONDENT of the Toronto Globe who mis-appropriately styles himself "Canadian," attempts a defence of Mr. Waite and the Ontario Government with respect to the erection of the new Parliament Buildings. Did our space permit, we might easily show the weakness of this effort to defend conduct that is simply indefensible. We content ourselves with repudiating the statement made by this writer that "if Toronto architects would do better work, we should not need to go elsewhere." The writer asks how many brick walls have lately tumbled about our ears? We have directed attention to one in another column, but singularly enough the architects are Americans, not Canadians, It is reported that owing to the condition of affairs on the new <building>Toronto Board of Trade buildings</building>, the American architects in question have been dismissed and the completion of the work placed in the hands of a <person>Mr. Kent</person>, a Buffalo architect, and a cousin of <person>Mr. Wellington</person>, one of the experts appointed on behalf of the Board of Trade to report as to the condition of the building. It is further reported that it will cost the Board of Trade upwards of $50,000 to make good the defects in construction. No such loss has yet resulted from the employment of a Canadian architect, and we are justified in saying that the proportion of competent men in the profession in Canada is equal to that to be found in the United States or elsewhere. Competency and incompetency are to be found in any country. The man who insinuates, as does "Canadian" that Canadian architects are all incompetent, while American architects are all competent, may be written down either a fool or a knave.

O

N April the 5th, a circular was issued calling for a meeting of the Montreal architects. the present time being thought opportune to form an Association. Some twenty-five members attended, and after a general discussion the following resolution was moved by Mr. <person>M. Perrault</person>, seconded by <person>S. Lesage</person>

"That Messrs. <person>Nelson</person>, <person>Hopkins, </person><person>Taylor</person>, <person>Hutchinson</person>, <person>Raza</person>, <person>Doran</person>, <person>Hodson, </person><person>Dunlop</person> and <person>Resther</person>, Sen., with <person>C. Clift </person>as Secretary, be a Committee to organize, and that they be instructed to communicate with the other architects in the province, and obtain their views and co-operation. The above Committee to report at a meeting to be called by the Secretary."

Owing to the severe illness of Mr. Clift, no meeting of the Committee was called until may the 8th, his duties being temporarily filled by another member of the profession.

The Committee are now framing a Constitution and By-laws to submit to a general meeting which it is hoped will be called at an early date.

It is a pleasure to learn that a strong feeling prevails among the architects of the Province of Quebec in favor of a Provincial Association.

THREE DESIGNS FOR FRONT FENCE.



 Brownie" and "Arm and Hammer" are nearly equal in excellence in their ironwork, but the wooden fence of "Arm and Hammer is not good. It is a poor kind of commonplace in design, and not rightly applied to external woodwork.

"Brownie's" wrought ironwork is both more graceful than that of " Arm and Hammer," and the design is better adapted to the material. For these reasons we have considered Brownie" to deserve the first place.

Competitor," who contributes the only other set of designs, shines chiefly in rendering. His pen and ink work is perhaps better than that of the two first, but his designing is not well considered.

<article title="Toronto Architectural Sketch Club" author=""><assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.

T

HE paper read by Mr. <person>Edmund Burke </person>before this Club on

Tuesday, April 22nd, will be found in full in this number. After the conclusion and after a hearty vote of thanks had been tendered the lecturer of the paper, the decision of the club competition for "A Summer Cottage" was announced as follows:

Senior Section—First place, <person>Ernest Wilby</person>; Second place<person>, A. H. Gregg </person>; Third place, <person>J. A. Radford</person>. Junior Section—First place, <person>J. Y. S. Russell</person>.

The subject for the next competition was suggested by <person>Mr. Darling</person>, and will be the details for a large window 9 x 12 feet opening. The intention is to encourage a more thorough study of the architectural style and it should be productive of good results.

On Tuesday, May 13th, an address was delivered by Mr. <person>W. A. Sherwood</person>, 0. 5. A., on "Color in Nature and its Place in Architecture." Mr. Sherwood has made a special study of this subject, and many practical suggestions were thrown out. He pointed to Nature as the great master of color, and explained why all our color schemes should receive their motive from Nature's works.

Black and white, the prevailing colors in modern use, had most disastrous effects on the eye. In school rooms, for instance, no white plaster should be seen. The blackboards should be green with cherry mouldings and a brown border around. The furniture, and also the clothing of both teachers and scholars, should be of pleasing colors. Green, Nature's favorite color, should be largely used in decoration, its restful effect to the eye being well known. Motives could be found in Nature for every phase of architectural needs and necessities— the sky, the sunsets, the foliage of the trees, etc., each could give innumerable examples of what could be done.

Several members, including Messrs. Bousfield, <person>Williams</person>, <person>Burke</person> and <person>Jones</person>, spoke on the subject after Mr. Sherwood took his seat. Mr. Bousfield referred at length to the past use of color by architects of different ages and countries. Mr. <person>J. P. Murray </person>put a very practical conclusion to the proceedings by offering a prize to the members for the best scheme for decorating the walls of the Club room, the glaring whiteness of which had been referred to as sad examples of what should not be seen.

The vote of thanks then closed the evenings proceedings.
