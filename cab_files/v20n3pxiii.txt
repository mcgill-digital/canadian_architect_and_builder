The "Faber System"

of Fireproof Flooring





The above system of Fireproof Hollow Tile Floor Slab without beams is used for every span in buildings of all kinds.



It is a very cheap fireproof floor because it is the most simple and labor and material saving, is the lightest and thinnest and as sound proof as any on the market.



These qualities are accomplished by distributing the material to meet existing stresses according to experience and science. The cross reinforcement allows a good and reliable anchorage for supporting walls. This slab also rests on supporting walls uniformly and considering the fact that it is comparatively thin, a good deal is saved in the height of the building. The cross reinforcements prevent cracks, and plaster adheres well to the terra cotta blocks used in the construction.



This is a system of great renown, being used in the new Palace of the German Emperor at Posen and most of the schools, hospitals and prominent buildings in Germany and is being extensively favored in the United States.
