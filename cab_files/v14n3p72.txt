<doctype type="text;ad">72	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



The ruinous competition which has long prevailed between the cement manufacturers in Southern Germany and those of Switzerland, is likely to be brought to a close by a proposed agreement between the Swiss Syndicate and South German Cement Manufacturing Syndicates by which the former will cease to complete

for German trade and the latter will no longer export to Switzerland.



Mr. W. T. Dalton, a well known British Columbia architect, has recently returned from a three months visit to England, New York and Boston.
