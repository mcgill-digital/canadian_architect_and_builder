THE next convention of the American Institute of Architects will be held at Buffalo, during the Pan-American Exhibition. The choice of a meeting place seems a wise one, for outside of its own attractiveness, the city of Buffalo will have a wealth of' architectural features to show in its Exhibition.



THE Club are to be congratulated upon the success of' the exhibition of architectural drawings held under their

management in Toronto last month, an extended notice of which appears in another part of this issue. Several months of' earnest effort were required to perfect the arrangements for this exhibition. The expenses were met by the revenue derived from advertisements in the exhibition catalogue, the compilation and publication of which also involved much labor. The number of visitors to the exhibition was large and would no doubt have been greater but for the death of the Queen. The public lecture by Mr. Albert Kelsey, of' Philadelphia, on methods of beautifying towns and cities, brought together a good audience, and was much appreciated.

The exhibition has undoubtedly proved a stimulus to local architects and directed public attention to the subject of' architecture—results which in themselves are important.

THE recent great fire in Montreal and the consequent heavy increase in insurance rates, should not only lead to

the perfecting of' fire brigades and equipment, but, on the principle that prevention is better than cure, should direct public attention to the value of fire resisting materials in building construction. The Japanese Government has recognized the wisdom of such action, by giving an order to a United States manufacturer for 8o,ooo feet of wire glass to be used as a fire-resistant in the Imperial Japanese navy buildings at Mai Juru The value of' properly constructed division walls as a means of' preventing the spread of fire within a building was well illustrated at the recent fire in the store of Marshall Field & Co., in Chicago, where by such walls the fire was confined to one section and the loss was only

$25,000.





THERE has recently come to hand a report of a test conducted last year by the British Fire Prevention Committee

with fire-resisting curtains and blinds. The object of the test was to show the protection against fire afforded to a window and to a door of 20 superficial feet and 16 superficial feet area respectively, when screened from
