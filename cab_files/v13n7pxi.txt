The blame in this instance rests with the British authorities, as both the architect and contractor were appointed by the colonial committee. It is much to be regretted that a competition for designs among Canadian architects was not instituted, in order that the building might typify the development achieved by Canada in architecture.

The city solicitor of Ottawa has advised the council that they have exceeded their powers in connection with the new plumbing by-law recently adopted. He states that the municipal act only confers the power to prevent unqualified persons from undertaking plumbing work hut does not empower the council to pass bylaws regulating the construction of buildings or to require the licensing of drain layers. It is in the last mentioned particulars that the Ottawa by- law is declared to be ultra vires.
