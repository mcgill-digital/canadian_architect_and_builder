The corrosion which lakes place on the bottom of iron railings set in stonework with melted lead is, according to Professor J. M. Thomson, largely due to galvanic action, and the same action will exercise its influence in all cases where two different metals come in contact, unless that contact be as perfect as possible. But the action of acid vapors which are in the atmosphere of some towns on iron and zinc is considerable, especially when the metals are in

the form of thin or perforated sheets and gauze. Professor Thomson observed the action of the air of Glasgow on a window blind of fine iron wire gauze during a period of about seven years. Although originally protected with lacquer, the lower portion of the blind in position opposite to where the window had been daily raised from its sash had been gradually eaten away. There is no doubt that such corrosive actions are assisted by the simultaneous process of oxidation, hut there is, at the same time, evidence of the direct action of the acid vapors. The principal conditions tinder which lead fails are when it comes in contact with air, moisture and carbonic acid, more especially if organic acids derived from the soil or other sources arc also present. In this case rapid corrosion may he expected, the action being similar to that already mentioned in the formation of the basic carbonate or white lead. This action being continuous in the presence of the chemical substances mentioned, the lead becomes finally entirely converted. The rusting of grey cast—iron is apparently slower than that of wrought iron, the different varieties corroding more quickly as the amount of carbon increases in the iron. A cement known under the name of rust—joint cement is employed in the junction of iron pipes. It is composed of 80 parts tine iron filings, 1 part of ammonium chloride, and 2 parts of sulphur made into a paste with water. When this is packed into the joint it sets into a hard cement, apparently produced by the formation of mixed oxide and sulphide of iron.
