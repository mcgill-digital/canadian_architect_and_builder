Dear Sir: I have examined the Maguire trap with great interest, and I am convinced that it combines, in a simple and complete manner all the true principles of a perfectly ventilated water-seal, and will take the greatest pleasure in recommending it to every one.

Respectfully,

A full line of all the BEST and MOST POPULAR



CLOSETS, BASINS, etc.



 WE have selected this pattern as being one

of the best of the Syphon Closets now in

use. It is simple, quiet and effective in action, and has four to five inches seal of water in the bowl. The Jet, besides the Syphon, acts upon the water in the bowl, facilitating the outgo, so that a limited quantity of water is required for each operation. We make it in white and ivory ware, plain or embossed, and decorated in colors, if desired. Â·We make these Closets entirely in one piece and in one mould, so that there are no seams, as by the ordinary method of manufacture, thus preventing any risk o flaws or leaks from imperfect joints. The very best imported materials are used, and the Closets will not craze or discolor.
