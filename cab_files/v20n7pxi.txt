iridescent as the result of corrosion. On the extraction of the alkali by water this lime is left behind with the silica, and forms with it a hard, insoluble silicate of lime, which adheres to the corroded surface of the glass, forming an opaque scum or patina. In some cases this is so marked that the glass appears to be covered with a coat of cement.

"The peculiar Pitting of old stained glass is not, however, in the author's opinion, due to corrosion at all, but to a change in the constitution of the glass. As is well known, glass changes its constitution and becomes crystalline if kept at a red heat for a length of time. What happens in a few hours when the glass is hot tends to take place on prolonged exposure to the atmosphere, with this difference: that when the glass is molten its molecules can freely move about, whereas when it is cold and rigid such freedom of movement is impossible; in consequence the definite formation of crystals can not take place, and the result of the change is different. What happens is this: In the first place molecules of the same kind tend to separate out from the homogeneous mixture and collect round a point forming a centre of decor

position. Proceeding from this centre the glass is found decomposing into definite compounds in an ever-enlarging circle until it reaches a point at which the strain set up in the glass by this molecular movement results in a crack forming round the area of decomposition, and then the whole mass comes away, leaving behind it a little hole or pit in the surface of the glass.
