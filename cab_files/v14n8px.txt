PROPOSED PUBLIC LIBRARY FOR MONTREAL.



Considerable comment has been aroused by the action of the Mayor of Montreal in making a request to Mr. Andrew Carnegie for money with which to erect a Public Library in that city. In response to the request, Mr. Carnegie has offered to give $150,000 for the erection of a building on condition that the city shall provide a site and expend $15,000 per year for maintenance. The consensus of opinion in Ontario at least appears to he that it is not becoming to the dignity of a wealthy community like Montreal to ask outside assistance towards carrying out a public undertaking of this kind. If Montreal feels its need of a Public Library its citizens are abundantly able to supply the necessary unds for its erection, and by doing so they would better main— am the self—respect and dignity of the chief commercial city of Canada.
