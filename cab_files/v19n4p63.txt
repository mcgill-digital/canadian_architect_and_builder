<doctype type="text;ad">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	63



Among the plans submitted, and which appealed to thc writer, were those entered under the nom de plume of Victoria, Winterott, Ormande, Craftsman, and Arenco.

The cost of producing the drawings in this case are considerable; twenty-six at the first call and sixteen at the second; forty-two plans at an average cost of $100 is not too high a price to assume, thus the architects have wasted $4,500 without the slightest assurance of even

square deal.

The object of a competition should be to secure the most skilled architect, as shown by the scheme which he presents.

An architectural adviser should draw up the programme and advise the owner in relation to technical questions in making the programme, selecting the scheme and the architect.

The amount to be expended on the work should be sufficient, within a reasonable margin, to erect a structure of the character and size indicated in thc programme, or there should be no cost stipulated.

The programme should be in the nature of a contract, which guarantees the employment of the successful competitor to make the drawings for and supervise the work of the proposed structure at a proper remuneration.

Payment sufficient to cover the preparation of the drawings demanded of competitors in limited competitions, and prizes or premiums in open competitions, to cover such expense for at least the five best schemes should he guaranteed.

Sincerely yours,

<person>W.	W. LACHANCE</person>, Architect.
