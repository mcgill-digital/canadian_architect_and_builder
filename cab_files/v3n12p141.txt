The following letter speaks for itself:

Office of W. A Freeman,

HAMILTON, ONT., Nov. 5th, 1890. <firm>ADAMANT MFG. CO</firm>., Toronto, Ont.

GENTLEMEN—I have much pleasure in giving my views of the Adamant Wall Plaster, which I used lately in my office and show room. It is far superior to the ordinary lime and sand mortar that has been formerly used.

1st. That the building can be plastered and completed without the men leaving the job on account of drying

2nd. The carpenters can go in next day and finish their work as they did in this case.

3rd. On account of its strength to adhere to any substance. My ceiling is a long span; put machinery on floor over ceiling three days after it was put on, which jars the whole building. It has been running now for some time, and up to the present there is no appearance of cracks or imperfection whatever—in fact, I would not have the old style mortar put on my building it it was put on for nothing

Yours truly,

<person>W.	A. FREEMAN</person>.
