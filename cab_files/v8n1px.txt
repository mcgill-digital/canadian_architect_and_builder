"LILY"

"Richelieu"

Registered No. 20/4741.



 IN consequence of the great popularity of this Closet, we find  that imitations are being made and sold as the Richelieu, though decidedly inferior to the genuine article.

The "Richelieu" Closets made by us are stamped as above, in addition to our "Trade Mark," and as the name "Richelieu' is registered in the Department of Agriculture, we shall take immediate action against any one stamping the name "Richelieu" on any closet, or having in possession closets so stamped that are not of our manufacture.
