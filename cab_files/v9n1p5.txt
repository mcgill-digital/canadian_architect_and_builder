a	balance where extras and deductions are concerned. Some final books contain under credit column a complete list, month and dates of progress payments, but if the contractor's ledger is regularly posted it is unnecessary to repeat that work for owner's benefit.

ORDER BOOK FOR EXTRA WORK.



When extra work is desired by client or his architect, a price arranged and an order given beforehand will lessen the time spent on the final adjustment of account.



CONTRACTORS LEDGER.



The Ledger consists of a 3 money column or bank ruled book. The top of page gives name of client, kind of building, street, location, in city or town. Across

DIARY.



This book may be had from any stationer, and ruled by hand to suit.

The first column denotes the hour or time occupied, next the name of client or building, remarks, ledger folio and money columns. The lower half of page may be used to keep draughtsman's time on special work. The time spent on each drawing is placed under the remarks column. The dollars and cents columns can be used for entering the cost of the drawing, or they may serve for noting expenses of every description, such as car fares, travelling expenses, etc., incurred while superintending buildings or other work.

As extensive and complicated work usually requires more time than at first estimated upon and extra work frequently is added, disputes with clients relating to

the page the name of the contractor is inserted, with sufficient space allowed between it and the next amount to admit the placing of amounts of his account, and so on with all parties engaged on the works.

It can be readily seen that in closing a building account the architect has a complete list, avoiding the tedious task of searching through the counterfoils of a score or more certificates, occasionally missing some account from final statement the commission on which, overlooked on each job during the year, might involve a considerable loss to an architect's bank account.



A second class of ledger is ruled and printed for noting in a condensed form the entire contracts relating to a job or structure. One column contains all of the information relating to the masons, another to the carpenter, etc. Payments made are quickly entered on the lower half of the page. It is unnecessary to refer to the contract or to the certificate book for information. If carefully kept, this book will save much valuable time, both for immediate and future reference.

charges for time spent on their orders can be satisfactorily adjusted. The record always speaks for itself, and if necessary the men who were engaged on the work can be called to verify their figures and time.

Very little time is wasted by an employee in making the entry, as nothing need be written but the description or number of work and the number of hours spent thereon.

The diary may also be used to mark the general business in, and posted into a ledger.

At the top of page are written name of owner, class of building and location. When drawings are taken out of the office a receipt taken at the time of delivery will greatly assist in bringing them back, and a history of the case may be obtained without delay or inconvenience.

SPECIFICATION COVER.

A neat form of keeping specifications clean and easily handled is by using the " Lawyer Brief Covers." The marginal references would then be made in the centre of the paper between each paragraph.
