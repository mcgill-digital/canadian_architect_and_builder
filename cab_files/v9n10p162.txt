ends, to guard against the possible effect of winds BUILDER extraordinary violence.

The lower chords of the flanking spans of the cantilever bridge, and of the longer spans of the south approach, are curved down to the stone piers of the substructure, both to diminish the height of, and quantity of masonry in the substructure and to improve the appearance of these portions of the design.

In the south approach there are 15 spans ranging from 300 feet down to 160 feet, the lengths and depths of these spans being varied in approximate proportion to the height of grade above the water. From the last span shown on the southerly side, the highway and electric car tracks are carried upon a solid embankment, with sloping rock—built sides, the railway being upon an elevated structure over the middle of the highway.

The approach viaduct, upon the curve on the Montreal side, is a structure simulating an arch viaduct, with full centre round arched trusses, having a sufficient centre depth to be self-supporting and to exert no horizontal thrust upon the substructure, under vertical loads.

It is proposed to use the European style of all riveted connections throughout, no eye-bars or pin connections being used, excepting possibly in anchorages. While the pin connected method of bridge construction is preferred by the majority of bridge engineers in the United States, short span bridges excepted, the riveted method is almost exclusively used in Europe, and the immense Forth bridge, the largest rigid bridge in the world, stands as a conspicuous precedent for the employment of this system of construction for bridges of' exceptional magnitude.

The bridge has been designed to carry a heavy train of locomotives and cars upon both of the railway tracks with a proper allowance for the travel upon the highways and sidewalks, and for wind pressures, and with working strains ranging from "6 to 13 of the breaking strength of the material, according to position and duty.

It is proposed to use mild open hearth steel throughout, having an ultimate tensile strength from 60,000 to 72,000 pounds per square inch, and with restrictions as to the amount of phosphorus and sulfur, the impurities which, if contained in excess, are most prejudicial to the good quality of' steel, and its ability to resist impact, or sudden blows or shocks.

The estimated weight of structural steel is 37,000 tons of 2,000 pounds, and the estimated cost of the superstructure is $3,514,000

A WORD OF CAUTION. <article title=" A WORD OF CAUTION " author="Shaw, Edward C.">

THE enthusiastic Canadian student of architecture who may be planning a visit to the Paris Exhibition of 1900, will do well to remember that in some of the Provincial towns a person attempting to make a sketch in the streets is liable to find himself arrested and held by the police as the emissary of a foreign nation which is preparing for the invasion and conquest of the republic. The absurdity of such official interference appears to have dawned upon the mind of the Prefect of Police of Paris, for an order was recently issued that artists and photographers are not to be interfered with unless by reason of them crowds of people congregate and impede the traffic in the streets.



PRISMATIC GLASS.

ONE of the latest and probably most important importants in building material is the prismatic glass for transoms and sidewalks, introduced by the Prismatic Glass Company a few months ago. This window glass is made in small squares, which are put together with lead or other material to suit size of windows or transoms. The inner surface of the glass is covered by horizontal ridges or half prisms. These half prisms are so constructed that when a light ray which falls naturally at an angle of about 45 degrees passes through this glass it becomes refracted or bent upwards and is carried out horizontally into the interior of a room instead of falling to the ground or floor at the natural angle. This is a very simple contrivance, but the result is wonderful. In one jewelry store in Toronto, where the glass has been introduced, before using the prismatic glass, upwards of 40 and on cloudy days So incandescent lights were required to give sufficient light in he interior. Since using prismatic glass the proprietors of the store say that they have not required any artificial light except on very dark days, and that they have saved from $40 to $80 per month in their artificial light bills The same result has been experienced by three of the largest departmental stores in Toronto who are using the glass. Architects and owners who have used prismatic glass are emphatic in their praise of its result.

The sidewalk lights work on a somewhat different principle. The rear surface of each prism acts as an independent reflector and an ingenious but simple arrangement is made so as to provide for the slant of a sidewalk, and still allow these reflectors to throw light into the interior of a basement without being diverted or tilted up, which is the result in most pendant or prismatic sidewalk lights.

Although only on the market for a few months in Canada, both prismatic window glass and the sidewalk lights have met with

portant merchantile and commerlarge sales and nearly all the imcial buildings erected in the principal cities in Canada have been fitted out with this glass.

The use of this glass does away with the necessity of light wells and sky lights, which always serve as fire traps and use up valuable space.

The City of Venice has announced its intention of holding a second International Art Exhibition, to contain pictures, sculptures, etchings, and drawings, from April 22 to October 31, 1897. Prizes for the best works to the amount of not less than 40,000 lire will be awarded by an international jury of artists. The Municipality of Venice will grant three prizes of 1,500, 1,000 and 500 lire respectively for the best critical essays on the exhibition, published during the first month after the opening. Artists must give notice of their intention to exhibit not later than January 1

The Building News.



As it is often difficult to obtain any information concerning the inside height of a church or other building, Korber mentions in the '' Deutsche Techniker Zeitung " that he has found toy balIons very useful for this purpose. The string must, of course, be very light. A straw smeared with a little glue placed at the top of the balloon helps to keep it in position for a few moments. It may, unfortunately, prove quite as difficult to procure a toy balloon good enough for the purpose as to hunt up papers and drawings containing the desired information But Korber is not wrong, when he says that somebody might prepare balloons specially for this purpose.
