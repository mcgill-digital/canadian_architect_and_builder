TINTERN ABBEY, WEST DOOR—MEASURED DRAWINGS BY STEPHEN

A. HEWARD.



Tintern Abbey is in Monmouthshire, and is of easy access from Bristol or Clifton across the Channel.

To the student in search of Gothic examples, Tintern gives excellent opportunities of study—the condition of the ruins inside the abbey, being such, ruinous enough yet riot too much so, as to allow of examining many details that are on the ground and of also seeing them in position in other places—one of the advantages of a ruin.

but externally both it and the aisle are 16 sided. At each external angle of the building is a flying buttress to resist tile  thrust of the vaulting originally designed to be of stone, but which idea was subsequently abandoned and a plastered ceiling simulating the interlacing ribs of the original design substituted.



The inside diameter of tile dome is 87 ft. 6 inches, arid its height 140 ft. the outside diameter of the building, 127 ft. exclusive of buttresses, but 146 ft. inclusive of buttresses.

The walling is of local limestone faced with local sandstone and the dressings of sandstone from Ohio, excepting the voussoirs of tire flying buttresses, which are of heavy bedded local limestone. The roof and lantern have iron principals, wooden rafters and wooden roof boards covered with copper. The inside walls and dome are plastered.

In the circular interior wall of the dom is a door corresponding to each side of the outer wall, one of which doors leads into the Parliament House, one to an external entrance, and the others to the rooms into which the leanto is divided. Against the circular

PARLIAMENT LIBRARY BUILDING, OTTAWA-—MESSRS. FULLER &



JONES, STENT & LAVER, AND THOMAS FULLER, ARCHITECTS.



Although usually spoken of as a separate building, it forms part of the Parliament building. It was included in tile original design for which Mr. Fuller received the first premium in 1859, arid the building as completed conforms closely to the original design. Construction was commenced in 1860, but when the buildings were occupied in 1866 the library walls were covered in above the lean-to. In 1868 the construction was resumed, but it was not until 1877 that the building was completed and filled up for occupation.



The building consists of a dome surmounted by a lantern and surrounded by a lean-to aisle, Internally the dome is circular,

wall of the dome are three stories of bookcases with returns in wards towards the centre at each door, leaving a radial passage on floor arid each gallery. All the bookcases and galleries are of white pine, lire gallery floors ground glass, arid the railings wrought iron. The woodwork ir elaborately carved in floral designs. The flooring of the dome is in Canadian woods.

In the centre of tire floor space is a pedestal supporting a marble statue of Her Majesty the Queen.

The dome receives its day light through large clerestory windows and from the lantern by night incandescent electric light is used.

The heating is indirect from stacks of steampipes in a cruciform passage which divides the basement plan into quadrants. This passage is directly over subterranean air ducts leading from the face of the cliff and the fresh air therefrom when warmed by the steam coils passes up through the floor in large tubes terminating several feet above tire floor line in brass registers.
