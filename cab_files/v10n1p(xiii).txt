KEEP ON ADVERTISING.

No business man not et dead in the shell hut can see even in dull times an opportunity to let the world know that he is alive. In advertising- one's business it is perhaps three times out of four a blind and fatal mistake to leave the public in the dark as to whether the factory is still running- and the owner thereof alive or dead.

No industry that is not overdone or wrongly located can be effectually downed by a spell of depression. Consumers do not quit the world as some gentlemen did in the days of Noah, and if unable to purchase what they need to-day, the same need speaks for itself tomorrow. When the wind is low, mend your sails, and the man who is prepared for the breeze is the man most benefitted by the same.— Power and Transmission.
