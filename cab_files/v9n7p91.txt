IRON, which of late has so largely sup— Iron Construction for superseded brick, stone and wood in the

construction of public and business buildings, is now finding its way into the construction of churches. The frame work of an Episcopal church now in process of erection in New York City and of a Jewish Synagogue at St. Louis, the latter including a central dome, is composed of structural steel. Some months ago it was recorded that a residence was also being built in New York by this method.



IN glancing at the various buildings in

The Grotesque in

	carving,	progress in the city and at those recently completed, where carving to any



extent has been indulged in, it is a little surprising to find how very greatly the grotesque predominates. We might almost say that there is no attempt made to produce a beautiful face for instance, on caps or string— courses, wherever there is a face it is sure to be one with a grin or a squint, and though these are perfectly admissible, yet the endless succession of them becomes wearisome.

What a pleasure it would be to have a few to look at, and what a satisfaction to the artist it would be to produce them.

there was numbered among them a museum. A museum is a very important educational factor, and we quite agree with the statement. In this country (and it must be the same in every new country,") the establishment of a museum is necessarily a very difficult thing. Very few real antiquities or original old works of art are likely to find their way into our collections. Efforts of the most praiseworthy character have been made to establish something of the kind in Toronto, and great success has attended these efforts so far as they have gone. If any one body of educated men can do more than another towards making a museum useful and interesting, that body is the Association of Architects. They must know the immense value as a practical educator of the few casts of Egyptian and Assyrian work that are to be found in the museum of the Ontario Department of Education, and if individual architects would show their appreciation of these things by taking
