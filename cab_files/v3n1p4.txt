I

 t is a very painful duty which we are called upon to perform in recording the death of the respected Vice-President of

the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, Mr. Geo. F. Durand, of London. Mr. Durand had been for a year or more in declining health, induced it is believed by overwork. A vacation which he took last summer made a temporary improvement in his condition, but the strain involved by his large practice speedily destroyed the benefit received. His deep interest in the Ontario Association of Architects led him to attend the recent Convention in Toronto, and render material assistance towards the promotion of the objects which were there considered. His friends were deeply pained on that occasion to observe the ravages which disease had made on a constitution naturally strong, and the indications pointing to the early close of a talented and useful life. Yet, as they bade him good-bye at the close of the Convention, it was not in the expectation that they were wishing him a last farewell. Such, however, it proved to be. In his death, the architectural profession in Canada has lost one of its ablest members, and the Ontario Association of Architects one of its most valuable promoters.

Through the courtesy of <person>Mr. Thos. Tracey</person>, City Engineer of London, and formerly Mr. Durand's partner, we are able to present our readers with a portrait of the deceased, and a few facts concerning his professional career

THE LATE GEO. F. DURAND.

He was born at London, Ont., in the year 1850, and first studied his profession in the office <person>of Mr. William Robinson,</person> former City Engineer of London. When a promising young man he went to Albany, N.Y., where he was employed for a number of years as chief assistant under Mr. <person>Thomas Fuller </person>on the famous new capitol, and where he married Miss Parker, the daughter of a prominent builder. When Mr. Fuller, who is now Chief Architect of the Department of Public Works, Ottawa, severed his connection with the Albany work, Mr. Durand also left, and after a year's engagement in Maine, returned to London, where he went into partnership in 1878 with <person>Mr. Thos. Tracey</person>, under the name of <firm>Tracey & Durand</firm>. This firm was quite successful and dissolved in 1882, when Mr. Tracey was appointed to his present position of City Engineer, and Mr. Durand carried on business for himself, continuing with uninterrupted success until the time of his last illness. Among the important buildings in the city which are monuments of his artistic skill might be mentioned <building>the Masonic Temple London</building>, the addition to the <building>Custom House London</building>, <building>London Club House</building>, <building>Main Exhibition Building (Queen's Park</building>), <building>Canadian Savings and Loan Company Building</building>, <building>R. C. Separate School</building>, <building>the Infantry Barracks (under the Department of Public Works</building>), the <building>new Colborne Street Church</building>, <building>Simcoe Street School</building>, exterior <building>Talbot Street Baptist Church</building>. etc. Many of the large buildings, churches, etc., throughout Western Ontario were designed by him. In the recent competition for the new <building>Toronto Court House</building>, Mr. Durand's plans received second mention, thus receiving first cash prize. An evidence of the esteem in which he was held is found in the fact of his being employed by the Ontario Legislature to erect the new <building>Upper Canada College</building>, and his superintending the construction of the Goderich and Strathroy post-offices under the Dominion Government.

Mr. Durand was a member of St. Andrew's Church, and a prominent Freemason. His wife and four children deplore his loss.

The funeral obsequies were attended by a very large number of persons, including Mr. Fuller, Chief Architect Public Works, Ottawa. The O. A. A., through their Secretary, <person>Mr. S. H.

Townsend,</person> telegraphed the following: "The Directors of the Ontario Association of Architects have learned with deep regret of the death of their confrere, Mr. Geo. F. Durand, and beg to extend their heart-felt sympathy to the members of his bereaved family in their great affliction."

EPORT ON COMPETITIVE DRAWINGS FOR A BATH ROOM.



THE best drawing is that of " Novus Homo," and the fitting of his bath room is unexceptionable, except in the

matter of cost. Marble and tiles are hardly possible in a house of moderate cost, and are certainly not likely to be associated with such contracted space as " Novus Homo" has given. He would have done better to throw the water closet into the bathroom, instead of giving it a separate room, By this means the bathroom would have been made of a more comfortable size, and so far from being out of place in a bath room, the water closet is more convenient there, besides being more private.

"Dado" has a good arrangement, with some defects. The recessed bureau, with a fixed mirror over, and windows above the mirror, would be a great addition to a bathroom, but we hope the drawers under the bureau are only in tended for spare towels and other general bathroom supplies, and not to help forward the slovenly use of the bathroom as a common dressing room, which one often sees. A short bath is a great discomfort and unworthy of a place in a. good bathroom, besides being a fallacy, if intended, as "Dado" proposes, to save hot water, for it takes as much water to cover comfortably a body crouching in a short bath as it does to cover one lying flat. The principal defects of "Dado's" plan is a point upon which he prides himself in his notes----that the pipes of the bathroom and the tank are to be got at from the cupboard of the adjoining bedroom. The tank would be much better exposed in the bathroom and to be got at there, and a bedroom is the last place in which to expose any pipes connected with the sewer. The bathroom and all its connections should be as much isolated from the rest of the house as possible.

The seat in "Bird's Eye's" plan is rather an impertinence. The space would have been better utilized by the closet or to contain the basin. The common character of the details and inferior draughtsmanship militate against the merits of the plan. In other respects, the arrangement is good, and the author may claim the first place in the competition.

<article title="Report on competition for an outside porch" author="">REPORT ON COMPETITION FOR AN OUTSIDE PORCH.



"Mi Yodea" is the most original and in other respects the best design, while the drawing really outclasses the other competitors. Good taste and quaintness are characteristic of its get up, and one of the best points is the snug way in which it fits the house.

For a conventional swell porch, " Utilissimus" will do, as it is well designed in the conventional swell way, but the drawing is poor indeed. For the benefit of the author we might suggest, that in future he omit all unnecessary elaboration in the matter
