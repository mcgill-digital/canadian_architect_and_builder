NOTES.



It is stated that during one month recently, nearly IOO,OOO tons of iron and steel material were imported through the three ports of New York, Philadelphia and Baltimore. The shipment included pig iron, steel billets, steel and iron rails, structural steel arid wire rods, and plate bars. The immediate demand for such products is so great that the domestic plants, extensive as they are, cannot meet it.
