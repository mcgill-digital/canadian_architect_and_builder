of square, cutting the dividing point D, we get the octagon cut which is the line C D. Again, if we divide the space between E and X into three equal parts, making G C one of these parts, and draw a line from C to G cutting the tongue of the square at 7", we get a cut that will give us a mitre for a hexagon, therefore, we see from this, that if we set a steel square on any straight edge or straight line, with 12" and 12" on blade and tongue on the line or edge, we get a true mitre by marking along the edge of the blade ; for an octagon mitre, we set the blade on the line at 12", and the tongue at 5" and

<article title=" TESTS OF DOUGLAS FIR " author="">TESTS OF DOUGLAS FIR.

Builders are familiar with the fact that Douglas fir is among the strongest woods in the world, but figures such as have been prepared for the British Columbia Mills, Timber & Trading Co., of Vancouver, are of especial value to those interested in the subject. This company sent five fir logs to the testing and experimental works of <firm>David Kirkaldy & Son</firm>, of London, England, to be subjected to the severest bending and thrusting tests, and frill data to be returned. The results show in detail that fir is in every respect satisfactory to those who have always insisted that it was one of the best varieties of wood

The specimens give the bending test 12x15 and 16 inches in dimensions, cut to a length of 13½½ feet, with a distance of 12 feet between the supports and the load applied at the center. The mean total stress in pounds and deflection in inches are shown in the following table:

we get the angle on the line of blade—nearly——and for a hexagon cut, we place the blade at 12" On the line, and the tongue at 7, and the line of the blade gives the angle of cut—nearly. The actual figure for octagon is 4 31, 32 but. is close enough, and for a hexagon cut, the exact figures are 12" and 6 15/16, but 12' and 7' is as near as most workmen will require, unless the cut is a very long one.





From '' A Subscriber":—l have a " tile-floor" to lay in a store, and, having had no experience in this kind of work, would like a few "pointers" as to how the work should be done?

ANS.—In the first place, it' the tiles are to be laid on wooden joists, the joists must he deep, say 2' x 12" or 3 x 10" The tops of the joists must he bevelled off to the centre, making the top like an inverted A, and the spaces between the joists must he boarded down about

five inches from the top edge of the joists. On the top of the boarding must be laid concrete to the level of the joists and the whole smoothed off, and while damp a proper layer of Portland cement, not less than an eighth of an inch thick must be floated on the concrete, and on this the tiles must be laid even and level. The tiles must be well soaked in clean water before being laid on the cement. In laying tiles, always begin work in the centre of the room, and work all round until the work is completed. It is best to set straight-edges, level and out of wind with each other, then set all tiles level and true with thin gauges as shown in the illustrations, This will insure neat and level job of work.

The ultimate weight borne by the pieces was 78,714 pounds, or 35. w tons, which was equivalent upon the beam of 93,162 pounds, or 41.6 tons. The timbers were bent to a deflection of five inches and removed.

Those tested to ascertain the resistance to depression were 12x12 and 100 inches long, with the ends faced true in a lathe. The total stress in pounds and depression in inches were as follows

<article title=" CURIOUS CEILINGS " author="">CURIOUS CEILINGS.



A Russian nobleman has hit upon a curious method of ceiling decoration. Every ceiling in his mansion contains a fresco dealing with an episode in the career of his ancestors and the whole forms what is perhaps a unique example of inner roof ornamentation. Nearly 500,000 troubles has been expended upon this extraordinary work, a sum equal to approximately £71,500. Less extravagant, but undoubtedly quite as curious, is the ceiling decoration of a certain London house-holder, who has covered the surface in question with cancelled cheques returned to him through his bank. At first glimpse the real nature of this quaint embellishment is not apparent to the spectator, but the effect of same is said to be positively charming.
