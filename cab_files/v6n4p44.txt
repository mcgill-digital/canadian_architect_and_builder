	44	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT	April, 1893



IN our correspondence department this month will be found a letter on the subject of "tendering for works." No doubt this is an important question, an-I it would be well if a remedy could be found which would prevent the acceptance of tenders at figures below actual market prices, and from parties who have not much reputation to lose should they fail to satisfactorily carry out the works. There are difficulties, however, in placing this matter on such a footing as many contractors would prefer, and it is not an easy matter to interfere with the freedom of contract ; nevertheless, contractors should be required to furnish good security for the due performance of their work. In this way the competition of incompetent and financially irresponsible contractors might be largely avoided.



THE accumulation of snow and ice on the streets of Toronto has been greater during the winter which is about to close, than for many years previous. This, coupled with the fact that the <firm>Street Railway Company </firm>had barely time to get some of its lines into running order when winter set in, placed them at a serious disadvantage so far as preparation for keeping their tracks clear and maintaining an efficient service were concerned. Many of the citizens, appreciating the unusual difficulties against which the company have had to contend, have been both greatly pleased and astonished at the energy and skillful management by which a first-class service has been provided throughout the winter. It is safe to say that more serious difficulties are never likely to be met with in the future operation of the

system.	_______________________







THERE has been a substantial increase of late in the price of Canadian lumber, due to an increased demand for the same in the United States market. This should have the effect of increasing considerably the cost of building, but if we are rightly informed such will not be the case so far at least as Toronto is concerned. The greatly reduced volume of building enterprises during the last two years has given rise to excessive competition for such contracts as have been offered, and thus the advance in material is offset by lower tenders. We are informed that stone work is being done at eight dollars per to use, and brickwork, which a few years ago cost fifteen dollars per thousand, costs at present but eleven dollars. And this, notwithstanding that the price of labor has greatly advanced in recent years. _______________________





THE fire losses in the City of Montreal during the first three months of the current year amount to upwards of half a million dollars. These losses, it is stated, will absorb three-fourths of the insurance companies' premiums for the year. So serious a condition of affairs has led to an investigation of the condition of the fire-Protective appliances and of the fire department. As a result, the water pressure is declared to be insufficient, the pumping plant at the waterworks inadequate, and the fire department not up to the standard of efficiency required. The insurance companies have in consequence decided to advance rates 25 to 30 per cent. on certain classes of risks. This will no doubt lead to improvements being made which will lessen the opportunity for such destructive conflagrations as have this year visited the city.



Some architects profess to be able to see no advantages to be derived from connection with the 0. A. A., and have withdrawn from membership therein. They appear to have overlooked or underestimated all benefits accruing from the Association to the profession, except such as might be computed in dollars and cents. This view of the subject must be admitted to be a narrow and selfish one. Notwithstanding, we have information which indicates that membership in the Association carries with it a certain monetary value. The Public School Board of a certain town in Ontario were about to erect a school building. Two architects sought to secure the work. The question was asked of each of them "Are you a member of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>?" The reply in one case was in the affirmative in the other in the negative. The choice turned on this point, the Board at once selecting the architect who was a member of the Association. They required some guarantee as to the competency of the person they would employ to carry out the work, and membership in the 0. A. A. was considered sufficient.

IT has been universally acknowledged that there is greater economy in machinery as compared with hand labor, but the application of motive power to the various branches of joinery has not been extensively appreciated. It is impossible to overrate the value and importance of machinery in joiners' shops, yet the use of such machinery can be overdone. A proper number of machines is most essential, but four machines will he  generally found sufficient, viz. a portable deal frame capable of sawing at one time two deals (14x4) into boards of any required thickness, a self acting saw-bench, a planing machine, and a general joiner which will do all the necessary working tenoning and such work usually executed by hand. These machines can be worked by a 12 horse power steam or electric motor, and, if solidly fixed on stone bases, they can be driven at great speed without vibration. There seems a general idea that machinery can only pay in very large establishments, and unless a builder can have separate machines for each operation he had better be contented with hand labor. But we are lead to believe that every man having a thriving business would find a great saving could be effected by a moderate outlay on machinery of this description. ______________________





It is a frequent subject of complaint on the part of successful architects that features of their designs which have been thought out at the expense of much time and mental effort, are appropriated by persons claiming to be architects, but who are without the ability or disposition to evolve original ideas of their own. An effort was recently made by the Ontario Association of Architects to secure under the Copyright Act protection for the authors of architectural designs, but it was found not to be practicable to do so Our attention recently called to a case of pirating which will serve to illustrate the audacity of those engaged in the business. A Toronto architect recently met the officials of a church in a neighboring town, who had under consideration the erection of a new edifice, and was shown another set of drawings which had been submitted. These proved to he an exact tracing from one of his own designs. A copy of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER in which the design was published a couple of years ago has since been forwarded to the building corn committee It is a satisfaction to know that in this instance at least the pirate has unintentionally played into the hands of the architect the reward of whose labor he sought to reap.



AT the recent convention of the <assoc>National Association of Builders </assoc>a member introduced a resolution providing that means be taken to secure the affiliation of the Canadian builders' exchanges. The secretary is reported to have moved in amendment that action on the resolution be deferred until after annexation. This, from the Canadian standpoint, will be taken to mean that the question has been shelved

It may be for years

or it may be forever."

The principal advantage to be derived by Canadian builders from affiliation with the National Association would be the opportunity afforded them to learn the benefits to be secured from a Canadian organization, and the lines upon which it might be successfully conducted. It would be impossible for more than perhaps half a dozen Canadian delegates to attend the conventions of the National Association, and being so few in number, they could not expect to exercise much influence or secure proper consideration of questions affecting the building interests of this country. For this purpose there are required Canadian Associations fir the (different provinces which should meet semi-annually or annually as do the Architectural Associations of Ontario and Quebec, to consider legislation, forms of contract, prices for labor and other matters of like importance affecting the building interests. The <assoc>Toronto Builders' Exchange</assoc>, which is itself an example of the benefits accruing from local organization, might well take the iniatory steps to bring about the formation of a provincial association.



IT is said that the City of Toronto has as great an extent of shop fronts as the cities of Buffalo, Detroit and Rochester combined. Toronto is said to have 27 miles of shop fronts, while Buffalo has only 13 miles. Circumstances are at work in Toronto, which will probably largely transform the character of some of the principal thoroughfares, such as King and Yonge
