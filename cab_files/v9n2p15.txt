To Mr. Frank Darling, the retiring Proposed Amendments

to the 0. A. A. Act,	president of the 0. A. A., is due the credit of having delivered at the opening



of the recent annual convention, a highly practical address. It may safely be sad that to the majority of the members of the Association, who recognize in Mr. Darling the possessor of high artistic attainments, the intensely practical character of his remarks came as a complete surprise. There was no disappointment on this score, however, as every one felt that the address was full of valuable suggestion and sound logic, befitting the occasion. Mr. Darling largely devoted his remarks to showing- the reasonableness of the amendments which the Association are seeking to have made to the Ontario Architects' Act. He undoubtedly presents a strong case, and one which clearly has justice as its foundation. We desire to emphasize two or three points which the members of the Legislature and others interested should keep clearly in mind. 1st. The desired amendments to the Architects' Act would not prevent any person from preparing plans for and carrying out the construction of buildings as at present. The only restriction would be in the use of the title '' Architect." No unqualified person would be permitted to call himself an '' Architect," although he might, under a different title, perform the work of an architect. This restriction is desired in order that those who invest their capital in new buildings may know who are qualified to design and erect the same in a manner that will not involve risk of financial loss to the owner and injury to health or loss of life to the occupants. It is compulsory on the surveyor who lays out the site of a new building that he shall give proof of his qualifications ; how much greater the necessity for such proof in the case of the man into whose hands are entrusted capital, health, and even life itself? 2nd. As every person at present practising architecture in Canada would be given three months in which to register under the Act, without being required to give proof of qualification, no injury or injustice could result to them. 3rd. '[hose who are seeking to have the Act amended have nothing in view beyond a desire to safeguard the public interest, and elevate the standard of architectural practice in this country. As the benefits of the legislation would not be felt to any extent for twenty-five or thirty years, it is clear that the practising architects of the present day can expect to derive no personal advantage therefrom. 4th The School of Architecture established by the government in connection with the School of Practical Science,
