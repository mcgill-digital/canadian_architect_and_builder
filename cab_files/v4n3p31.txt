Work on the skating rink, the re-construction of which has been delayed for nearly two years owing to some misunderstanding between the directors and the Federal Government, is to he started as soon as the weather permits.

Several private residences and some stores are talked of for St. John Street, but at the time of writing the elections are so absorbing that nothing else receives much attention.

The Fortress Hotel ' Co. receive tenders for their proposed new building on 19th . The lowest tenders are Quebecers. Several Montreal and one Brockville contractor also made bids. The plans upon which tenders were called were those made by <firm>Messrs. Rotch & Tilden</firm>, Boston.

The building is being constructed by day work, with <person>Mr. Leggs </person>as superintendent, from plans prepared by <person>H. Staveley</person>, architect.

<assoc>TORONTO ARCHITECTURAL SKETCH CLUB</assoc>.

THE members listened to a paper of unusual interest on Tuesday, 24th inst., given by Mr. <person>G. A. Reid</person>, R.C.A. The subject was "Architecture from an Artist's Standpoint." Mr. Reid showed his appreciation of architecture by the many clever points made during the course of the evening, his numerous sketches in oils and pastel bringing the subject before his attention in a very lucid and pleasing way. It is intended to publish the paper in full in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for April, illustrated by pen and ink drawings by Mr. <person>F. S. Challener </person>from the original sketches.

An interesting discussion followed the paper, in which Messrs. Darling, Sam Jones, Curry, Simpson, Gregg and others took part.

The competitive drawings for "A Stone Mantel" were then criticized by Mr. <person>Frank Darling </person>in his usual facile manner, Mr. <person>E. B. Jarvis </person>being awarded first place in the senior division, and Mr. <person>Ernest Rolph </person>first place in the junior division.

It is a fact for congratulation to the Club that it has to a large extent the co-operation of the architects in its work, and especially so that a number of the younger architects enter the competitions. It is hoped in time that more will be induced to go in

for them, as it is one of the primary objects of the Club that this should be so. The impression that the competitions ought to be restricted to draughtsmen anti students is entirely erroneous and utterly incompatible with the feeling of the constitution.

At this meeting it was resolved by a majority vote of those present that the regular meetings should be held on Monday instead of Tuesday as heretofore, and in accordance with this, the next meeting was held on Monday, 9th inst. Mr. <person>W. A. Langton </person>gave a clever paper on "<person>Richardson</person> and His Works," which was- listened to attentively by all present. At the close quite a lively discussion took place. As Mr. Langton spent a number of years in Mr. Richardson's office in Boston, lie was well prepared to speak on the subject, and did so in a most interesting manner, receiving a hearty vote of thanks for his trouble.

THE R. C. A. EXHIBITION.

THE Royal Canadian Academy exhibition has attracted considerable attention, and copious comments and criticisms have appeared in the daily papers with attractions attempts at illustration. The anticipations formed by the reading of some of these criticisms are rudely shocked in many cases when the spectator finally reaches the gallery and sees for himself. One cannot help feeling that their remarks are in some cases tempered by personal on other interests. It would be refreshing to have an estimate of the exhibition as a whole and a critique of the individual efforts from some authority, unbiased and competent.

The architectural exhibit is snugly ensconced in the Secretary's den, and modestly greets the persistent seeker after architectural art. It is well that it is thus enshrined, as the baker's dozen representing our glorious art would be hopelessly lost were it placed in one of the larger rooms.

We must confess to a feeling of real disappointment when we finally reached the sanctum. The sketches of a residence on St. George street by <person>Mr. Townsend</person>, two designs for churches by Messrs. <firm>Strickland & Symons</firm>, and a view in Ghent, Belgium, by Mr. <person>Andrew Taylor</person>, were the only numbers which could be singled out as even fairly rendered. Mr. Taylor's design for a residence had the fault of being stiffly inked in before being colored; his Branch Bank of Montreal did not err in this respect. but lacked all attempts at light and shade. Mr. Storm's perspective of the new Victoria College is somewhat effective as-hen viewed at a distance, but coarse and rough when studied near enough to take in the design. The rendering of two hotises by Messrs. <firm>Gordon & Helliwell </firm>and <person>Mr. Taylor</person>Technical College Building is scratchy and devoid of light and shade. On the whole one cannot help feeling that there is a want of imagination betrayed by the majority of the exhibitors, anti that 'many old friends are still playing on the same string as of yore—their trees, them rocks, waves and beaches, their homely human beings are the same old acquaintances.





The finer kind of coal ashes from domestic fires make excellent cement when used with common lime, the cement being four or five times as strong as common mortar. Those from steam boilers seem to be of sand in ordinary lime mortar made at too high a temperature for this, but can be used in ware.
