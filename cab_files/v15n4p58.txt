or halls two or more radiators can he used, or radiators can be supplied of a design containing six or more lamps, although the first method is preferable, as the heat can be taken to the point where most wanted a special feature being their portability. But the most important is that they provide pure warm air, no oxygen being consumed by them, nor are any noxious fumes given off. Their appearance is certainly bright and cheerful, and there are no ashes or dirt to be removed after their use.

<article title=" GRAHAM V. BOURGUE " author="">GRAHAM V. BOURGUE. Judgment by Judge <person>Lount</person>, in single court at Toronto, on appeal by defendant from report of the County Judge of Carleton, to whom the matters in dispute were referred under R.S.O. ch, 62 sec. 29, in action for price of goods sold and delivered. The contract was for delivery of a quantity of bricks subject to approval of Engineer of City of Ottawa, and to requirements of defendants. The Judge below found that defendants had made default in payment of a promissory note for $1,750, which fell due on July 17, 1900, and which had been given by defendants for bricks delivered under the contract, and that this default was conclusive evidence that defendants were unable or unwilling to make payment, and in either case that plaintiff was justified in assuming that defendants did not intend plaintiff or themselves to he bound by the contract. Held, referring to <person>Furth</person> v. <person>Barr</person>, 9 C.P. at pp. 213, 214, that there must be an absolute refusal to perform in which non-payment is an clement, and that such had not been shown, and that the evidence showed that defendants had paid a fair price for bricks which they were obliged to order by reason of failure of plaintiff to deliver, and therefore they should succeed on their counterclaim. Judgment for plaintiff for $ too. to, with costs of action, except costs of counterclaim, and for defendants for costs of counterclaim. Costs of appeal to defendants.

Delamere for defendant, <person>M. S. Hooper</person>, moved in the Divisional Toronto, to set aside judgment of the District Court of Judicial District of Rainy River, or for a new trial. Action against defendants to recover $460 on balance due for work done upon and materials supplied for a house in the Town of Rat Portage, by plaintiffs. The defendants are husband and wife, and the house is the wife's property. The trial judge found that tile husband made the contract, gave all tile orders for work and materials except on two or three occasions, when appelant acted, hut that plaintiffs thought she was acting for her husband that after the work was complete plaintiffs accepted the husband's promissory note for the balance due, which note still remains unpaid, but that subsequently discovering that appelant owned the house, seek to charge her as an undisclosed principal. Under these circumstances he held the case to be within <person>Davidson</person> v. <person>McClelland</person>, 32 O.R.. 382; that on the evidence the appellant was an undisclosed principal, and in the absence, as here, of any alteration in the account to tile principal's prejudice, the contractor was entitled to recover, but must elect which to charge, and lie had not yet done so, not being aware of the facts; and that though a lien had not been registered, plaintiffs were entitled to the presumption created by R.S.O. cit. 153, sec. 5. Judgment was entered against defendants for default of defence, hut afterwards the appallent was let in, by order of the court to defeat, and after the trial the judge endorsed the record "let judgment be signed for plaintiffs for $442.07, as against <person>Mary S. Hooper</person>, with costs, upon plaintiffs electing to abandon against <person>Frederick T. Hooper</person>." <person>C. A. Masten</person>, for plaintiff, contra. The court were of opinion that in the interest of justice the respondent must be given an opportunity to make art application to the court below to get rid of the judgement against the husband, as the order made allowing defendant M. S. Hooper in to defend destroyed the plaintiff's cause of action. Whatever order is made upon such application is to form part of this appeal, which is adjourned accordingly. Leave to appellant to consent within ten days to this appeal being dismissed without costs.



Under file heading " Bad for the Contractor," the London Contract Journal says :--—-The arbitration case between <firm>Ford and Co.</firm>, and <firm>Bemrose and Sons, Limited</firm>, which came before tile Court of Appeal, and upon which judgment was given last week,

deserves careful attention The facts of the case lie in a nutshell. Messrs <firm>Bemrose and Sons </firm>wished to build a new factory and appointed an architect to get out the plans and specification. These were got out accordingly, and such plans add specification, together with a bill of quantities, were at the service of intending contractors. Messrs <firm>Ford and Co.</firm> tendered for the work at a price of ten thousand five hundred and fifty nine pounds, the works were completed in due course, and disputes arose about the final certificate, the contractors claiming a sum of over five thousand pounds, whereas the final certificate allowed one thousand five hundred and thirty pounds odd. The contractors claimed that the difference was due because mite bill of quantities was incorrect. There seems to have been common agreement that this was so, and we may, therefore, take this contention as correct. The legal decision practically comes to this, that the specification and plans are the only documents which can be taken into consideration in such a case as this for legal purposes, and we have every reason to know that this is the law of such cases. Although a contractor is supplied with a bill of quantities, he must take that bill of quantities for what the figures are worth, and check each item for himself to be on the safe side. While conditions of contract remain as they usually are in these contracts, it is impossible for a contractor to tender upon a bill of quantities supplied except in a speculative manner, lie may assure the bill of quantities to be approximately correct, he may allow a percentage for error, and by  speculative tendering may come out on the safe side. But this is riot business. The safe plait is to take out his own quantities. It will he seen that if every contract or is compelled to do this, the total cost of so taking out bilk of quantities for tile contracting world must be borne by the works that are construct--that is, must ultimately be paid for by those who have the works constructed. There are great difficulties in the way of safeguarding a contractor against errors if the course suggested is not pursued. it will at once be seen that if a person desires to build a factory, the plants and specifications for which are prepared, also a bill of quantities and tenders be made upon this bill of quantities, yet afterwards it is found that through errors the real cost of the building is very much greater than was contemplated, and if under these circumstances the contractor (who, we must bear in mind, tenders for t he work at a lump sum) claims for the excess cost, the owner may be placed in a very uncomfortable position, inasmuch as ill time first instances the estimated cost was that which he could afford, anal a greater demand might be out of his

power to meet. On the other hand, it seems hard that the contractor should be the loser by spending several thousands of pounds more upon a jolt through errors in a hill of quantities provided for him. As we have said, the Court of Appeal in this case held that the hill of quantities provided did not amount to a warranty by the building owners that the statement of quantities therein contained was correct, and thus the problem before us. Can a specification he so worded as to do justice to both parties in case of error when a hill of quantities is provided and turns out to be incorrect ? We think it can, and are borne out in this view by the method pursued by a very eminent engineer in large practice. Suppose, as is often the case, the bill of quantities provided is assumed to be correct and tenders be made there on Assunte, again, that a tender is accepted. If a limited time is permitted, mite contractors whose render is accepted to check the bill of quantities, that course would result as a rule, in only one contractor having to undergo the expense of a thorough examination, and could always be made for error by means of a schedule of prices At any rate, as the law at present exists, it is quite certain that no contractor cart safely accept figures un-less they are checked in his own office, by those in his own employ. The whole responsibility for correctness rests with him.





A recent issue of the proceedings of the <assoc>American Society of Civil Engineers</assoc> by <person>George W. Rafter</person>, gives the results of some experiment on the consolidation of mortar. For dry mortar mixed in proportions of cement to 1, 2, 3 and 4 of sand, with 15.5 to i7.4 pounds of water per cubic foot of mortar, the average consolidation under ramming for nine experiments was 5.4 percent., the results usually' varying from 4.1 to 6.9, with one result as low as 0.9 amid one as high as 10.9 per cent. For three experiments with plastic mortar, using 16.7 to 19 pounds of water

per cubic foot, the average consolidation was 4 per cent.		The

average of all the results was 5.1 per cent.	the result of	10.9



percent. is attributed to insufficient mixing of the mortar.
