Mr. <person>A. J. Griffin</person>, of Dauphin, Man., writes as follows "I am pleased to see the improvement you are making each year in THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER. The journal is of great benefit to us away out in this Northwest country. Building in Dauphio is not as brisk as it has been, but what is done

now is of a far better class than before."





"More School Houses' is the title of a new pamphlet issued by

Mr. <person>Samuel Cabot</person>, of Boston, showing over twenty new and important School buildings' in which Cabot's Deafening Quilt I has been employed. This has come to be regarded as the standard material for the purpose.

The report comes from St. Johns, Que., that the Macdonald potteries at that place which ceased operations several years ago, have been purchased by a United States Company. It is said to be the intention of the new owners to equip the works with modern machinery and manufacture porcelain goods, enameled baths, etc. on a large scale.
