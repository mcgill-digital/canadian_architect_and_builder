Our readers will he interested in the decision which the British



Court of Appeal has given in the case of <person>Warren W. Brown</person>, which decides very important questions with regard to rights of light. It will flow be the leading case on the question, and probably for very many years will regulate other decisions. The case arose at Leicester. The plaintiff complained that a new building had been erected on the other side of the street, and that it deprived his premises of the light which they had regularly received when the space was quite open. Mr. Justice Wright heard the case at assizes, gave himself much trouble, and presently visited the premises to obtain an accurate idea of what amount inconvenience was sustained. He afterwards reserved judgment to hear a

legal argument in London. He found that the premises undoubtedly could not now receive the same amount of light that they

had previously received, and that substantial damage which he

estimated at £300, had been done, but at the same time he refused to give judgement for thc plaintiff, as he thought abundance of light had been left thc building for all ordinary purposes of residence or business and he added these important words:— "Unless, indeed, there is some such limitation of the right to light for ancient windows, it is difficult, as <person>Lord Hardwicke </person>observed <firm>in Fishmongers' Company </firm>v. <firm>East India Company</firm>, to see how the ordinary extensions and improvements of towns could be carried on. If every house which has existed for 20 years is entitled to have all, or substantially all, the same light come to its windows as during the 20 years, no new houses could bc built opposite to old ones, unless at a distance which would impose on servient tenements an unreasonable burden, and might involve grave public inconvenience." The plaintiff appealed against that decision The argument was heard by the Court of Appeal, and Lord <person>Justice Romer </person>delivered the decision of the Court, the other members of which were thc Lord Chief Justice and Lord Justice <person>Vaughan Williams </person>They reversed the decision arrived at by Mr. Justice Wright and practically said that if ancient lights are interfered with, and that if substantial kind real damage ensues to tenant or owner then the tenant or owner is entitled to relief In so dong they refer to a quoted decision by Lord Justice <person>Mellish</person>. given many years ago, but which unfortunately seems often to have been forgotten. It was:—"I cannot think that it is possible for the law to say that there is a certain Quantity of light which a man is entitled to, and which is sufficient for him, and that thc question is whether he has been deprived of that quantity of light. It appears to me that it is utterly impossible to make any rule or adopt any measure of that kind. It is essentially a question of comparison—whether by reason of deprivation of light the house is substantially less comfortable than it was before."

<article title=" THE ARCHITECT AS ARBITRATOR " author="">THE ARCHITECT AS ARBITRATOR.--The point at issue in a recent case before Justice <person>Buckiner</person> relating to a school at Brighton, Eng., was the extent of an architects powers as arbitrator in a work which was carried out under his superintendence. In 1897 a contract was entered into by Messrs. <firm>Peters & Son </firm>with <firm>the Roedean School Site and Buildings, Ltd</firm>., for the erection of a school at Brighton which was to cost over $43,000 The work was to be completed by September I, 1898. It was agreed that all disputes were to be referred to the architect Mr. <person>J. W. Simpson</person>. As the work was not finished on that date, and the builders became bankrupts, notice was given for determining thc contract, and the building was completed under the architect's direction on June 27, 1901. A final certificate was prepared, which testified that some hundreds of pounds were due Messrs. Peters, Their solicitors then informed thc <firm>Roedean Company </firm>that they claimed damages for improperly determining the contract. Thc company requested the architect to arbitrate on any differences which were

raked. On one side were a <person>Mr. Davis</person>, who possessed an interest in the contractors business, and a <person>Mr. Belcher</person>, who had advanced money to the contractors, besides others who had also claims on the settlement. When, however, the arbitration was about to take place; Mr. Davis's solicitor served on the arbitrator an injunction restraining him from proceeding with thc inquiry. Another protest came from Mr. Belcher. The proceedings were delayed, but eventually the inquiry was held and the award issued on April 9, 1902. On the 11th the company sought to enforce the award, and on thc 14th a writ was issued on behalf of Mr. Belcher in which it was stated that the company had illegally obtained possession of the site and determined the contract. The company were unsuccessful in attempting to stay the action or to enforce the award. The case was therefore brought before the Court of Appeal, the question being whether Mr. Belcher should be permitted to continue his action, as the matters in dispute had been determined by the arbitrator On the other side it was contended that the trustee for the contractors had a right ful claim to be paid quantum merit for work and materials. As they were not allowed to complete the work under thc contract, the contract itself was at an end, and the whole should be measured up. The master of the Rolls and the Lords  Justices came to the conclusion that as all the parties had agreed to the architect's jurisdiction as arbitrator, they could not after the close of thc proceedings say the award was bad or that the arbitrator had exceeded his powers; the award should be enforced by the company, and Mr. Belchers action stayed. The position of the architect as arbitrator has been therefore once more upheld in a case which presented some novelties.
