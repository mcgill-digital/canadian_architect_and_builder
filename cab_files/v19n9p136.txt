The visit of the 18th August was to the little town of Ste. Genevieve on the Riviere des Prairies. This

being a village of some antiquity, there exists in the























































vicinity a number of old, interesting stone houses some of which have interesting gate posts and other accessories. The church which is dated 1854 is of good architecture and interesting both outside and in. We



















































give a view of the interior and also a view of a picturesque house which is unfortunately falling to ruin.



Messrs. <firm>Johnson, Calderon & Lines</firm>, architects Edmonton Alta., have dissolved partnership and Messrs. Johnson and Lines will in future carry on the business in the old offices in the Lee block.

As the season advances the appearance of business in building operations increases. On many streets huge piles of brick and of stone, accumulated in readiness to place whenever the concrete foundations are ready to receive them, block up one third of the roadway and dispense with the necessity of wooden boardings. The number of permits for new buildings naturally begins to slacken. Some of the more important recently issued are as follows:

Extensions to Olier school, Roy street, for the Catholic School Commissioners, consisting of the addition of two new wings at a cost of $67,000.

Extension to Messrs. <person>H. Morgan's </person>property on Beaver Hall Hill, estimated to cost $55,000.

Church of the Messiah, (Unitarian), Sherbrooke street, <firm>Ed. & W. S. Maxwell</firm>, architects, to cost $60,000.

Proprety 83, Amherst street, for W. Clark, $28,000.

Additions to National and <firm>Chemical Drug Company</firm>'s premises, St. Gabriel street, to cost $18,300

The following monthly record of building permits clearly shows how busy things are this season

	 January	    65,975

	 February	    158,481

	  March	   262,215 

	April	873.44O

	May	855,580

June	$ 2,343,597

	July	950,135

- August to 23rd	273,800

	Total	5,782,323



Permits for alterations amounted to $728,162, making a grand total of $6,510,485. The total for the whole of 1905 was $5,590,698.

In connection with this it is to be hoped that the increased municipal revenue said to amount to $300,000 which results from the increased value of real estate, will be applied to the improvement of the city. The state of the streets and pavings it must be admitted call most loudly for attention. While so much building is going on it is also urgent that attention should be directed to the improvement of Street communications and to the more spacious treatment of the streets themselves. Another object which would have the sympathy of all interested in the appearance and well being of the city is the long deferred purchase of the balance of St. Helen's Island, which would make it second only to the Mount Royal Park as a city recreation ground. The price asked by the Crown is $200,000, which of course would swallow up a large proportion of the looked for surplus, but the ground is not likely to become any cheaper, and its desirability admits of no doubt. This park is the more important because the facilities, which might even be largely extended, for swimming. The city itself it not too well provided with swimming baths and the opportunities afforded by the island in this way are amongst the natural advantages of the city which for the sake of the health and vigour of the people it would be criminal not to make the most of. Another application comes from the Superintendent of Parks who points out that there is no regular supervision of the public monuments of the city and that in consequence some of these are in danger of lapsing into disrepair, that notably of Sir John Macdonald in Dominion Square is said to be in danger of falling.

A very regrettable thing is happening in regard to
