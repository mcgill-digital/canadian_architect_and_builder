<doctype type="text;ad">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



Trenton, Black River, and Chazy formations are extensively quarried at many places for building stones, as well as for the manufacture of lime and cement.

Extensive slate quarries are found in Eastern Quebec, at Melbourne and Danville.

Ontario abounds in building stones of many kinds and often of excellent quality. The old crystaline rocks of the Laurentian country yields granites and gneisses, generally red or reddish colors, as well as marbles like those of Arnprior and Barrie. Limestones and Sandstones are quarried in a great number of places in the southern and thickly inhabited parts of the province, chiefly for local use, hut also for the supply of the larger cities and to a small extent for export. Clays and shales of different kinds largely employed in making bricks, drain-tiles, terracotta, &c. The manufacture of lime and hydraulic cement also constitute important industries, deposits of shell-marlane being utilized to a considerable

extent for the last named purpose, It will be observed that, taken together, materials applicable to purposes of construction represent a large proportion of the total mineral output of Ontario.

In concluding this article we cannot avoid commenting upon the somewhat unsatisfactory nature of the official catalogue of this exhibition, at least so far as the stone exhibits are concerned. Even the fine display of Canadian building stones, particulars of which have been given above, is dismissed in the catalogue in a few lines, and many of the other specimens are not even mentioned. As this is one of the few things for which a charge is made, it seems a pity that it should not form a more complete record of this most interesting exhibition.



An agreement has been reached with the structural iron workers by which the strike in Toronto is at an end. The new rate of wages is from 27½ cents per hour for first-class to 22½ cents per hour for inferior grades of workmen.
