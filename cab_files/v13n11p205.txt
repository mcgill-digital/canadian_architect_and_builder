A COMMITTEE of the City Council of Toronto has under consideration the subject of the inspection of elevators by

the municipality. Considering the number of accidents which have occurred, there appears to be need for such inspection, The number of elevators in use in the city is placed at 1,000 and the number of persons using them at 40,000. Presuming this estimate to be approximately correct, it will be seen how great is the liability of accident if the mechanism of these elevators, and the competency of the persons who may be placed in charge of their operation, is not placed under proper supervision and control.



Fitting public recognition has been made of the services rendered to Canada and the Empire by the members of the

first Canadian contingent who recently returned from South Africa. Without doubt a hearty welcome home also awaits the members of the second contingent on their return. But what of the brave lads who laid down their lives in defence of the flag? It is not too early to consider what steps should be taken to express in the form of permanent and suitable memorials the nation's undying appreciation of their valor. While public enthusiasm is aroused as never before in our history, this matter should receive attention. In addition to a National memorial at Ottawa, there should also be memorials erected in the principal cities of the various provinces of the Dominion. Toronto probably could not do better than erect a permanent memorial arch on the site of the temporary one at the entrance to Queens Avenue through which the soldiers passed on their return to the

Soldiers' Memorials.
