H THE Royal institute of British Architects nave decided that women may take part in the Institute examinations, and the proposal to admit them to membership in the Architectural Association is at present the Subject of a lively discussion in the pages of the official organ of that body.



THE Commissioner of Customs states that notwithstanding a protective duty of 50 per cent., large quantities of wire goods and slate are exported from the United States to Australia, and  he sees no reason why manufacturers of these goods in Canada should not compete with the Americans for the Australian trade.



SOME particulars have reached us of the invention by a Canadian of a process which promises to revolutionize the present methods of clay working in connection with the manufacture of brick, terra cotta, drain pipe, etc. It is stated that by this process the time required for the manufacture of materials of this description will be reduced in a wonderful degree with a somewhat proportionate reduction in cost of production. As the inventor has not yet secured the protection of his discovery by letters patent, it would not be just to him that we should make public at present any further particulars concerning it, but we hope to be in a position to do so at an early date.



IN the annual report of the Secretary of the National Association of Builders, presented at the annual convention of that body held recently in Boston, it is made to appear that there are upwards of 40 Builders' Exchanges in the Dominion of Canada, and in affiliation with the National Association. We have no hesitation in declaring this statement to be totally incorrect. There are not a dozen Builders' Exchanges or Associations in Canada, and not half a dozen in affiliation with the American Association. We would be pleased to see the builders of Canada as well organized as the report of the Secretary of the National Association would imply them to be.



A BILL has been introduced in the Ontario Legislature which provides for the taxing of church buildings. Petitions have also been addressed to the Legislature by the City of Hamilton and other municipalities praying for the enactment of legislation with this object. The passing of such a law would doubtless affect very materially the cost of many church buildings erected in the future, a result which would scarcely be appreciated by architects, whose commissions are usually based on the cost of the building. It would have a good effect, however, in the direction of restraining church trustees and committees from vying with each other as at present in the erection of expensive churches, the funds for which must in most instances be raised by heavy mortgages.



MR. WAITE, of Buffalo, the architect of the new Legislative buildings at Toronto, is said to have recently preferred a claim for commission, amounting to about $28,000 in addition to the $38,000 or more which has already been paid to him by the Government. It will be remembered that the original limit of cost of the buildings was $750,000, and that notwithstanding the designs submitted by Canadian architects were thrown out because the tenders on them exceeded this amount, Mr. Waite was afterwards given the work and allowed to expend nearly a million and a half upon it. It is said that the understanding was that he was to be paid a commission of 5 per cent. on the original estimated cost. However this may have been, he now demands his commission on the full cost of the building.
