<article title=" NOTES.

" author="">NOTES.



A well-known Venetian engineer, Signor Vendraso, states that the tower of San Giorgio Dei Greci is in danger of falling. This



fine campanile, which is nearly 200 ft. in height, is more than 400 years old. The inclination of the tower, which was observed to be about 18 in. in 1889, has been slowly increasing, until now it is more than 3 ft. Out of the perpendicular. In his opinion the campanile must soon succumb unless immediate measures are taken to restore it.
