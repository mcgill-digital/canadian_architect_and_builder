The committee appointed in 1899 by the <assoc>Austrian Society of Engineers and Architects </assoc>to report on "Specifications for the loading of structures, and the working stresses of materials of construction" has just (January, 1902) published the results of a two years labor. The following figures compiled from the report by Mr. F'.

<person>C.	Kunz</person>, assistant to vice-president, Engineering Department, <firm>American Bridge Company</firm>, are of great interest for comparisons, says the Engineering Record, as they practically cover the same ground as our building laws. Items of local interest only, like data for special timber and for special stones, have been omitted. All figures are given in round numbers.



The figures have been carefully revised and such changes made as were necessary to adapt them to Canadian materials. The tables may be safely followed being based on 2200 lbs. to the ton. The table of working stresses is a little mixed, particularly that portion relating to timber, as the kinds of timber are not shown. However this matters but little as the calculations seem to have been made with some of the weaker woods.
