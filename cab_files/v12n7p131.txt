for one. Time and again, architectural clubs have been formed, but after a season or two have disappeared. The present club has put its existence on record through North America by its action in sending Mr. J. P.

Ontario. Many garden perennials failed to come up in the spring and will no doubt be noted by gardeners. A failure more interesting to architects is that of the Boston ivy and privet. Strong privet hedges many years old are dead on top and have had to be cut down from six feet high to about two feet. Young plants of Boston ivy, put in round new houses at the close of the summer are all dead, but worse than that is the destruction to old and well grown plants. The standard example in Toronto was Mr. George Gooderharn's house which was covered up to the cornice with a thick growth of Boston ivy. This is now cut down to the ground. The work of ten years has to be begun again. The fact that plants on the north side of a building are safe, shows that the destructive agency was not the cold alone, but the cold in connection with a comparatively strong sun; and the cause of damage was really the absence of a bed of snow on the ground, to lie about the roots and stem, and protect them from the warmth of the sun at a time when it was death to the plant if the sap moved. There is nothing to equal the
