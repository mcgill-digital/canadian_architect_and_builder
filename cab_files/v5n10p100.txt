rather than to 'architects, simply However, for my part, I am of opinion that, having accepted the Acts, such as they were, the profession made a great mistake in not assuming the name required. I think that until the members of both Associations look seriously into the question, and assume the title given them, they will not, nor cannot have all the benefits, because, as it was pointed out by the President, up to and until the formation of this society, anyone could arrogate to himself the title of architect, and any one can still, and how are the public to distinguish? I think for my part that architects are foolish in not availing themselves of the protection, meagre as it is, afforded them by the act In conclusion, gentlemen, allow me to thank you for the cordial way in which you have drunk the toast."

Some more songs and speeches brought a pleasant and profitable evening to a close.



SECOND DAY.

The members assembled at the Association rooms at 10 o'clock on Friday morning, and entering carriages in waiting, were driven to points of interest in the city. En route to the Royal Victoria Hospital, the attention of the visitors was directed to some of the old landmarks, such as the building which served as the residence of the first Governor of Lower Canada, now doing humble duty as a coach-house; the old Legislative buildings, now a hotel , the site of the old city wall, which still bears the appropriate name of "Fortification Lane"; Ontario street, formerly traversed by a creek, on the frozen surface of which when in youth some of the leading architects of the present (lay were accustomed to practice on the "ringing steel "It is such features of reminiscence as these which go to make a city interesting," exclaimed one of the visitors, a remark in which everybody could coincide.

At the <building>Royal Victoria Hospital </building>the party were taken in charge by <person>Mr. Rhind</person>, under whose supervision the large buildings have been erected, and by whom the points of most interest in their construction were shown and explained Those of our readers who examined the illustration of these buildings which we published a year or more ago, will remember that the site is irregular and uneven, yet this fact, which would ordinarily be regarded as a disadvantage, has by the skill of the designer actually been turned to advantage, whereby the bottom storey of one wing is on a level with the top storey of the other. The buildings have been erected of Montreal stone, and present an enduring appearance. The planning, being the work of Messrs. <firm>Saxon Snell & Son</firm>, the noted hospital architects, of London, was the subject of much interest. The buildings, which will cost about half a million dollars, are nearing completion, and will it is expected be ready for occupation early next year.

From the Royal Victoria Hospital the party were taken to the new <building>Technological Building Mcgill University Montreal</building>in connection with McGill University, of which Mr. <person>A. T. Taylor </person>is the architect. It is a most substantial structure, and its perfect adaptability to its purpose, evidences the painstaking thought bestowed upon it by the designer The various parts of the building are isolated from one another by fire-proof doors. Professors <person>Bovey</person> and <person>Workman </person>received the visitors in the most cordial manner, and personally conducted them through the building, explaining as fully as time would allow the work which was being done, and the apparatus employed. After a peep into the draughting rooms, pattern rooms, machine shop and blacksmith shop, each fitted with the appliances necessary for imparting instruction of a practical character to the students, they were asked to behold what Prof. Bovey declared to be one of the best equipped testing laboratories in the world

This laboratory contains two testing machines, representing the most perfect English and American patterns, each with a capacity of 100,000 pounds. These machines are operated by means of a small electric motor. They are capable of determining both the tensile and crushing strength of materials. A bar of iron, one inch in diameter, was subjected to a tensile test in the presence of the visitors, and after stretching three quarters of an inch, finally broke under a strain of 40,000 pounds The laboratory also contains a chemical balance capable of weighing 125 pounds or the fraction of a grain, a facsimile to a small scale of the Montreal ] works, by which the head of water necessary to supply a given population may be determined; apparatus for measuring the volume and rate of flow of water in a running stream, etc.

Here, as stated by Prof. Bovey, may also he seen the only standard cement testing department in Canada The visitors were shown an automatically working testing machine. Cement briquettes are placed in a copper vessel containing water and subjected to a temperature of 100 degrees. If, after 24 hours, the briquettes blow, they are given a second trial If, after the second trial, the briquettes blow they should be discarded. As in cement testing trouble often results from variation of personal manipulation, arrangements are being made in this department by which such manipulation will be done automatically

Other features of interest were the electrical department, which contains a 250 h. p. dynamo driven by a sixty h. p. engine There is not a belt in the place, the dynamo being driven straight on end. There are two engines each 500 h. p., and the space occupied by each engine is only 5x9 feet. The bottoms of the engine beds are hollowed out, which has the effect of preventing rocking.

One of the most interesting and valuable features of the institution is the library, which contains 6,000 volumes of scientific books, being one of the most complete libraries of its kind in the world

At the top of the building, enclosed in glass, is a museum of mechanical models, which for completeness is said to be unequalled anywhere in the world. These models are the work of a celebrated German maker named Releaux. and were many of them made expressly for this institution. They illustrate almost every conceivable mechanical movement, and will be of great service, not only to the students of the school, but also to manufacturers and inventors. They are valued commercially a $8,000. Between the School of Technology and the new Physics building, which was next visited, there is a vacant space on which Prof. Bovey expressed the hope that another building would shortly be erected. When asked if his expectation was that this new building would he devoted to architectural education, he replied in the affirmative. He pointed out that even at present accommodation exists in the Technological building for this purpose, and the hope was expressed that the architects might be able to induce some of their wealthy clients to make the endowment necessary for the equipment of a Department of Architecture.

The Physics building, which is as yet incomplete, seems likely to be as perfect in its arrangement and appointments as could be desired. There is also in course of erection a new library building with a capacity of 150,000 books. The college library at present numbers 30,000 volumes. The stack-room is to be made thoroughly fireproof. In addition to the ordinary reading-rooms, there will be special study rooms in the basement

Taking farewell of the college grounds and buildings, the party paid a visit to the new High School building, of which <person>Mr. Hutchison </person>is the architect. The front of the building is of pressed brick, and presents a very satisfactory appearance, while the planning of the interior appears to have been accomplished in an equally successful manner. The departments for the male and female pupils are at opposite ends of the building, with wide corridors between. Access is had to the lecture rooms from both departments. There are spacious play rooms in the basement, a library, a large gymnasium, and an assembly hall with a seating capacity of 1,200. The lighting facilities throughout the building are excellent.

From the High School the party returned to the Association rooms on St. James street.

It was moved by <person>J. J. Browne</person>, seconded by <person>F. X. Berlinquet</person>, that the Association tender its thanks to Principal Sir <person>William Dawson </person>for giving permission to the members to visit the new Science Buildings of McGill University, and also to the Dean and Professors of the Faculty of Science for their kindness in showing the members of the Association through the buildings.

It was moved by <person>J. F. Peachy</person>, seconded by <person>J. Venne</person>, that the thanks of the Association be tendered Mr. <person>J. R. Rhind </person>for his kindness in showing the members through the Victoria Hospital.

It was moved by <person>J. Nelson, </person>seconded by <person>C. Baillairg√© </person>that the thanks of the Association be tendered <person>Rev. Elson I. Rexford</person>, Rector of the <building>Montreal High School</building>, for his kindness in permitting the members to visit the new school and showing them through it.

The members then took leave of each other, and an occasion of much interest was brought to a close.





<article title="The Late W.H. Hodson" author="">THE LATE <person>W. H. HODSON</person>.

Mr. W. H. Hodson, one of Montreal's old time architects, has passed over to the majority, an acute attack of pneumonia having ended his useful career. He commenced the study of architecture with one of the best firms in Manchester, England. Completing his studies there, he emigrated to this country some







































time in the fifties, practicing with great success in New York and Brooklyn. Coming to Canada in 1857 or 1860, he located in Montreal, and probably first distinguished himself on the building occupying the north east corner of Bleury and Craig streets, amongst others carrying out the works successfully of Messrs <person>Owen McGarry</person>'s and <person>D. Ford</person>'s residences, <building>St. Ann's church </building>and <building>St. Finnis, Alexandria</building>. Mr. Hodson was a man of sterling qualities, his honesty being almost proverbial, his energy integrity lasting to the end.
