agent of strict integrity, and an inspector who thoroughly understands his business, the work and materials may be of a rather better class, but the work in the long run is certain to cost more. The same integrity and competence on the part of city officials should secure in the case of contract work practically as good a job at less expense, and without the same uncertainty as to ultimate cost. It might be a wise policy for the sake of good work to perform by day labor works costing not more than say $500, and which would not afford the cost of such inspection as would be necessary were they carried out by contract. The gist of the whole question may be summed up in this If the city is to get the worth of its money, either method requires honest and thoroughly competent supervision.





IN order to be able to present to our readers at the earliest possible date a report of the proceedings in connection with the third annual Convention of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, we have not only omitted much interesting matter intended for publication in this number, but have also increased the number of pages for this issue. The length of the report of the business transacted and of the remarks of the various speakers at the dinner makes it necessary to reserve publication of the several valuable papers read before the Convention, together with the discussions thereon, for a future issue. From the same cause we must postpone for the present any comments which might be suggested by the proceedings of the Convention., further than to express pleasure at the success which marked the occasion, and at the growing interest which manifests itself at each annual gathering. The Association has accomplished infinitely more during its brief existence than its most sanguine promoters could have hoped for, and bids fair to maintain an equal rate of progress for the future.

<article title=" PRESIDENT S ADDRESS." author="">PRESIDENT S ADDRESS.



GENTLEMEN,â€” In opening the proceedings of this third annual convention of the architects of Ontario, it is my pleasing duty to thank my fellow architects for the honor they have done me in granting this privilege, and especially because they have done this for so many times in succession.

On behalf of the architects of the city of Toronto, I have much pleasure in extending a most hearty welcome to our visitors from other parts of the Province. It is our earnest desire to make our Association provincial in the largest and best sense of that term, and feel confident that we will all be found working together with that end in view.

It gives me the liveliest satisfaction to be able to congratulate the architects of the Province on the success which has so far attended our efforts to promote professional and public interests by co-operation. And it may not be out of place just here to go back to the inception of our scheme for the formation of a professional association, and briefly outline its history from the very beginning.

A little over three years ago a few architects in this city met in the office of one of their number to discuss the project of forming a club or league, with a view to holding periodical meetings for the discussion of matters of common interest. They resolved to hold an adjourned meeting, to which others should be invited, and to dine together at the <building>Rossin House </building>as a means of promoting social intercourse. At that meeting, held on the 13th of October, 1887, was organized the <assoc>"Architects' Guild" of Toronto.

</assoc>The success of this city association during the years 1887-88 suggested to its members the feasibility of a provincial association, and a committee was appointed to look into the matter and take the necessary preliminary steps for the calling of a convention.

It is unnecessary that I should dwell on the success of that experiment. The convention was held at the <building>Queens Hotel </building>on the 21st of March, 1889, and the outcome was the formation of the provincial association and the adoption of a constitution. In November of the same year, a meeting of the new association was held for two days, and with it a very successful exhibition of architectural drawings. At this meeting the draft of an Act to incorporate the Society was approved of, and the Board of Directors were instructed to submit it to the Ontario Legislature and push it to a successful issue as speedily as possible.

This measure has as strong a basis in public utility as have any similar measures previously passed to incorporate other callings. The Law Society of Upper Canada is now a very venerable body, with a long, continuous and respectable career. The medical professions are incorporated as the <assoc>Ontario College of Physicians and Surgeons</assoc>, with its tariff of fees and tests of admission to the profession. The Provincial Land Surveyors are a very respectable and influential guild. Are not the architects equally a guild and equally respectable and influential? So at least thought the promoters of the measure. I might have added the dentists and druggists if it had been necessary to enforce my plea of justification.

The Legislature looked on our measure as a reasonable one. The Government framed the Act of Incorporation, introduced and passed it through its several stages as a Government measure. It received the Royal assent on the 7th of April, 1890, and was proclaimed in the Gazette on the following 25th of July. The first meeting of the Council of the Association under the Statute was held on the 6th of August last, and since then that body has not been idle. The By-laws for the government of the Association, the laws and regulations for directing the education of students and for the conduct of all examinations, are the result of their labors.

It is interesting to compare our rate of progress in this matter with that of our brethren in the Mother Country. There they have been talking of incorporation for upwards of thirty years, and have so far only reached the stage of framing a bill for submission to the House of Commons. The architects of Ontario, so far as I know, are the first in any country to secure legislative incorporation.

Some explanation maybe due to members regarding the change of time in calling the convention. The Council have, under the Act of Incorporation, the right to determine the time of meeting. We had the matter fully discussed, and it was the unanimous opinion of the whole Council that the early part of the year was the most convenient time for the profession generally. If this view commends itself to the Association this will continue for the future to be the regular time of meeting in annual convention and for the election of members of Council in the place of those who retire from office.

it is now my melancholy duty to remind you of the death of one of our most prominent members, the late <person>Geo. F. Durand</person>, of London. Mr. Durand stood deservedly high in his profession, and also with the general public in his own city. He took from the first a very active interest in the movement which resulted in the incorporation of this Association, and was President of our first Provincial Convention, and Vice-President until his death of the Association which was organized at that meeting. He took an active and useful part in the preparation of the draft Act of Incorporation, but did not live to see it even introduced into the Legislature. For myself, and I trust I may say for my fellow members, 1 take this opportunity of placing on record our deep sense of the great loss sustained by this Association and by the profession at large, in the death of one who was cut off in the very prime of life and apparently with a long, honorable and useful career before him.

The Association has also to mourn the loss of another member in the person of the late <person>Joseph Kilburn</person>, of Stratford, who died in the early part of the present year.

Permit me in closing to offer a few words of advice to my fellow members. We have a noble and honorable calling. On one side it is closely allied to or rather is a department of Art, which is the embodiment of the beautiful; on another side it is equally a department of Science, which is the co-operation of observed facts and phenomena under general laws or principles. It is our function on the one hand to promote the erection of beautiful as distinguished from unsightly buildings; it is equally our function on the other hand to see that the buildings put up are structurally secure and safeguarded from a sanitary point of view. On each side of our work it is capable of indefinite future development, and on each side it has an historical development. Every member of the Association who honors his calling and participates in its spirit should seek to equip himself for his work by careful preparation, and should keep his faculties on the alert for the reception of new ideas, both artistic and scientific. Fortunately for us it is possible to combine the useful and the beautiful often to the maximum extent of each, in the same structure, and to do this should be the conscientious aim and persistent effort of all.

To the younger members of our profession especially I appeal. Those of us who are older must soon pass away leaving to you the care which we now exercise over our common interests. Make up your minds to look more closely and successfully after those interests than we have been able to do, and above all things try to keep up a high corporate standard, by keeping the individual standard high. Do good work each in his own sphere.
