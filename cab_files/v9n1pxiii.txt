PERSONAL.

Mr. Charles Sproatt, late City Engineer of Toronto, and father of Mr. A. Sproalt, architect, of that city, died unexpectedly at his home in Innisfail, Alberta, N.W.T., on the 28th of December 

Mr. Henry Langley, of the architectural firm of Langley & Langley, Toronto, recently met with a serious accident. while engaged in superintending a building on Glen road, he fell between two joists, breaking his leg below the knee.



Mr. Geo. Browne, architect, of Winnipeg, is at present visiting in Ontario. He was so unfortunate as to have his library and other of his possessions burned in the fire which recently destroyed the Cauchon block. Having been absent from the city when the fire occurred, he escaped the horrible fate of sonic of the other occupants of the building, who lost their lives in the flames.



Mr. Adam Kaufman, of Baden, Out., a pupil of Mr. Melrose, for several years principal of the 6. T. R. art school at Stratford, Out., was awarded first prize for Architectural and Mechanical Drawing at the Industrial Exhibitions at To-. onto, London, Winnipeg and St. John N.B. since 1893 lie has been awarded 6 1st prizes, 6 medals and 23 diplomas. Mr. Kaufman is now at the head of the Baden art school.





Several New Brunswick parties are seeking incorporation as the Northumberland Stone Co., with a capital of $ 10, ooo.

A sand stone quarry has been discovered at Mill Cove, N.B. The stone is said to he well adapted for building purposes.



An effort is being made to reorganize the Hudson River Tunnel Co. and complete the work. Only 300 feet remain to he completed at the New York end, which $t,ooo,000 will complete, but $1,500,000 is required for the approaches. Probably the pro-posed bridge has prompted the movement to complete this hole in the ground, in which so much treasure has been sunk.



The Engineering News Publishing Co., of New York has favored us with a copy of a work issued by it, entitled "A text Book on Plain Lettering," by Prof. H. S. Jacoby, Associate Professor of Civil Engineering in Cornell University, The author has given a great deal of attention to his subject, and the book contains many hints that will be found useful to the engineer, the architect, and the draughtsman It is, we understand, the only work published on the subject. Price $3.
