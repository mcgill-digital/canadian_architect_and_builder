ARMOURED CEMENT.

<article title=" ARMOURED CEMENT " author="">

ARMOURED cement seems destined to play an important role in the twentieth century construction. The bold conception of building the new church, St. Jean de Montmartre, Paris, with this material will be a new departure in modern construction. No doubt the catastrophe at the Paris Exhibition, where this kind of cement was somewhat extensively employed, decided the public authorities to test the upper flooring of the edifice. The experiments were made on planking of five centimeters 1'965 in.) thick, which were charged to support a weight of 600 kilos. (1,322 lb.) to the square meter, that is to say, about four times the weight of a multitude of persons. Tests were placed in the crypt to register

the degrees of bending tinder the action of the deadâ€”weight The tests, after examination, did not show the slightest inflexion and the construction of the church will be completed. MM. Cottancin, engineer of arts and manufactures DeBaudot inspector-general of diocesan edifices, architect of the church, as well as the Abbe Sobaux, vicar of the new parish, and several engineers and architects were present at the trials, which were of the most minute description. 





The McClary Manufacturing Company, of London, are about to open a branch office at St. John, N.B., in charge of Mr. John Foot.
