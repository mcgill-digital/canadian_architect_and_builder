<article title=" GLASS BRICKS " author="">GLASS BRICKS.



<person>M. Jules Henrivaux</person>, who was formerly director of the great <building>French glass factory at Saint Gobain</building>, has become the advocate of a new building material, for which he anticipates sooner or later a prodigious demand. It is a brick made of what he calls stone-glass. The strength of it is not surpassed by any of the building stones, for it can sustain as much weight as a granite block. One of the stone-glass bricks has been found irresistible to blows with a hammer. Another advantage is that colours of all varieties can he imparted to the brick, and will enable it to be used for ornamental purposes. According to <person>M. Henrivaux</person>, glass can he employed in buildings from the foundations to the roof. Stone glass is also applicable to tubes for air, gas, electric wires, etc. It is needless to say the use of glass bricks has been recommended for many years, but it has never been attempted except on a limited scale. It is remarkable that, while glass is suggested to serve instead of stone and brick, thin stone has come into popularity in Germany as a substitute for glass in factory windows.



<article title=" A SUGGESTION FOR BUILDERS " author="">A SUGGESTION FOR BUILDERS.



An important contribution to building ideas has been made by Mr. <person>F. A. Talbot </person>when he asks, " Why should our suburban building plots be laid out in long, irregular, serried rows of houses ?" lie answers it by telling how two Burton architects have devised an

alternative, novel, and effective system." They urge that instead of being erected in streets, houses should be built round the sides of the particular plot, leaving the centre open, in much the same way as we lay out squares. The houses might be detached, semi detached, or built in blocks, and each should possess an individual design, so that a pleasing variety of styles of architecture might be obtained. It is also pointed out that this mode of building does not use up more land than building in rows, but that exactly the same number of houses of a given size can be erected on a certain plot as if they were laid out in streets in the orthodox fashion. The suggestion is one that not only the projectors of garden cities, but even enterprising suburban builders might experiment upon with advantage.





<article title=" A FORTY-ONE TON MONOLITH " author="">A FORTY-ONE TON MONOLITH.

The first of the eight large stone pillars that are to adorn the front on Chambers street side of the new hall of Records was placed in position recently. The monolith is 36 ft. long, 4 ft. 2 in. in diameter and weighs 41 tons.

The stone was brought here from Hallowell, Me., where it had to be trucked two miles to the railroad, put on a freight car, run to the Harlem River, transferred to a lighter and taken to pier "A". Here there was a delay of 24 hours in deciding whether the pier would stand the heavy weight. The monolith was finally landed successfully and was hauled to Chambers street by a score of horses. Every manhole on the way that the load passed over was cracked by its enormous weight. Two other attempts have been made to get the stone into position. Two engines, two booms, one of steel, and a double derrick had to be used to swing it on to its granite base.—Stone.

V.	City of TORONTO.—Judgment on appeal by defendants from judgment of <person>MacMahon, J.</person>, in favor of plaintiff in action tried at Toronto, brought by the widow and administratrix of <person>Levi Gaby</person>, late of Richmond Hill, deceased, to recover damages for injuries which caused his death. The trial Judge found after a lengthy review of the evidence that deceased left <building>the Commercial Hotel</building>, on Jarvis street, in the City of Toronto, on 19th November, 1900, at 8.30 p.m., in a sober condition, and that his body was found between 7 and 8 o'clock the next morning in a bole, 4½½ feet wide and nearly S feet deep, dug three weeks before by the contractor for masonry work of the new <building>St. Lawrence Market</building>, added as third party; that the hole was not properly guarded, and was sixteen feet clown from the building wail, and on the west side of Jarvis street, and deceased fell into it, and that tinder his contract with the defendants the third party, <person>James Crang</person>, was liable to them. Defendants' appeal dismissed with costs.

According to the contract form in general use, says <firm>the London Builders Reporter</firm>, the authority of the architect for the contractor to vary from the drawings or specifications is sufficiently proved by any writing or drawing given by him, or by any subsequent written approval by him. It, however, the architect certifies that a certain sum is due in respect of extras, though no order in writing as required by the contract has been given, the certificate is accepted by the Courts as a sufficient substitute. This fact has been again upheld in the case <person>Goodwin </person>v. <assoc>London Building Society</assoc>, which came before <person>Judge Mulholland</person> at Han-Icy. The plaintiff, a builder, brought the action to recover £38. 3s. 9d., balance of an account respecting a building contract. The London Building Society were the mortgages of <firm>Warwick Works</firm>, which the plaintiff had entered into a contract with thc executors of the late proprietor to restore after a fire. The con-tract price was £730, and the work was carried out under the direction of an architect. In accordance with the architect's certificate, the builder received payment in four instalments. which made a total of £710. The builder then claimed the hal-anee, viz., £20, and also £i8 3s. 9d. for extras. The architect testified to the work having been done satisfactorily, and that the extras had been executed by his instructions. The defendants maintained that they were not. liable for extras which had not been mentioned in the contract and they paid the £20 balance into Court. A verdict was given in favour of the plaintiff for £38 3s. 9d., the full amount of the claim.

We quote from the Scientific American of several years ago the following formulae for a fireproof dip for wood shingles:

Dissolve in a barrel of hot water 20 pounds of zinc sulphate, 20 pounds of powdered alum, 8 pounds of caustic potash, 8 pounds of oxide of manganese, and add 8 pounds of oil of vitriol. Pack the shingles loosely into another barrel and till up with the liquid, keeping the shingles under the mixture by means of a weighted cover. Fill the first barrel also with shingles, and allow them to soak for several hours, then take them out and pile away to dry. Repeat this operation until all the shingles are impregnated with the mixture. Use rubber gloves for handling the shingles, and when laid on the roof coat them with a suitable oxide of iron paint.

<article title=" WHITEWASH FOR OUTSIDE WALLS " author="">WHITEWASH FOR OUTSIDE WALLS.—For this purpose The Irish Builder recommends the following :—Take half a bushel of good unslacked lime, and slake it with boiling water covering it during the process to keep in the steam. Strain the liquor through a fine sieve or strainer, and add to it a peck of clean salt previously dissolved in warm water ; 3 lb. of good rice, ground to a thin paste and stirred in while boiling hot ; ½ lb. of powdered Spanish whiting, and lb. of clean glue, previously dissolved. Add gal. of hot water to the mixture, stir well, and allow to stand for a few days, covered from dirt. Thc whitewash should be put on quite hot. A pint of this mixture will cover a square yard upon the outside of a house if properly applied, and will retain its brilliancy for years. The growth of lichen is an indication that the roughcast contains too much moisture. A wash with a dilute solution of sulphuric acid might kill the growth and would not injure the wall ; but probably a more permanent cure would he to give a coat of fluate, or any of the other soluble silicates made for the purpose.
