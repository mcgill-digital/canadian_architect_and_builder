Clause 10 to the end of the act deals with provisions for legal proceedings. They give the Division Court and City Magistrate jurisdiction in matters relating to the payment of wages, and

On the 8th inst. a deputation from the <assoc>Toronto Builders' Exchange</assoc>, consisting of Messrs. <person>John Aldridge</person>, <person>David Williams</person>,

<person>M. Murphy</person>, <person>William Park</person>, <person>William Pears</person>, <person>George Moir</person>, <person>M. Vokes </person>and <person>James Tennant</person>, with Messrs. <person>G. Ritchie </person>and <person>Frank Denton </person>as legal advisers, waited upon the Ontario Government with regard to the above act. The deputation was introduced <person>by D. Gilmour</person>, M.P.P., anti received by Sir Oliver Mowat, Hon. <person>A. S. hardy</person>, <person>C. F. Fraser</person>, <person>John Dryden </person>and <person>G. W. Ross</person>. Mr. Pears, President of the Exchange, in speaking on behalf of the delegation, said that the bill as it stood would adversely affect legitimate business to a greater degree than it would remedy an injustice supposed to exist affecting wage-earners. He referred to certain amendments which the association he represented desired to see made to the bill before it became law, and said as regards section t he thought it should read so as to apply to the same parties mentioned in Section 4 of tire Mechanics' Lien Act viz every mechanic, machinist, builder, miner laborer, contractor, or other persons doing work upon or furnishing materials to be used in the construction of a building. He considered the supply merchant had as much right to be protected from devices to defeat payment for materials as workmen for their wages. Section 2 he found no fault with, but section 3 he considered embodied the chief weak point of the bill. It was almost impracticable, and should be struck out as absolutely unnecessary, while section 6 remained. It did not even reach the parties it was intended to, and would greatly hamper the business of a legitimate builder He believed that any workman who had lost wages could show that it was nut because the contractor had received his money and had not pail miff his workmen, but because the latter had not been able to get his money from the building owner, and the section would not reach this man. These were the cases where workmen lost their wages, or when the builder and owner were the same person. He could honestly say he hail never heard of a man not being paid by a contractor when the contractor had received what was due to him. Section 4 was considered just but section 5 should include the same parties suggested for section 1. He would also propose that the percentage retained on a contract should be applied to the liquidation of liens before being used for completing the building. The objects which it was hoped section 3 would attain he thought, as already suggested, would be amply provided for by section 6, and therefore this and the following section should stand while section 3 should he expunged. With regard 10 section 8, he considered an amendment should he added to the effect that the value of improvements referred to should he estimated at 50 per cent. of their actual cost ; thus while 50 per cent, would go to the mortgages there would be also 50 pet cent. of their value available to satisfy any existing liens upon the building With regard to the jurisdiction of matters under tire act, he thought that the Division Court should be the legal tribunal for liens, even those now provided for in the High Courts by the " Mechanics' Lien Act," and ire asked that the Bill be allowed to cover this ground In conclusion he wished it to be understood that the object of the delegation was not to prevent justice being done to the wage-earner but that both classes should be placed on a fair and equal footing in their business connection.

Mr. John Aldridge also pointed out that section 3 which was aimed at speculative builders, would not touch that class to any extent, as such men were generally building owner and builder combined. If the clause was allowed to stand as at present it would only be the means of hampering the work of legitimate contractors. He doubted very much whether it would be possible to produce receipts for all wages paid, as they were not always obtainable.

Sir Oliver Mowat asked if this clause would meet the views of the deputation if it was altered sir as simply to provide for the production of an affidavit when an advance was required declaring that all wages due say a fortnight previous to that (late had been paid.

Mr. Aldridge in reply thought that the trade would be satisfied with any arrangement as long as they were not hampered in their business, but as the clause would not reach the parties Intended he did not see the necessity of it being in the Act.

Mr. Ritchie strongly urged that in clause it should be made quite clear that lien holders had to be satisfied before any of the percentage held by the building owner could be devoted to completing the building.

Sir Oliver Mowat thought the clause was clear on that point.

Mr. Ritchie also drew attention to the fact that no provision was made in cases where a builder purchased land simply on the terms of a building agreement. He therefore suggested a clause should be inserted to the following effect "In case a purchaser of any land shall make default in carrying mint the terms of an agreement for the purchase thereof a lien shall not be defeated by such default, butt shall he attached to the estate or interest of the person to whom the land shall revert by reason

of such default." He also thought that claims tinder the lien laws for wages and materials should be transferred to the Division Court from the higher Courts, as he had often found it

his experience that costs prevented the bringing of actions for

small amounts	 Mr. <person>Denton</person> agreed that clause 6 in the Act accomplished all
