fling from end to end and dividing the beam practically into four sections. Beam 33 was water-soaked and hard-frozen when tested. It was of exceptionally good quality, free from shakes, and had clear, straight grain. Beam 39 was cut out of beam 33 after the latter had been tested.

In the transverse experiments the greatest possible care was taken to increase the load at the same uniform rate, the average time occupied in adding each increment and in taking the corresponding reading being slightly' greater than one minute. In many cases the beam was loaded, then reliever1 of load, and reloaded again, the readings in all eases being carefully noted. This operation was sometimes repeated more than once. Whenever a beam or a specimen under tension or compression was subjected to repeated loadings, the first series of readings were almost invariably discarded as the increments of deflection, and changes of length were found to he more uniform after the preliminary loading. The initial loading seems to eliminate certain inequalities of resistance.

In beam 15 there was an increment of .401 inches in the deflection, corresponding to an increment of 7,000 lbs. in the load. On reducing the load to 500 lbs., there was an apparent set of .006 inches, which would have undoubtedly disappeared in a short time. Upon reloading the beam the increment of deflection for the same increment of load was .4 inch. In beam 17 the increments of deflection under the first and second loadings were exactly the same, viz., .415 inch for an increment of 7,000 lbs. in the load. When the load, after the first series of readings, was reduced to 500 lbs., there was an apparent set of .005 inch, which would have certainly disappeared had the beam been allowed to rest for a few minutes. In beam 24 (spruce), for an increment of 6,000 lbs. in the load the increment of deflection was 1.04 inch in the first loading and 1.034 inch in the second. Upon being entirely relieved of bar1, there was an apparent, but evidently only apparent, set of .01 inch. In beans 25 (hemlock), for an increment of 6,000 lbs. in the load, the increment of deflection was 1. 165 inch in the first loading and 1.155 inch in the second, the apparent set when entirely relieved of load being .01 inch. In beam 27 (spruce), after being loaded and this entirely relieved of load, there was an apparent set of .005, which in two hours had fallen to .002 inch. In beam 26 (hemlock), after being loaded and then entirely relieved of load, there was an apparent set of .004 inch which had entirely disappeared after an interval of about two hours.

In the case of beam 28 (white pine), there were three sets of loadings, the increments of deflection corresponding to an increment of 1 2,000 lbs. in the load being .238 inch and .234 inch for the first set, .237 inch and .232 inch for the second set, .237 inch and .232 inch for the third set.

When the beam was entirely relieved of load after the first set, there was an apparent set of .002 inch, which had entirely disappeared in 25 minutes. The second set of loadings commenced after an interval of 18 hours. The mean increment of deflection =.2344 inch the mean compression .0827 inch, and, using the ordinary formula, the corresponding value of E= 1,066,980 lbs.

The increments of deflection for repeated loadings corresponding to an increment of 6,ooo lbs. in the load were .675 inch, .660 inch, .65o inch for beam 29 (hemlock), 335 inch, .330 inch, .337 inch for beam 30 (spruce), .492 inch, .485 inch, .487 inch for beam 31 (red pine), .675 inch, .655 inch, 653 inch for beam 32 (white pine), .313 inch, .305 inch, 305 inch for beam 49 (red pine).

The increments of deflection for repeated loadings, corresponding to an increment of 7,000 lbs. in the load, were .625 inch, .620 inch, .620 inch, .623 inch for beam 33 (spruce). The increments of deflection for repeated loadings, corresponding to an increment of 5,000 lbs. in the load, were : .590 inch, .556 inch, .555 inch for beam (hemlock).

For beams dried at 212 F., the increments of deflection for repeated loadings were: .420 inch, .400 inch, .405 inch, .405 inch, .405 inch for beam, 36 (white pine), and an increment of 6,000 lbs. . 178 inch, .

inch, .173 inch, for beam 37 (red pine), and an increment of 4,000 lbs. .039 inch, .042 inch, .040 inch, .040. inch, for beam 38 (white pine), and an increment of 300 lbs. .048 inch, .048 inch, .048 inch, .049 inch for beam 39 (spruce), and an increment of 300 lbs. .071 inch, .070 inch, .070 inch, .070 inch for beam 40 (hemlock), and an increment of 300 lbs. .363 lbs. .358 inch, .358 inch, .363 inch for beam 41 (red pine), and an increment of 1,200 lbs. .669 inch, .672 inch, .675 inch for beam 42 (white pine), and an increment of 1,200 lbs. .411 inch, .416 inch, .408 inch, .402 inch for beam 43 (white pine), and an increment of 6,ooo lbs. .243 inch, .240 inch, .238 inch, .241 inch for beam 44 (red pine) and an increment of 6,000 lbs.

From these results and from the further observations up to the point of fracture, the following inferences may at once be drawn : (a) The increment of deflection diminishes and therefore the coefficient of elasticity increases with the elimination of the moisture from the beam. (Is) The increments of deflection are much more uniform in amount in the case of kiln-dried beams.

It is, of course, impossible to maintain a beam in a kiln-dried state. As soon as it is exposed to the atmosphere, it at once commences to absorb moisture, and the absorption continues until there is an equilibrium between the hygrometric conditions of the beam and atmosphere. The beam is then in its normal state, and the experiments indicate that the increassents of deflection, corresponding to this state, are approximately uniform. The rate of absorption depends essentially upon the nature of the timber, and proceeds more slowly as the density increases. The weight of a central 2-inch slab of beam 30 (spruce), increased 3.6 per cent. in 24 days, and 8.5 per cent. in 47 days. The influence of moisture on the deflection of a beam was well illustrated in the case of 15 inch x 6 inch Douglas fir beam on i86 inch centres. On June  15th, 1895, it was placed in position and was loaded wills a weight of 1,000 lbs. at the centre, producing a deflection of .071 inch. The daily observations, extending over several months, showed a continually increasing deflection, until, by the evaporation of the moisture, the beam had attained its normal state. The average deflection now remained constant, varying, for example, between .09 inch on August 24th, and .082 inch on September 2nd, the greater deflection of course corresponding to an increase of moisture in the atmosphere. On the 4th of September the load was increased to 2,000 lbs., which produced a deflection of. 127 inch. This load remained on the beam until January 8th, 1896, the reflection during the same period varying between . 129 inch and . 114 inch.

Of 20 non-kiln dried beams, 11 failed by crippling on the compression side, failed by longitudinal shear, and 3 hemlock beams only failed by the fracture on the tension side. The experiments on the direct tensile and compressive strength of the timbers show that this is precisely what might be expected to take place. In every case the direct tensile strength is very much greater than the direct compressive strength, and failure by crippling is likely to take place under a load much less than the material could bear in tension. Under all circumstances, therefore, in practice, it is advisable to place a beam so that the portion of the timber which is strongest and in the best condition should be in compression. Again, the experiments conclusively show that kiln-drying enormously increases the direct compressive strength, ho greatly diminishes the shearing strength, while the direct tensile strength does not appear to be as such affected, although in the majority of cases it was diminished and sometimes considerably. The large increase of strength in compression due to kiln-drying might have teen naturally expected, as in the process of drying the walls of the cells are stiffened and hardened, and thus become better able to resist a compressive force. The walls, however, are at the same time much more brittle, and it is possible that a sudden blow might cause the failure of a kiln-tried column. which would have remained uninjured had the moisture seit been eliminated. It may also be of interest to some that in the re-tests of specimens after the injured portion had been removed, the compressive strength was, almost without exception, increased. Hence, by kiln-drying a beam its compressive strength is made to approximate more closely to its tensile strength, and its transverse strength is consequently sometimes considerably increased. It must be remembered, however, that this kiln-drying invariably largely diminishes the shearing strength, and therefore proportionately increases the tendency to shear longitudinally. Thus, of the isine kiln-dried beams in the preceding tables, only one failed by crippling while femur failed by fracture in the tensile side and four failed by longitudinal shear. Indeed, generally' speaking, kiln-dried beams will fail either by a tensile fracture or by a longitudinal shear, and this result has been further verified by experiments subsequent to those referred to us the present paper

In practice, of course, beams cannot be maintained in a kiln-dried state, but they rapidly' pass into the normal state. Time question of how far it is desirable to eliminate the moisture depends essentially on the balance to be maintained between the tensile, shearing and compressive strengths, and a beam should always be placed so as to exert its relative strength to the best advantage. Kiln-drying, unless some special method of prevention is adopted, develops shakes in the tinsller and causes existing shakes to become more pronounced. Some of these shakes often extend to a great depth, and run the whole length of the beam, so that it not infrequently happens that only a slight layer is left to hold the beam together. Such a beam, although otherwise sound and clear, offers very little resistance to longitudinal shear, and might mire justly be regarded as being made up of two or more superposed beams.





PLUMBING IN OTTAWA,

THE Master Plumbers and Plumbers' Union of Ottawa have appointed a committee to interview the Council and learn why the plumbing by-law passed in 1893 has not been enforced. The by-law calls upon every master plumber to take out a license at $2 per year, and to give a bond of $200 its a guarantee of good work; the license fee for journeymen plumbers is 25 cents. It is claimed that the health of the citizens has suffered because of defective plumbing work done by incompetent and irresponsible firms, and the Council will be urged to enforce the law for the future, and to incorporate in it a provision that iron pipe in houses should be carried through the foundation and protected by a stone arch, so that when the foundation sets the drain still remains unimpaired.





WAXING FLOORS.

AN excellent method for waxing floors is as follows Take a pound of the best bees wax, cut it up into very small pieces and let it thoroughly dissolve in three pints of spirits of turpentine, stirring occasionally, if necessary. The mixture should only be a trifle thicker than the clear turpentine. Apply it with a rag to the surface of the floor, which must be perfectly clean. This is the most difficult part of the work ; for, if too much or too little is put on, a good polish is impossible. The right amount varies, less being required for a hard, closegrained wood, and more if the wood is soft and opengrained. It is best to try a foot or two of the floor before going over the whole. Put on what may be considered enough and leave the spot untouched and unstepped on for twenty-four hours, or longer if needful. When thoroughly dry, rub with a hand brush. If it polishes well, repeat the process over the whole floor. If it does not, remove the wax with fine sand paper and try again, using more or less than before, as may be necessary and continue experimenting until the desired result is secured. If the mixture is slow in drying, add one part japan to six of turpentine.
