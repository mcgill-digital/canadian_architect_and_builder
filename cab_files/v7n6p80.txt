WITHIN the last few years Austrian engineers have been adopting various systems of combination iron and concrete arch floor construction in buildings where the floors are subjected to heavy loads, with a considerable reduction in cost and a great gain in the rapidity of construction over the old form of brick arch construction. For some years the Monier system, illustrated and described in Engineering News of May 23, 1891, afl(l Feb. 16, 1893, has been most generally specified for floors, but recently two other systems, the Wuensch and Melan, have been very successfully used in a number of large buildings. The application of these two systems to actual structures is shown in the accompanying illustrations

FIG. TRANSVERSE SECTION OF BREWERY AT BUDAPEST,

SHOWING WUENSCH SYSTEM OF IRON AND CONCRETE FLOOR CONSTRUCTION.



In Fig. is shown the construction of the Wuensch system as used in the floors of a large brewery at Budapest, Hungary. In this building the second floor had to be designed for a lOa(1 of 240 lbs. per sq. ft., and the third floor for a 80 lbs. per sq. ft. load. The space to I)e covered was 174 X 52 1/2 ft. Two rows of columns were run lengthwise of the building i8 ft. apart and 16 ft. from the side walls of the building, and upon these was placed the system of concrete and iron arches shown in the illustration (Fig. 1). As will he seen, this system consists of a series of arches spanning the spaces between columns lengthwise of the building, and these arches carry other arches which span the space transversely. The longitudinal arches act simply as girders which support the arches forming the floor proper and are only 15 3/4 ins, wide, 14 ft. span and 1.4 feet rise. They are made up of four 2.16 X 2. 16 X 0.28 in. angles, two of which are curved to form a bottom chord, so to speak, for tension, and two of which form a horizontal top chord for compression, and are filled in with concrete. It will be seen that the system is simply a modified form of tile Monier system, in which the wire nettings are replaced by stiff angle or T-sections.

The tranverse arches are constructed in exactly the same manner as the longitudinal arches, except of course that they form continuous vaults the entire length of the building and use

T-sections instead of angles for the iron skeleton. Two of these arched vaults have spans of i6 ft. and one a span of i8 ft. and the iron frames are placed 7.9 in. apart for the second floor and 13 ins, apart for the third floor. The T-sections used are i x x

0.15	in. The composition of concrete was cement, 2~' sand and 3~' broken stor,e.

The time taken to construct this iThor with 8,5oo sq. ft. of area was four days: the centers weie allowed to stand one 'veek after the concrete had been placed. Mr. Schustler, the designer, works out the cost of the floor, as compared with a floor consisting of twelve 14-ft. span brick arches laid between I-beam girders

supported on cast iron columns (a design which was at first proposed for the work) as follows

Mr. Scliustler further states that the saving in cost over brick aiches in this floor was 30<. It is to be remembered, however, that this Statement aI)plieS to

tlie cost of materials and labor in hungary. The high price for 1;ibor in this country would make the saving considerably less.

ConsiSts in embedding curved

I-beams in concrete and has proved very strong under he:tvy loads. The illustrations, F4~s. 2 and 3, show the system as appUed to the floor of the spinning-~oorn of a large factory at Tetsclien, in Austria. This floor has an area of about 40,000 sq. ft., and is loaded with heavy spinning machinery. As will be seen the concrete is filled in bet~veen the beams, coming down belo~v the concave flange of the curved I-beam and being level with the tipper flange of the arch. A poorer quality of concrete is generally used for the spandrels and ashes are used for fillini,.. The connection of the curved I-beams at the floor girders is shown in Fig. 3, where it will be seen that simply a couple of wedges are used, there being no riveting of any sort.

The manner df laying the concrete is first to build a centerini~ with tight lagging conforming to the intrados of the arch. The manner of constructing the centeriiig is shown in the accompanying sketch, Fig. 5. The iron frames are theii placed rind the concrete rammed in place in layers, as is also shown in L.ig 5. In this manner a gang of 14 men have laid from 700 to 8oo sq. ft. of floor in a day of ten hours, including the spandrel filling of poorer concrete which, of course, h ad to be laid separately. This gang consisted of four men placing the I-beams, fastening them rind placing the centering one man for sand and one for cement four men mixing the concrete ; two men carrying the concrete and two ramming it into place.

this gang the amount of concrete laid per hour per man was 2 cii. ft. This record is low, however, and on bridgework the average amount of concrete laid is 5 cu. ft. per man per hour.

In hg. 2 it will he seen that a tie-rod has been used in the arches abutting against the wall. Usually the stiffness of the I-beams is sufficient to prevent any movement without these. The arrangement of the I-beams and the depths of the concrete for (lifferent span arches are shown in the accompanying table

For smaller spans than 10 ft. T-iron instead of I-beams will be used. In conclusion, it may be of interest to mention some

tests recently made by the Austrian

Society of Civil Engineers and Architects  to determine the comparative strength  of (lifferent systems of concrete arch  floor construction. The Wuensch sys 3.28 tern was not included in these tests,

 but other tests made by the Hungarian Cross Section Government show it to be far superior



CONSTRUCTION	to the Monier system. These tests may be tabulated as follows

		Brick	Concrete.	M onier.	Melan.

	Span	 I31/2	131/2	131/2	13 1/2

	Rise	15 3/4	15 3/4

	Lbs. iron used per sq. ft		. .	8

	Breaking load, lbs. per sq. ft	321 1/2	737	839	3,360



We are informed that in practice the relative strengths of the several arches when all are made of equal thickness are as follows: Brick arch, i concrete arch, 5; Monier arch, i6; Melan arch, 36. On the other hand, the relative thickness of different arches of the same strength would be: Brick arch, 12 inss.; concrete arch, ins.; Monier arch, 3 ins.; Melan arch, 2 ins
