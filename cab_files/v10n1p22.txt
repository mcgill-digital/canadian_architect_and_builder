large staff of men, and calling for clear-headed superintendence.

The latest addition is the agency of the <firm>Boston Blower Co.</firm>'s Canadian business in heating of large buildings















































and the fitting up of stock conveyors for cotton, wool, and other mills.

Among the business men of Montreal Mr. Reed stands in the front rank of those whose business lives have done much to elevate the standard of business integrity in the community.

MR. <person>JOHN McLEAN</person>



commenced business in Montreal as an ornamental plasterer in the year 1870, and for the last quarter of a century has been closely identified with this and other branches of ornamental work in connection with most of the important buildings erected in that city during that period. Mr. McLean has established an excellent















































reputation for thorough, conscientious and skilful work in this and other allied branches of the building trade. The first terra-cotta fireproofing work for division walls, ceilings and roof construction in Canada was put in by him as contractor during the erection of the fine building of the New York Life Insurance Company on Place d'Armes, Montreal. Again, under the direction of Mr. <person>A. T. Taylor</person>, F.R.I.B.A., he was in the van-being first to lay marble mosaic floorsâ€”-the first in Canada being put down in the banking room of the Bank of Montreal.

MR. <person>W. P. SCOTT</person>



represents a familiar figure in the building trade of Montreal, and but few in the trade have had a more marked success than he. Mr. Scott is a true Scotchman by birth, being a native of Edinburgh. Landing in New York, he pursued his trade with the leading de

signers and decorators of that city, and being possessed of considerable talent as an artist, and the indomitable push characteristic of the Scotch, has gained for himself a wide reputation as a designer and decorator.

Mr. Scott arrived in Montreal about 20 years ago and opened business on his own account, and from that time he began to step the ladder of success, and is now at the head of his profession in Montreal.

Mr. Scott is of a quiet, genial disposition, and possessed of a considerable amount of patience and the















































power to please, backed up by talent as an artist, and to these characteristics is largely due his success.

Among the large public buildings of Montreal there are many which bear witness to his skill.

MR. <person>J. H HUTCHISON</person>,



who occupies the foremost rank as a masonry contractor, commenced business about 25 years ago, his first contract being the casing of the post office building at Portland, Maine. After a residence of three years in Portland Mr. Hutchison returned to Montreal, and in connection with Mr. Daniel Wilson built the Windsor Hotel. On the completion of this work he again engaged in business on his own account. He built the <building>Redpath Museum</building>, and also constructed the first ice palace in Montreal. Mr. Hutchison's yards, situated

















































on Seminary street, cover an area of 4,000 square feet. He owns an extensive machinery plant operated by steam, and gives employment to a large number of workmen. Among the important buildings which he has erected may be mentioned the Redpath Museum, <building>Temple Building</building>, <building>Board of Trade,</building> High School, St. James and Erskine churches, Queen's Hotel, and the residences of <person>Lord Mount Stephen</person>, <person>Sir Donald Smith</person>, <person>R.
