SPENCE



"DAISY" HOT WATER HEATER





Still Acknowledged to be the best in the market.









Be not deceived

the "Daisy" is no experiment; it has been thoroughly tested during the past



 six years. There are thousands in use and all giving satisfaction. There is no other in the market with the same record.

Imitation is the best proof



of excellence.









Its construction

is unexcelled, its circulation perfect. The only boiler that can be repaired without disturbing the piping. It does the best work in any position. Heats on its own level.
