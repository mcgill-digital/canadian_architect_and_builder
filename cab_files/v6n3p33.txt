THE celebration of the two-hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the city of Montreal is to take place on June 24th and four following days. The inauguration of the <building>National Monument Building </building>on St. Lawrence Main street will take place on that occasion.



We hope it will not be regarded as a reflection upon the work of Hamilton plasterers that the vibration caused by the running of the trolley cars through the streets is said to have caused the plaster to fall off the walls of the buildings of that city.



MR<person>. T. C. Keefer</person>, the celebrated engineer, who was the Canadian Commissioner at the Paris Exposition, thinks that a very striking exhibit of Canadian Engineering as manifested in the great public works of Canada, should be shown at the Columbian Exhibition at Chicago.



IN this age of keen competition it is refreshing to come across a trade that needs not to advertise, but is advertised for. Mr. <person>George Johnson</person>, Dominion statistician, of Ottawa, has received a letter from Georgetown, Demerara, asking for the names of firms able to supply ready-made houses. If any of our readers are able to fill such orders, they may, by communicating with Mr. Johnson, find an opening for doing business in this line. 



THE designs submitted in the final competition for the proposed Government buildings at Victoria, B. C., have been forwarded to Montreal, where they were examined by the experts, Messrs. <person>Curry</person> and <person>Taylor</person>. Mr. Curry has gone to Victoria, taking with him the drawings. After conferring with the commissioner of Lands and Works, of British Columbia, the final decision of the competition will be made. We hope to be able to publish full particulars regarding the result in our April issue.

Much interest has been awakened by the publication in the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER for February of the results of the series of tests of building stones conducted at the School of Science, Toronto, under the direction of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>. The tests included samples of both native and foreign stones. The excellent showing made by the former should be a matter of satisfaction to the quarry owners, and to architects and builders desirous of assisting to develop Canadian resources by using native material whenever its quality can be shown to be equal to that of foreign productions.



OUR esteemed Indianapolis contemporary, Stone, discusses in a recent issue the subject of continental union, and reaches the conclusion that such a union would mean to the United States "a distinct commercial gain unequalled in the annals of the world." Following this comes the somewhat paradoxical statement that "it would be better that formal action be taken first by Canada, the country really most interested." In other words Canadians
