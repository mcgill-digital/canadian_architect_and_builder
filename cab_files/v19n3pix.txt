" author="">SELECTION OF PORTLAND CEMENT TO BE

USED IN CONCRETE BLOCKS.

Mr. <person>R.K. Mead </person>of East Nazareth, Pa., recently read a paper on this subject before the National Association of Cement Users of the United States. After showing the importance the bearing of the class of buildings now constructed of concrete blocks would have upon the industry in the next generation, he stated that all Portland cements were by no means good cements and that Portland cement being improperly made would undoubtedly constitute one of the greatest reasons for concrete block failure. He stated that the manufacture of concrete blocks needed a very fine cement and that it should he one which would give the block good color and requisite strength. He stated if the block

manufacturer allowed his warehouse to become the dumping ground for cement rejected for the heavy rough undertakings, he could never expect to get out a high class product. The all important qualities, he said, that cement should possess, to be adapted for use in the manufacture of concrete blocks, are 1st, endurance ; 2nd, strength ; 3rd, color. He then went on to show the importance of the property of endurance, and showed how that many cements, because of improper mixture, not enough burning, shipped too green, not ground fine enough, would cause the block to expand and eventually disintegrate. He said that such a class of product was by no means unknown in the United States, and that oftentimes cement rejected for large undertakings was dumped on the block manu
