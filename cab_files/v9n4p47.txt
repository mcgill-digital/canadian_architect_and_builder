AT the last session of the Legislatures The Lien Laws. of Ontario and Quebec important

amendments to the lien laws of those provinces were adopted. At the request of some of our subscribers, and to give every reader an opportunity of becoming familiar with the present existing laws, we devote considerable space in this number to the publication in full of the Ontario Lien Act of 1896, and amendments to the Auge Bill in the Province of Quebec.



By the death of Lord Leighton, Eng. The Late Lord land has lost one of her greatest artists

Leighton.

and art critics. Lord Frederick was perhaps the greatest authority on the law of Harmony while alive, and his sudden taking off will be a severe loss to the whole art world. Since Ruskin has ceased to be an active factor, no man's opinion on art or its productions have been read with such deference as those given out by Leighton. He was an authority on everything he deigned to discuss.



THE introduction of brick of different Color in Brickwork, shades, and terra-cotta, in domestic

architecture, is an innovation that is to be commended if not carried beyond the limits of good taste. Fine soft effects may be obtained by a proper interweaving of different shades of bricks from the same yard, if care is taken in choosing the pattern and selecting the bricks. This sort of work, however, should only be undertaken by persons thoroughly conversant with the law of color harmony, as in unskillful hands the commingling of color would be as likely to prove disappointing as otherwise. The practice of mixing red bricks with cream-colored ones, or vice versa, is one that should be discouraged, unless the work has been designed by an architect whose good taste is beyond reproach. Many buildings in towns, villages and country in Ontario are discords in red and cream and sometimes, in red, cream and black, with facades like immense checker boards, or covered with sheets of the Cameron tartan. We have in our mind's eye a block of stores in a northern town, well adapted for the purpose for which they were built, faultless in construction and arrangement, and modern in all their fitments, but lamentably ugly on the front exterior, partly from faulty design, but chiefly because of the use of multi-colored bricks being employed for decorative purposes over the windows and in the cornices, over-profusely, and apparently without regard to law and order.
