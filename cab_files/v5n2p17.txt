his plans traced and used in similar buildings. He thought it was a matter which the Council should consider, and hoped for

definite action.

	<person>Mr. Curry </person>stated tile motion to be that the Council should  take such action as they might deem necessary to protect architects' plans, specifications and details from improper use. This was put to the meeting and carried.

1r. Gordon mentioned that there was an instruction to the Council to prepare a blank form of certificate at the last session : he was not sure whether it was in the minutes or not, as he was not present when they were read. <person>Mr. Langton </person>explained that

it did not appear in the minutes because the discussion came to nothing ; as there was no motion carried it was not put in the minutes at all.

Mr. Curry reminded the Association that they had two members of the Quebec Association present, and thought it would be well to hear from them as to what could be done to bring the

F.	Associations closer together. He first called on <person>Mr. Hutchison </person>to give some information with regard to the position of the Quebec Association.



Mr. Hutchison, who was received with applause, assured the members that it gave him great pleasure to meet with this Association. The Ontario Association was the first to draft a charter from the Provincial Government, and this fact encouraged them to try to obtain a charter from the Quebec Government The Quebec ( Government had followed pretty closely the example of the Ontario Government, so that the charter of the Quebec Association contained very much the same provisions as that of the Ontario Association. In the matter of a tariff for professional services in Quebec, they were formula ting a tariff which is to be submitted to the Governor-General in Council ; and after it gels his approval, it becomes tile legal scale of charges. Their Council had taken the matter up and, after a great deal of trouble, prepared a tariff of charges which they submitted to the Quebec Government some months ago but the recent trouble in the Government had prevented the completion of the matter. Before this trouble arose, when they were before the Government, the question was asked, " Has the Ontario Government sanctioned a tariff of charges for the Ontario Association ?" They were under the impression that it had clone so, and said so. This they had afterwards to correct. So it was evident that the Quebec Government were following very much in the wake of the Ontario Government in dealing with the architects, so that a great deal would depend, as far as the Quebec Association obtaining Governmental assistance is concerned, upon what the Ontario Association obtained from their Government. There seemed to he a feeling that they would not be behind in this matter. He thought that the two Associations could work together very advantageously in the matter of obtaining the imposition of a tariff upon plans coming into this country from the United States. He looked forward with a great deal of hope to the assistance that the Quebec Association would receive from the Ontario Association in this and other matters. He had great hope that the formation of these two Associations would elevate the standard of the profession generally (Hear, hear.) This would he a matter of slow growth; but as they compel young men who enter the profession to show a high standard of education, there was no doubt that, in thc course of a few years, they would certainly elevate tile tone of the whole profession. So far as it was in the power of an individual member of the Association he intended to do his utmost at all times to raise the standard to the very highest. (Applause.) They had difficulties to contend with in Quebec that perhaps there would not be in this Association. They had the dual language, though he had to say their French architectural friends had shown a great deal of interest in the Association, and he hoped they would continue to do so. He was sorry that no member of the Quebec Association had time to prepare a paper to he read at this meeting, hut he could give a practical talk on the application of ventilation to hospital buildings. (Hear, hear, and applause.)

The Chairman then introduced to the meeting, <person>Mr. Clift</person>, Sec. of the Quebec Association, who assured the convention they did not know what pleasure it gave him to be with them. He wished that more of the Quebec members had been present. The Quebec Association had only been in existence about two years, and so had not got so many members as the Ontario Association ; there were only some seventy architects qualified and a good number of students. When they saw that an Association was being formed in Ontario, it began to be talked about by the architects in Montreal whether they could not do like wise, and bye and bye they succeeded. He took the opportunity to thank the officers and members of the Ontario Association for the assistance they had rendered him in his official capacity; they had always been willing to give him any help needed. lie was sure the Council and members of the Quebec Association were heartily thankful for the assistance rendered. Mr. Clift then advocated the desirability of forming a joint association for the Dominion, with headquarters in Toronto, and local associations with officers and powers as at present. He knew it was the feeling of a great many architects in the Quebec Association, and thought the sooner it was clone the better. He did not think it would be a difficult matter ; provincial charters had been obtained, and a Dominion charter would be given almost as a matter of course.

The Chairman expressed the pleasure the members of the Ontario Association felt in listening to Messrs. Hutchison and Clift. With reference to the proposed Dominion Association, the Chairman thought it unwise to pledge themselves to any definite action, but thought the Association would second any efforts made by the Quebec Association.

Mr. Clift desired to move a resolution, and on being assured that members of the Quebec Association were expected and had the right to take part in the proceedings of the Ontario Association, he suggested that the two Councils should form a commit-tee to consider the probability of forming a Dominion Association.

The Chairman thought the better way would be, as the idea originated with the Quebec Association, that they should have the privilege of taking the first step.

Mr. Hutchison stated in reply to an enquiry by <person>Mr. Bousfield </person>that all that his Council could do would he to consult about the matter and arrange preliminaries it would take an annual meeting to perfect the details.

Mr. Bousfield supported the proposition, but the chairman (Mr. Curry) thought it would be as well to allow this matter to stand for a while, so that it might be discussed thoroughly. There was just one thing against it at the present time ; he thought it would be better to perfect the Provincial Associations, both Ontario and Quebec, and get them running in good shape, or they would be trying to cover too much ground. They certainly looked forward to a Dominion Association, but it would he better to bring to perfection the Provincial Associations first

<person>Mr. Jarvis </person>brought up the question of having as a building inspector a properly qualified architect, one who could see in a moment the merits and demerits of a set of plans, and who could readily notice points in construction.

<person>Mr. Gouinlock </person>did not think that this was a matter for the Association, as it concerned only the Toronto architects, and further consideration was postponed.

No further business being offered, the Chairman announced the election of three members to the Council, and suggested Messrs. Hutchison and as scrutineers, which proposition was received by the Association with applause. Mr. Frank Darling, and Mr. Fuller, of Ottawa—the latter at the request of Mr. Billings —and <person>Mr. Lennox </person>had their names withdrawn as candidates.

While the ballots were being counted, Mr. Gordon moved that it be an instruction to the Council for this coming year that they consider the advisability of formulating a blank certificate for the general use of the profession.. No action was taken in this matter by the Association.

Mr. Bousfield moved a vote of thanks to the retiring President, Mr. <person>W. G. Storm</person>, for the trouble he had taken during his three years of office ; lie had not spared time or money in his efforts for the good of the Association. He understood that Mr. Storm, under the constitution, could not be ejected President for two consecutive terms, and, as he had now finished his first year since reorganization, although the third in point of fact, he was obliged to vacate the chair ; Mr. Bousfield considered this all the greater reason why they should tender him a hearty vote of thanks.

<person>Mr. Power</person>, of Kingston, seconded the motion.

The Chairman, in putting the question, which was unanimously carried, stated that lie believed a great deal of the success of the Association was due to Mr. Storm's efforts. As Mr. Storm was not present, it was arranged to formally present the thanks of the Association to him at the banquet in the evening.

Upon motion by <person>Mr. Dick</person>, seconded by <person>Mr. Darling</person>, a vote of thanks was passed to the Minister of Education, the Hon. <person>Mr. Ross</person>, for his interest in the Association, and to <person>Prof. Galbraith </person>and <person>Mr. Wright </person>for their assistance.

The Registrar also received the thanks of the Association.

Mr. Hutchison and Mr. Clift then announced the result of the election as follows : There were thirty votes cast ; Messrs. <person>King Arnoldi</person>, <person>Edmund Burke </person>and <person>John Belcher </person>have a majority of all the votes cast. (Applause.)

At the suggestion of <person>Mr. Gregg</person>, the Chairman thanked Messrs. Hutchison and Clift for their attendance at this meeting.

THE BANQUET.



On Wednesday evening a banquet was given by the Toronto members to the visitors from a distance. About seventy persons were present. Mr. W. G. Storm, President of the Association presided. With him at the head of the table were Mr. A. C. Hutchison and Mr. C. Clift, of Montreal, representing the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc> ; Mr. <person>Emerson Coatsworth, jr</person>., M.P. for East Toronto; Prof. Galbraith, of the School of Practical Science Mr. <person>Kivas Tully</person>, Architect Public Works Dept., of Ontario; Mr. <person>Jas. Bain</person>, Public Librarian, and others.

The menu was of excellent character, superior in fact to that of the previous year. After proper attention had been bestowed upon it, the President arose and in a few appropriate words proposed the first toast, " The Queen," which was heartily responded to by all present singing "God Save the Queen," followed by three hearty cheers.

Our Sister Society of Quebec, with whom we wish always to remain on the same friendly terms as at present," coupled with it
