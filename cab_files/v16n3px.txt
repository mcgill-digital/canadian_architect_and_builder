A novel idea in building has been carried out by Messrs. Carrere and Hastings, the architects of the new building now being erected on the site of the disused reservoir in Bryant Park for the <building>New York Public Library</building>. This is the erection of a portion of the main front in plaster, in the full size of the original. While architects are accustomed to execute the most elaborate work from drawings, and models are employed for sculptural and ornamental details, it is seldom that so large and costly a model is made as in this case, where an entire bay, with windows, inclosing columns and roof balustrade, has been built up in full size on a portion of the actual site. The model is supported in position by the scaffolding for the actual building and the framework of the derricks from which the masonry and bricks will be lifted into position.
