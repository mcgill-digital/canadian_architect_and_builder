PLANT.

The City of Chatham has the distinction of being the first in Canada to install a central heating plant. The system is steam, installed by the <firm>American District Steam Company</firm>, of Lockport, N. V., as an adjunct to the Electric Railway Company. Thc exhaust steam from the power house is used for the heating plant, and the shareholders of the heating company are the shareholders of the railroad.

Although new in this county, there is no reason for predicting anything but success for the system. The installing company have already over two hundred systems of the kind in successful operation in the United States. The waste by the non-use of exhaust steam in large works must he enormous, since nearly 90 per cent. of the steam generated is discharged. A heating system of this kind is therefore a true economy; and when run in conjunction with power works of sufficient magnitude, its success seems guaranteed. In other respects the advantage is obvious. To turn on heat as one does light, without having any of the encumbrance, labour, dirt or danger of its generation on the premises, is a decided advance in the art of comfortable living. We shall doubtless

see a large extension of the application of this system in towns that have grown up to the railway point and are not within reach of water power.

The essential condition of successful heating, where the steam in conveyed so long a distance, (there are 4,300 feet of main supply pipe in Chatham,) is an insulation of the pipe that will allow the steam to deliver to the customer as nearly as possible all the thermal units it contains when it leaves the central station. The insulation adopted by the American District Steam Company is a tin-lined wood casing, having a shell 4 inches in thickness, with an air space between the casing and the asbestos covered pipe, which is inserted therein. This casing is made of white pine staves, tongued and grooved, and bound together with heavy galvanized steel wire wound spirally. Thc surface is then covered with asphaltum and sawdust. With this covering the steam is said to be carried long distances with very slight loss from condensation. The pipes are all laid to a grade to prevent any accumulation of water from this cause.

It is necessary also to provide for pipe expansion by joints that will require no packing or other attention after the pipe is once installed. This is taken care of by a patented device which takes up expansion, with-
