<article title="Proper Size of Pipe for Greenhouse Heating" author="">PROPER SIZE OF PIPE FOR GREENHOUSE HEATING.

<person>J. D. CARMODY </person>of Evansville, Ind., has published a treatise on heating of Green Houses by the hot water

system, illustrated with engravings, in which are full directions how to locate the pipes, put them together, make the joints, mend leaks, and all necessary instructions. From this treatise we quote some useful instructions on the proper size of pipe for green house heating, in which the advantages and disadvantages of large and small pipe are considered.

Large pipe, say 4-inch, commonly used in connection with water heating, contains a large quantity of water, (about one gallon to the foot,) and for a line of 1,000 feet or more, it will require a long time to heat, but it possesses the corresponding advantage of retaining heat much longer after the fire dies out. Two inch pipe has one-half the heating surface of 4-inch pipe, but it holds only 1/4 the amount of water contained in the same length of 4-inch pipe ; consequently the same fire in the same sized boiler will heat the water in 1/4 the time, or will impart 4 times the heat in the same time where 2-inch pipe is used instead of 4-inch.

It will not be necessary to have double the amount of 2-inch pipe when used instead of 4-inch, because the water being decreased in quantity, will be much hotter. To substitute 2-inch pipe for 4-inch, add one-half to the length required of 4-inch,

EXAMPLE :—If you require 1,000 feet 4-inch pipe to heat a house you will need 1,500 feet of 2-inch for the same purpose. T he use of 2-inch pipe results in economy of fuel, but as small pipe cools off quicker closer attention must be paid to the fire.

One advantage in favor of wrought 2-inch pipe is, it can be put in at less expense, and is stronger than the cast iron 4-inch pipe.

Where the pressure system is used, wrought iron pipe only will be safe ; the size may be from t-inch to 2 inches, according to locality.

The drawback in the use of wrought pipe by florists, who generally put in their own pipe, is the cutting and threading; this requires expensive tools that only pipe fitters have, while cast pipe can be put in by common labor, if printed directions are followed.
