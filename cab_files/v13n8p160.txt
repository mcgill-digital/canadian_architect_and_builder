<article title="Visit of the London Builders to Cleveland" author="">VISIT OF THE LONDON BUILDERS TO

CLEVELAND.

WE are indebted t Mr. Geo. 8. Gould, secretary of the London Builders' Exchange, for the following interesting account of the recent visit of the members to Cleveland, as the guests of the Cleveland Exchange.

Last year the Builder's Exchange of Cleveland held an excursion to Port Stanley. The London Exchange invited them to London for noon-day lunch and a drive through the city, and then returned with them to Port for the balance of the day, where they gave us a splendid afternoon's sport, and a banquet in the evening at the Fraser House. The only amends we could make at that time was to give them a lesson in the art of base hall. They demanded satisfaction, and obtained from us a promise to visit them this year, so on the 24th of July last about 70 of our members with 6o ladies left Port Stanley at 11 p.m. on the steamer Urania for Cleveland, arriving there the next morning at 6 a.m. Their committee met us at the wharf and escorted our party to the Weddell House for breakfast. From there we visited their Exchange rooms in the Chamber of Commerce building, where they occupy the whole of the third floor, and have utilized every inch to the best advantage. For Exchange purposes it would be simply impossible to improve their lay out or furnishing. There need be no delay in reaching their rooms, as they have four elevators, and in a very few seconds you are landed in their corridor; from there you obtain entrance into the main room. This immense floor space is divided into sections, large or small as desired, and rented to manufacturers, who place their wares there as exhibits, and architects and proprietors make a practice of coming there and making their selections for building purposes. Here we have sample brick of all kinds as well as laid up work, terra cotta, beautiful displays of marbles, fancy iron work, builders' hardware, wood mantels, grills, parquet floors, etc., in fact there is almost everything to be found there that is used in the construction and ornamentation of buildings. There are also a number of small spaces rented by the members and fitted up by them as offices where they transact their business during the day. They have also private rooms where plans are figured on, consulting room, a board room, president's private office, secretaries' office, lavatories and telephone room. They keep two secretaries permanently employed, and a page boy in livery. On the ground floor of the building is a large auditorium where they hold their banquets. After we had inspected the rooms and registered they placed us on cars for a trip to one of their parks about 9 miles east. On our return to the rooms again we were tendered a formal reception and luncheon by the Exchange. At I p.m. we all took cars again for Scenic Park, where a programme of sports was participated in by the members of the two Exchanges. We would like to forget all about the baseball match, butâ€”--well, they had their revenge. the tug of war heavy team they won. The tug of war light team we won, and the rest of the honors were about evenly divided.

The Cleveland Builders' Exchange Committee consisted of Arthur Bradley, W. J. Warden, XV. B. Green, C. C. Duschel, W. H. Gick.

The London Exchange Committee was composed of:

Samuel Stevely, chairman ; Thos. Jones, secretary Ed. Martyn, John Hutkins, H. Stratfold, Win. Smith, Geo. Everett and the President.

On returning to the city we were taken to the Hotel Stilson, where a sumptuous banquet had been prepared. About 300 sat down at the well filled tables. Between the courses several patriotic and other songs were ably rendered by Ruthven McDonald, of London. After ample justice had been done to the viands the acting president of the Cleveland Exchange who was in the chair, in introducing an appropriate toast list, gave expression to the great pleasure afforded their Exchange in meeting so many of the London members and their ladies in Cleveland.

When the London Builders' Exchange was toasted, Mr. Samuel Stevely, chairman of the general committee, called Mr. Arthur Bradley, past-president of the Cleveland Exchange, and Mr. Win. Tytler, president of the London Exchange, to the front, and in an appropriate speech presented them each with a handsome gold medal, the gift of ex-mayor J. D. Wilson. of London, (who was unavoidably detained from being present) given as souvenirs of the very pleasant reunions held in Canada last year and in Cleveland this year. The recipients feelingly responded. After the postmaster of Cleveland had responded to the toast of the ladies in a glowing tribute to their worth, we had to retire in haste as the boat was waiting. So terminated one of the pleasantest days' outing we have ever enjoyed. Accompanying our party as the guests of the Cleveland Exchange were the Mayor and Col. Culver, the U. S. consul of this city, and Ald. McCulloch, of St. Thomas.
