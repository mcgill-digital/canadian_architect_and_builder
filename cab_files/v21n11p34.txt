GALT EXPANDED STEEL LATH

















This Lath has been, and is being, very extensively used in the United States by the foremost Architects and the largest Plaster Contractors.

The sheets are very flat, and are even and square on edges and ends; this means quick and easy application.

The greatest width of metal is horizontal; this means a rigid plastering surface, combined with great economy of material.
