THE PERSPECTIVE PROCESS.

On first learning the meaning of a picture, it would naturally

strike the mind, says the Illustrated Carpenter and Builder, that a sure and easy method of carrying any point from its position in space to its position in the picture would give anyone the power of drawing the outline required. Such a process might be laborious, but it would put the whole design within possible reach. This method would be an excellent one for learners to begin with, previously to entering on the use of vanishing points; it would l)e something like learning to count with pebbles before entering on the common rules of arithmetic. Even without diagrams it may lie possible to give such a description of the process as will enable some who have never attempted anything before to put a few simple figures into perspective. Let the picture plane, which suppose transparent, be spread out before the spectator, teaching down to the ground, and bounded on the right by a side wall, which extends both before and behind

it.	Every point which is to be drawn has a point directly below it on the ground, which call its ground-point ; and a point directly opposite on the side wall, which call its side point. All the ground points make, when properly jointed, what the architect calls a plan all the side points are elevation. The picture would be called a section if points were taken on it opposite to the points to be represented; instead of this a point is carried to its place on the picture along a line drawn to a certain point in front of the picture, which represents the eye of the spectator.

This eve-point has also its ground point and its side-point. The picture has its ground line and its side line, and every point in the picture has its ground-point upon the ground-line and its side point upon the side line. A picture-point is known when we know where the ground-point s by its distance from the side line, and where the side-point is by its distance from the ground line. To lay down a given point on the picture, draw a line from its ground-point to the ground point of the eye ; that line meets the ground-line of the picture in the ground point of the picture point required. In the last sentence for ground read side, and we see how to find the side point of the picture point in the side line of the picture. Two lines being drawn on a paper perpendicular to one another, the right side of the paper may represent the side wall laid flat on the ground by turning round its ground line, and the left side may represent the ground plane. The two sides of the line which separates the upper part of the paper from the lower represent the ground line and side line of the picture. Take another paper, or another part of the same paper, draw two perpendicular lines, lay down the ground and side picture points by taking their distances from the paper on which they have been found, and the points of the picture may at once be put in their places. This is an explanation of the principle of a picture and an exhibition of a sufficient method of construction that is of sufficient power, but not of sufficient facility; every point requires the drawing of three lines.
