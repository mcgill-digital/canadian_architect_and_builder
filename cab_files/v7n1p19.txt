<article title=" THE "EMPIRE" SCROLL SAW " author="">THE "EMPIRE" SCROLL SAW.

This machine is designed for carpenters, builders, cabinet makers and general workshop use ; it is thoroughly practical, strong and durable, will Cut up to 3 inches thick, and swing 24 inches.

It has wooden arms operating upon an entirely new principle being pivoted in such a manner as to do away with any side motion, and in connection with the self adjusting saw clamps gives a straight up-and-down motion of the saw blade.

It is arranged to use regularly, 8-inch saw blades, but can be adjusted to use 5 inch blades for very light work, if desired. It has an iron tilting table turned true and polished, which can be changed to any angle for sawing inlaid work. It has an adjustable upright drilling attachment, provided with an "Empire" drill chuck, which will hold from No. 6o to 3-16 inch twist drills. The driving wheel is 24 inches in diameter and the driving belt being the patent V shape, strong power s obtained without any sipping or lost motion.

The foot power has a walking motion, by which much power can be obtained with little fatigue, and it enables the operator to run the machine

with both feet, sitting; or one foot, standing, as desired.

The average rate of speed when sawing is about 800 strokes per minute. The height

of 



For steam power,

tight and loose pulleys, arranged to connect with the driving wheel

shaft, are furnished.

<article title=" CASTING PLATE GLASS " author="">CASTING PLATE GLASS. 

The casting tables, the most important

hearing, for the rollers



thickness of the plate	

of glass to be cast. The rough plate is THE commonly nine sixteenths of an inch in thickness ; after polishing it is reduced to six or seven sixteenths. The casting-tables are mounted on wheels, and run on a track that reaches every furnace and annealing oven in the building. The table having been wheeled as near as possible to the melting-furnace, the pot of molten glass is lifted by means of a crane, and its contents quickly poured on the table. The heavy iron roller is then passed from end to end spreading the glass into a layer of uniform thickness. The whole operation of casting scarcely occupies more time than it takes to describe it Each movement is made with almost nervous rapidity. Few industries offer such fine scenic display as the pouring of molten glass. One feels like crying "encore!" t is so very brilliant. In contact with the cold metal of the table the glass cools rapidly. As soon as possible the door of the annealing-oven is opened, and the plate of glass introduced. The floor of the oven is on the same level as the casting-table so that the transfer can be conveniently and quickly made. When, after several days the glass is taken out of the oven, its surface s found to be decidedly rough and uneven. A small quantity is used in this condition for skylights and other purposes where strength is required without transparency. It is known in the market as rough plate The greater part of the glass, however, s ground, smoothed and polished before it leaves the establishment.

<article title=" FIREPROOF CONSTRUCTION " author="">FIREPROOF CONSTRUCTION.*

In a thoroughly fireproof building it is not alone necessary that the materials of construction should be incombustible and covered with burned clay. (1 The clay used in the manufacture of the fireproofing material must be of a certain kind. (2) The forms of the pieces and the method of putting t together and securing it in place must be based on scientific principles and the experience of those who have studied tile subject.

The clay must he of the refractorv kind. That is, it must be either a plastic fireclay, a semi-fireclay, or a fireclay mixed with a plastic clay or shale. The best fireclays are too "short" for this purpose and too brittle if highly burned. In the manufacture of porous terra cotta very few clays  have been found that are both practicable for making a good article and able to resist fire when in use. So far as I know they have only been found in three places Brazil, Indiana, Chaska, Minnesota, near Minneapolis, St. Paul ; and in some parts of eastern New Jersey. For the manufacture of hard fireclay material, proper clay can be found in many localities. The best I know of are in Utica and Ottawa, Illinois St. Louis, Missouri ; and

the eastern clay belt of Ohio, where they exist in the greatest quantities. They are

Scroll	Saw	specifications the requirements of mechanical expedients or fastenings, with iron straps and bolts where they might best he avoided, and too much of the same in practice. It is too often forgotten that it is useless to employ for fastenings the same material that we are trying to protect. As a general principle where metallic fastenings or hangers are necessary they should always be either concealed within the fireclay or covered with mortar. All suspended fire-proofing should 

be secured from the back or edges. As an illustration, the common form of roofing with T irons and book tyles is not a fireproof construction, and will sag and fall from slight exposure to fire on the other side, though thoroughly fireproof on the upper surface. c. It should not be used unless protected by a suspended fireproof ceiling, all communication with the intervening space being permanently cut off. As a further illustration, all girder covering supported by straps or bands on the outside is useless, and all wooden blocks built into fire proof materials should be avoided.





<firm>The Toronto Steel Clad Bath Co</firm>. have issued a supplement to their catalogue in which they call attention to their steel clad bath No. 2, and to the fact that after the 1st of May next they will decorate all steel clad baths in light green enamel, with the standard relieved in gold, without extra charge.
