The best of the Taj is that however and whenever one views it, it never seems to lose its freshness, its fantastic beauty. Enter the great stone portal set in the walls that surround the tomb, and you step from the blazing, dust choked atmosphere of the world into a green, cool garden. You may sit within a shaded

arbor before a shrub-dotted lawn and watch the white-robed natives moving noiselessly along the double path that leads to your fairy palace, its dome rising, a great white, blazing hemisphere into an azure sky, and its four slender guardian minarets at the four corners of the pedestal on which it stands.

Then as the afternoon wears on and the dome begins to shade half white, and pink evening clouds float by lazily, you join the white-robed natives and move with them slowly along the walk toward the Taj, listening to their low voiced salutations and the splashing of numberless little fountain jets. The white of the marble is softened now and takes a faintly yellow tinge, and as you draw closer, what from the distance seems smooth, untouched marble is in reality intricately inlaid in graceful scroll-like patterns over door and archway, all done in semi-precious stones. Truly the "Pathans designed like Titans and finished like jewelers."â€”
