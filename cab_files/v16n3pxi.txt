The question is being seriously discussed in Athens of reconstructing the ancient Temple of Erechtheus, in Athens. The "Asty" states that most of the broken fragments of the entablature lie littered about the ground, together with great slabs of marble, which, if replaced in position, would again give visitors some idea of the beauty of the temple as it originally stood.
