and read by Messrs. <person>Hutchison</person>, <person>Doran </person>and <person>Haynes</person> The Council regret that the opportunities thus afforded the members for meeting together were not taken as full advantage of as they might nave been, but hope that the new Council will afford such opportunities during the ensuing year, that the members will take full advantage of them.

With a view to afford student associates opportunities of advancing their studies in Architecture, lectures were delivered weekly for three months on the styles of Architecture, and a class for the study of pen and ink drawing was formed These lectures and classes were not as largely attended as was expected, but as the formation of these classes last winter was somewhat of an experiment. the Council hope that if the lectures and classes are continued during the ensuing winter months, that students will fully appreciate the facilities of study thus afforded them

The Council regret the delay that has taken place in the printing of the By-laws and Act of Incorporation, hut as a copy has now been furnished to each member, the want of them which may have been felt has been removed.

The tariff of professional charges and practice prepared by the preceding Council in conformity with the Act and presented to His Honor the Lieutenant Governor in Council for ratification was, owing to the change which took place in the Government of the Province last February, left in abeyance, and as your Council did not consider the time opportune to present it to the new Government immediately after their accession to office. they did not do so until after the close of the session in the meantime another clause was added fixing the charge for valuations of property The tariff as amended was laid before the Government on the first opportunity that presented itself, and its ratification was personally requested by the members of the Council who waited upon the members of the cabinet. Since then a correspondence has taken place with the Honorable Provincial Secretary respecting the tariff of charges and professional practice of architects in the United States and in Europe, and it is hoped that a confirmation of our tariff will soon be reached.

During the last session of the Legislature a Bill was introduced providing for the granting of certain privileges to contractors, architects, workmen, and parties furnishing materials for building As the privileges to architects provided for in the Bill had not been asked for, and are considered unnecessary by the Council, several members of the Government were rummunicated with and requested to prevent the Bill from becoming law, it was, however, withdrawn, before discussion upon it took place.

When the office of Sanitary Inspector became vacant by the decease of the late occupant, your Council addressed the city council requesting them to make the salary attached to the office sufficient to secure the services of a thoroughly competent sanitary engineer, and to only appoint one who was thoroughly qualified.

In response to an invitation from the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>to attend their annual meeting and dinner last February, Messrs. <person>Clift </person>and <person>Hutchison</person> on behalf of the Council attended and conveyed its greetings

During the last session of the Dominion Parliament a deputation from the Ontario Association waited upon the Government to urge upon them the enforcement of the Customs Tariff on plans prepared in the United States and sent into Canada. Your Council appointed a deputation to support the Ontario Association in bringing the matter before the Government

Your Council regret to record the decease of two members of the Association since our last annual meeting, namely Mr. <person>W. T. Thomas</person>, in June, and Mr. <person>W H.

Mr. Taylor desired to thank those who had assisted the Hanging Committee by sending examples of their work. He hoped that their example would be followed by others, and that members would also be found willing to present to the Association architectural books, which would form the nucleus of an instructive library. A vote of thanks to the Hanging Committee was moved by Mr. Brown, seconded by Mr. Rhind, and adopted.

AFTERNOON SESSION.

Mr. Victor Roy, the newly-elected President, called the convention to order and announced that five papers were to be read, the first of which, by <person>Eric Mann</person>, was entitled "Classic Architecture in Relation to Detail, with a Few Notes on Construction in Building."

Mr. Mann explained that the paper he was about to read was originally prepared to be read before the students, and was only presented to the Association owing to his having been unable to prepare something more suitable.

The paper, which is one of especial interest to students of architecture, is printed elsewhere in this number.

Mr. <person>Chas Baillairgé </person>followed with a paper on "Escape from Buildings in case of fire."

Mr. <person>A. T. Taylor </person>presented a paper on "The Relation and Application of the Sister Arts, Painting, Sculpture, to Architecture," <person>Mr. Rhind </person>a paper on "The Architect as a Business

Man and Artist," and Mr. Hutchison a paper on "The Plenum System of Ventilation as Applied to the New Surgical Buildings of the Montreal General Hospital, the latter being illustrated by a large diagram.

The President expressed satisfaction with the character of the papers to which they had just listened, and suggested that great benefit would result if monthly meetings of the Association could be arranged.

Mr. Hutchison said that such meetings were not a success last year, but he hoped it would be possible to do better in future. Personally, he would be pleased to contribute for the general benefit of the members any points of interest arising out of his experience.

Mr. Brown expressed a desire to see a spirit of greater fellowship prevailing among the members, and an indication of the determination of the Association to fulfil the objects of its existence.

Mr. Taylor having called the attention of the President to the presence of Mr. Curry, President of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, an invitation was extended to that gentleman to address the meeting.

Mr. Curry, after expressing the pleasure with which he had listened to the lectures, said that one of the greatest drawbacks to the progress of the Ontario Association, and he supposed of this Association also, was the apathy on the part of the members. With a membership of nearly 150 in the Ontario Association, and of nearly 70 in Toronto alone, only about 35 were usually in attendance on the meetings. The reason was, that members placed their personal business first, instead of the interest of the Association. He commended the plan adopted by the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Guild</assoc>, the members of which once a month go direct from their offices and dine together at a restaurant, and there discuss in an informal way matters of interest to the profession. The guild was very exclusive, admitting to its membership only desirable men and such as would attend the meetings. Those who failed to attend were dropped from membership. The organization had done much to promote friendship in the profession. The formation of a Dominion Association had been mooted, but he advised that they should endeavor to make a thorough success of the Provincial Associations before attempting the larger undertaking. Unfortunately some members of the Ontario Association, instead of seeking to assist the Association to elevate the standard of the profession, were seemingly only anxious to know what personal benefit was likely to accrue to themselves in return for their fees. These members took is wrong view of the subject. Notwithstanding, from their standpoint even, there were benefits to be derived The Association library might be pointed to as one such benefit, and one which could be made of increasing value. The test of native building stones recently conducted by the Association was also of decided value to architects. In conclusion, the speaker remarked that goodfellowship and a desire to promote the good of the profession would best promote the success of the Associations.



THE BANQUET.



In the evening a considerable proportion of the members of the Association with a number of invited guests, pertook of a banquet at the City Club.

The toasts of Her Majesty, the Queen, and the Lieutenant Governor of the Province of Quebec having been duly honored, letters of regret at not being able to be present, were read from the Hon. Messrs. <person>DeBoucherville</person>, <person>Beaubien, </person><person>Flynn</person>, <person>Pelletier, </person><person>Hall</person>, <person>Taillon, </person><person>Casgrain</person>, and <person>Nantel. </person>Letters of regret had also been received from the members of the Council of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, the President of which, Mr. Curry, was, however, present. The Secretary was sorry he had had no reply from the <assoc>Canadian Society of Civil Engineers</assoc>.

The Chairman : "Gentlemen, I have much pleasure in proposing the toast of "The Corporation of Montreal," represented here to-night by our worthy Mayor. It would be superfluous for me to try to speak in favor of the Mayor, for the simple reason that you know him better than I do, I hope he will give a few words of encouragement to this new Association."

The toast was drunk with enthusiasm.

The Mayor. "Mr. President and Gentlemen, I can assure you that I feel proud to be called 10 respond to the toast of the City and members of the Corporation. First, let me say that I had the honor to be a member of the Provincial Parliament when I think your Association was inaugurated by a charter, which with the assistance of the members for the City of Quebec, we succeeded in having granted. It is a satisfaction to reflect that our action in this regard has borne good fruit. The charter given to your Corporation has in the city of Montreal at least, chartered a body of men whose architectural skill excites the admiration of visitors to our city. It is the practice of some to borrow architectural talent from the other side ; but let me say I have erected some buildings, and I always employ a resident architect. (Cheers). I can say as much on behalf of the gentlemen from Quebec. Montreal owes its great position to-day, as far as buildings are concerned, to the men I see around me, who have erected those noble buildings that are the pride of our city. As far as the Mayor is concerned, he may be only a cipher and figurehead ; but let me tell you that the corporation, with all their faults, are trying to make Montreal a place to be admired. Sometimes we may be reproached with
