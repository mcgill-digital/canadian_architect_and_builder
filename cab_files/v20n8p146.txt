ENLARGEMENT OF BRITISH MUSEUM.

King Edward laid the foundation stone of the important additions to be made to the British Museum with elaborate ceremonies, the other day. Part of the new work has been done already, and when the whole has been finished the proportions of the structure will be much more commodious than at present. But the present extension is only a step toward the completion of the perfected plan, which, according to the existing designs, will finally cover a square area of thirteen acres. The cost of the present improvements will be about $1,000,000. The new buildings, which are in the rear of the old structure, consist of a basement and sub-basement which will afford large storage space for printed and other material.

Higher still will be a floor devoted to various studies and to students' rooms, and over all 380 feet of galleries in which the Egyptian and other collections will be displayed. Mr. J. J. Burnet, of Glasgow, is the architect. King Edward has been a trustee of the Museum for many years, and has proved his active interest in the institution in many ways.â€”New York 'Evening Post."
