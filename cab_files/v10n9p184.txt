A SUBSCRIBER at Gait writes: Could you let me know how to make a good red stain for brick. I want to color a building of white common brick. If you can give me a recipe that is known to have given good results, I shall feel obliged.

ANSWER.---- Slake one-half bushel of lime in a tight barrel by pouring over it sufficient boiling water to cover it four or five inches deep, stirring it until slaked. Then fill the barrel two-thirds full of water and add a bushel of best Owen Sound Portland cement. To this add 3 lbs. sulfate of zinc, previously dissolved in water. Color with Indian red to suit. If this is too dark use Venetian red. A clean coal oil barrel will answer. If a painful of clean fine sand is mixed with these materials and kept well afloat while using, the work will be much improved. Apply with a flat brush. Be careful not to splash stone or woodwork, for when dry it is next to impossible to remove. This mixture,

when properly applied, renders the brickwork impervious to damp.



A new window frame carries a rod at one side on which the window is hung to swing- outward as well as slide up and down.

In painting brickwork it is of great importance to see that the bricks are thoroughly dry, and they should, therefore, not be touched after a storm or heavy rain. The best time to paint this class of work is in a hot summer. These remarks apply equally to stonework.

PREPARING ZINC FOR PAINTING. -—-Dissolve in 64 parts of water 1 part each of chloride of copper, nitrate of copper and sal ammoniac ; then add 1 part of commercial hydrochloric acid. Brush the zinc over with this mixture, which gives a deep black. Leave it to dry for twenty-four hours, when any oil color will firmly adhere to it, and withstand both heat and damp.
