<article title=" LESSONS OF THE PARK AVENUE HOTEL FIRE " author="">LESSONS OF THE PARK AVENUE HOTEL FIRE.

The recent fire in the <building>Park Avenue Hotel, New York</building>, caused but little damage to the building, which proved to he a good example of fireproof construction. The floors were of iron and brick, the partitions of brick and the elevators and stairways enclosed in brick walls. The fire was confined to the main hall. A sad feature of the occurrence, however, is the fact that several persons were snffocated by the smoke which entered their rooms from the halls and stairways through the crevices around the transoms and doorways. This is a new phase of the fireproofing problem to which attention must be given in the future.



<article title=" MOUNT ROYAL CREMATORIUM " author="">MOUNT ROYAL CREMATORIUM.



<building>The Mount Royal Crematorium, Montreal</building>, built from the designs and under the superintendence of <person>Andrew T. Taylor</person>, F. R. 1. B. A., architect, Montreal, is now completed. So far as known this is the first building of the kind to be erected in Canada. The crematorium is situated to the left of the entrance of Mount Royal Cemetery.

The gateway and the porch lead to a large conservatory hall, about 81 x42 feet inside. The conservatory will serve a double purpose. It will be used as a waiting- hall for the crematorium, and also for the winter vaults, which are located beyond. From this conservatory a door leads into an ante-room, from which another leads into the crematorium proper. This latter consists of two portions, a waiting hail and a chamber in which thc incinerators are placed. The conservatory has a high glass roof, with ornamental iron trusses, and a floor of mosaic marble, and will be kept well filled with flowers. The crematorium proper is lined with marble. It has an arched roof and windows, fitted with leaded lights. A portion of

of it is lined with white tiles. The idea is to make the whole pleasing and attractive without extravagance or over ornamentation.

The style of the building is Gothic. Montreal limestone is used for the walls. The doors are of oak. The conservatory has large plate glass windows. The building will be heated by hot water pipes. The incinerators are of the most modern arrangement. Room for four incinerators have been allowed, but two only are built at present.

The Inland Architect has commenced the publication of a series of notes by architects in general practice in the United States, showing the cost per cubic foot of different kinds of buildings. Messrs <firm>Jenney and Mundie</firm> report the cost of a number of fire proof buildings in which iron and steel construction was employed. The figures cover a wide range from 7 4-10 cents per cubic foot for a warehouse and manufacturing building, and 10 1-5 cents for stables, to 17 1-5 cents for an apartment building and 20 cents to 57¼ cents for office buildings.
