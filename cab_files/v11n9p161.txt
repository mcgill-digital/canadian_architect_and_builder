VIEW OF THE CORNWALL BRIDGE DISASTER.



THE CORNWALL BRIDGE DISASTER.



THE accompanying illustrations show the character of the international bridge at Cornwall, two spans and one pier of which suddenly failed on the 6th inst., resulting in the death of fourteen workmen and injury to many others. The pier successfully resisted during last winter the current and ice shoves, and the false work was being removed from the superstructure when the accident occurred, so that the whole structure appears to have been practically completed, though not taken off the contractors' hands,

Several theories are advanced regarding to the cause of the failure, but we prefer not to speculate on this important feature of the case, but to await the result of the investigation which is now being made by Mr. Schrieber, by direction of the government. The contractors for the masonry were the well-known firm of Sooysmith & Co., of New York, who have had an extensive experience in this kind of work. The Phoenix Bridge Company, of' Phoenixville, Pa., are the contractors for the iron work.
