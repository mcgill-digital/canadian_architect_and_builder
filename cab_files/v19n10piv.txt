<person>H.	M. Consul </person>at Philadelphia (Mr. <person>W. Powell</person>) refers to the difficulty sometimes found in making cement roofing tiles, namely, that they take a long time to set or harden. He says 'A maker of roofing tiles who had considerable trouble with the cement in this way observed that a plasterer facing a wall with cement put a handful of soda into the mixing box before using the cement. This, he stated, was for the purpose of making the cement set quickly. The tile maker experimented himself, since which time he has added a handful or soda to each sack of cement, and has had no further trouble with slow setting. It has

not yet been proved, however, what the effect of the soda will be upon the quality and durability of the cement in the course of time."



Mr. <person>G. H. Bradbury</person>, manager of the <firm>Manitoba Pressed Brick Company</firm>, is credited with the statement that a company has been organized for the purpose of installing a sand lime brick plant at Regina. Mr. Bradbury says the Berg system has proven a great success, there being over one hundred plants operating under this system in the different states to the south. In Canada the Ottawa, Port Arthur, Toronto and Manitoba



plants are all doing excellent work and producing a very fine brick. The Regina plant will bc up-to-date. The Berg system  the only one that has made a success of hydrating the lime properly.
