January, 1893                                                         THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.                 11                                                             large trestle bridges and several small pile bridges one has some conception of the magnitude of such an undertaking in the hands of a private company. The construction of this line involved the expenditure of some $35,000, but the quality of the stone and the certain prospect of a very large and lucrative business prompted the company to take this means of placing the product of the quarry on the market. The track now runs along the whole front of the quarry and all stone is loaded directly on to the cars. Two sidings have been provided for extra accommodation and a piling ground for the storage of surplus stone of different kinds is served by two extra derricks. The company have recently bought several acres of quarry land in addition to their original purchase, and intend this winter erecting a large boarding house and cottages for the proper housing of their employees.

Though business has been comparatively dull for the last year this stone has been gradually but surely establishing itself and proving to practical men that the long felt want of a first-class native sandstone is at last supplied, and the <firm>Owen Sound Stone Company </firm>feel assured that the more dealers and the general public become acquainted with the stone the less foreign stone will be used in the Province. This company has also grey limestone' quarries at Owen Sound and a quarry near Inglewood on the Credit Valley branch of the <firm>C. P. R</firm>. For the last five years the Owen Sound Company has been engaged in building as well as selling stone. For several years they had from 300 to 6oo men employed in excavating and building railway work in different parts of Ontario. Amongst other works which they undertook and completed in a satisfactory manner were the Sherbourne street and Rosedale bridges in the city of Toronto, the masonry for the Belt Line Railway, the large bridge over the Thames at London, some two miles of bridging and culverts comprising all the foundation and dimension masonry for the C. P. R. Company's extension across the Don flats, the immense shops at Toronto Junction and some thirty or forty bridges and culverts on the Credit Valley, Ontario & Toronto G. & B., all for the C. P. R. The great bulk of the stone used in these works was taken from their great limestone quarries at Owen Sound, which has no superior anywhere for this class of work.



THE <firm>LONGFORD QUARRY AND LIME CO.

</firm>

The Quarries of this Company are situated on the shores of Lake St. Johns, in the township of Rama, County of Ontario, and the Company's address is Longford Mills, Ont. The formation of limestone from these quarries is very fine, the beds of each layer of rock being exceedingly level and but very few dries or cracks appearing in them. The color is of steel grey when first taken out of the quarry; after being exposed for some time it becomes lighter in color, and its general appearance is then almost like marble glistening with glass. The thickness of the different layers of the strata runs from 5 1/2 inches to 16 inches, but the finest layers work splendidly to 12 and 14 inches, while the 5 1/2 inch bed cuts into window sills and heads.

The facility for shipping is all that could be desired, a switch off the main line of the G. T. Ry.( Northern Division) enters the quarry and large and convenient derricks are placed so that a large quantity may be loaded every day.

The company have been fortunate in tendering for many large contracts for their stone, and refer the building trade with satisfaction to the following structures which have been supplied by them; The palatial residence of Mr. <person>S. H. Janes </person>at North Toronto, the foundation for a large part of the <building>New Victoria University</building>, the <building>Freehold Loan Building</building>, the <building>New Drill Shed</building>, the <building>New Court House</building>, the <building>Confederation Life Building</building>, the new <building>Athletic Club building</building>, the center pier of the King Street Subway, all in the City of Toronto. They also furnished a large quantity of foundation stone for the Edison works and <person>Peter Hamilton</person>'s large ware-rooms at Peterboro', Ont., also a large quantity for decorating around windows and doors of <building>St. Joseph's R. C. Church</building> in the township of Douro, and have just completed shipment of the decorative pillars and fence around the <building>Customs buildings in Peterboro'</building>, which adds very much to the general appearance of that handsome structure. The magnificent new post office at Orillia has all its stone work from these quarries. The company is composed of <firm>Messrs. William and George Thompson</firm>, of Orillia, Ont. (the well known and pushing lumbermen of <firm>Longford Mills</firm>), Mr. <person>Andrew Craig </person>as manager, who is considered to be one of the best quarry men in Ontario, and Mr. <person>Maxwell Hall </person>as secretary treas. With the record of the past and the business ability of the members of the company, the building trade have a guarantee that any business entrusted to them will be carried out in good faith.

The company believe in advertising, and in order to bring their material before the public they erected a beautiful monument with a piece of wall at the exhibition grounds at Toronto during the past season, and now with pleasure refer the trade to their advertisment in the columns of this journal.



MIRAMICHI STONE.



About two miles below Newcastle, New Brunswick, on the Miramichi River, is situated the historical French Fort Cove property, comprising about twelve hundred acres, owned and occupied by Mr<person>. C. E. Fish</person>. The place derives its name from the fact that many years ago, when the French occupied this portion of the Cove, a stone...by  the English. Just inside

the Cove, and extending at least two miles up the bank, are almost inexhaustible beds of Freestone, suitable for building stone, bridge stone, and abrasive purposes. The deposit is regular, ranging from twenty feet down to thin sheets, and is probably the most extensive deposit of sandstone in Eastern Canada. Like the sandstone deposits in all districts, it varies in fineness, color and density.

The building stone, known as "Miramichi Stone" (Miramichi meaning "happy retreat"), is of a rich olive color, and possesses all the merits of a first-class structural material. It is easily worked and long years of exposure have failed to change its color or density.

The "<building>Langevin Block</building>" in Ottawa, New <building>City Hall in Hamilton</building>, Ont., the residences of Messrs. <person>James Ross </person>and <person>Dun McIntyre</person>, in Montreal, are a few of the buildings more  recently constructed entirely of this stone. The coarser grades h been largely used for bridges, culverts, docks and general foundation purposes under water. It is particularly well adapted paving purposes, its grittiness giving a good foothold when its hardness prevents wearing smooth, and its non-absorbing qualities render it capable of shedding ice and snow readily There is also a good grindstone and wood pulp stone quarry on the property, but as yet it has only been worked on a small scale.

The quarry is equipped with modern machinery throughout and has good shipping facilities by rail or water. Mr. <person>James Laurie</person>, 162 St. James Street, Montreal, is sole agent for the quarries. 

A FINE QUARRY.



What is now said to be one of the best stone quarries in



Dominion and perhaps on the continent, is

situated one hundred and forty miles below

Quebec, three miles from Pistoles station of

 the Intercolonial Railway, which is also the

St. Lawrence River, thus affording facilities

for shipping rail and vessel.



The quarry is a mountain of red sandstone of the most beautiful color and of the very best grain. It covers an area of about two miles long by half a mile broad, and ranges from twenty to one hundred and fifty feet high. The property acquired from several farmers by Mr. <person>F. G. Dube</person>, of River de Loup, Que., a couple of years ago. Mr. Dube, although a very enterprising gentleman, was not able to go into the working of the quarry on account of ill-health, and to the regret of his friends died in May last, leaving this magnificent property out realizing anything from it himself. Samples of the were sent to New York, Boston and Montreal, where it recognized by connoiseurs to be of a superior quality color. It is claimed to have many points of superiority over imported Scotch stone, as it is acclimated to our country will not be damaged by exposure to the weather, but instead will increase in strength with age. It is of a very close and co grain, and can be cut to any shape desired. When fresh from the quarry it is soft and easy to work. A sample which lately sent to this office justifies the superiority in character claimed for this stone. We understand that this quarry would have to be sold to close the estate of the late Mr. Dube. This ought to prove a rare chance for some one interested in the business.
