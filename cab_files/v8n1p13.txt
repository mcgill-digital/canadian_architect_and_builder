<doctype type="text;plate">Possession of the premises was given to contractors on the 30th of May, and the work of tearing down the old building was actively prosecuted. The time allowed for the erection of the building being limited to less than six months, it became necessary to carry up the walls with the utmost speed. The steel frame was erected to the height of 32 feet above the sidewalk, and the brickwork began at this point on the 7th of August. The setting of the cut stone columns, beginning at the street level, was simultaneously carried on. On the 17th of September the roof was being boarded in, although the upper story was not closed in for lack of terra-cotta. The plastering was begun on the 4th October. On December 4th the last window frame was set. In the meantime all the floors but the first were finished and made ready for occupation, the first floor being finished about 10 days after the occupation of the premises. The moving into the new store was accomplished on the night of December 4th. A large number of workmen began pulling down the temporary partitions at 6 p.m. At the same time the new fixtures which had been delivered a few days previously, were being set in place, including a number in the old buildings. A large staff of clerks then transferred the goods to the new shelving, and by nine a. m. the next day the premises were ready for business, although many small items still remained in a somewhat incomplete state. The time occupied was six months and four days, from the date of commencing to tear down the old buildings. The columns and beams are of steel and the joists of Southern pine. The ground floor piers are of Corsehill stone and the work above of buff brick and terra-cotta. The building is plastered with Acme cement, the steel columns and beams being encased with the same, metal lath being employed for the columns. There are three electric elevators, two passenger and one freight, running from cellar to roof. The building is heated by steam, having a battery of four boilers placed under the sidewalk, three being sufficient for the work, leaving one in reserve. The lighting of the new building is by the incandescent arc system, all the wiring being exposed. The shop windows are lighted with incandescent lamps, arranged to concentrate the light upon the goods without being themselves an obtrusive feature. The internal fittings have been specially designed and are executed in ash and oak. Special attention has been given to the day lighting of the building. Light is admitted to the basement through pavement lights set in the sidewalk and through an arrangement of sloping plate glass windows reaching from the pavement lights to the sill line of the shop windows, which gives a view of the basement from the street and admits a flood of light, obviating largely the use of artificial light.

Walls of elevations not shown to circulated through radiators for warming rooms which are otherbe supported on piers. All masonry to be of local rock or stone, wise heated by a furnace with difficulty. Some trouble has been experienced in getting the water heater properly proportioned to the air heating capacity of the furnace, or in connecting just the right amount of radiation with it to get a satisfactory quantity of hot air without boiling the water. Such satisfaction has attended the use of the apparatus that this method of heating is growing rapidly in popularity. One of the taking features is that a positive heat is afforded by the radiators and a positive change of air is the result of the constant inflow of hot air from the registers. As in many other branches of domestic engineering, the authorities do not agree as to the best methods of installation. Some say that the lower floors of the building should be heated by hot air and the upper floors by the radiators, while others hold that a radiator and register should be placed in each room to secure satisfactory results. With the first method there is some possibility of the rooms warmed by radiators becoming overheated when the furnace is fired strong enough to keep those heated by hot air comfortable. With the latter method strong firing cannot produce such an effect. The installation of the double system is, however, more expansive.
