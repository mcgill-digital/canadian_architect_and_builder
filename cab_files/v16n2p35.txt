work were then extremely high. It is rather hard as yet, the contractors find, to determine the prices of either material or labor and on account of this enough has to be allowed, and in figuring they must allow on the right side.

Of work that has been mentioned as probable to start this spring the Union Bank, the <building>Bank of British North America</building> and the <building>Canadian Pacific Railway station </building>arc among the largest. The Union Bank is to be a ten storey building with steel construction and fire proof throughout, the plans of which are now being prepared by Messrs. <firm>Darling Pearson & Over</firm>. The Bank of British North America will be much smaller, being, as I understand, only three to four storeys in height. '[lie plans of this are now being prepared by Mr. <person>Andrew T. Taylor</person>, F.R.I.RA., Montreal. Several large warehouses are to be erected this year, the plans or which are now in the hands of local architects. Some of these warehouses will cost in the vicinity of $50,000.

A competition has recently been held for the <building>Winnipeg Carnegie Public Library</building>, and although I do not wish to expatiate on this matter I would like to place before you some of the facts relating to the conditions. The cost of the building, including architects' fees and all permanent fittings, was fixed at $75,000. Three premiums were granted $300 (which was to be included in architect's fee if work was proceeded with), $200, $100. A special committee of the Council of the City of Winnipeg has awarded the premiums. Eight sets of drawings were sent in, all of them being in the opinion of the Council most creditable. The drawings are not yet on exhibition and the only ones I have seen are those or the successful competitor, Mr. <person>H. S. Griffiths</person> who kindly allowed me to see his design. He regretted that he was not in a position to allow hi— design n to be published until alter he had received tenders, which close on thc 24th inst., for if the total cost of the work exceeds the amount specified in the conditions, the work is placed in the hands of the next successful competitor. In plan, Mr. Griffiths has, I think, been very successful and the working of the library should be most satisfactory. In his elevations, however, he has I think been a little too

severe and a little more elaboration would have improved the elevations much. He has promised to permit his designs to be published in the March issue of your paper and I will then forward them on to you. It is rather regrettable regarding the criticism and awarding of the designs, that it was conducted under such adverse conditions. It is a well-known fact that the "man on the street" knows practically nothing about the true principles of architecture, and for a body of such men to undertake the criticism and placing of the competitive designs in their order of merit makes the result of the whole work a deplorable fiasco. It seems lamentable that the commissions for such public buildings should be so often granted in this hopeless manner. Of course it may be said that this form of procedure is often adopted and a precedent thereby instituted, but strenuous efforts on the part of architects should be made whereby the criticism of such drawings would be placed in the hands of some competent arbiter. The method employed in this case was as follows—each plan was submitted with its nom-de-plume, which, by the way, an alderman stated was a dissimulation, as he understood die names were known to some of the members of the Council. After several meetings of the Council was held and serious consideration given to the various drawings, they announced that to them the drawings all looked so much alike that they were incapable of' determining on any special set. A meeting or the whole city Council was therefore convened to act in conjunction with them and to again discuss the relative merits of each design. The result of this proceeding was that the Council voted on all the drawings and the five most favored were again handed over to be dealt with by the special committee, who accordingly finally determined on the three best.

The mistake made I think, was that when the special Committee found that they were incapable of making a choice between the drawings they did not call in some experienced, capable and thoroughly unbiased authority and thereby obtain an equitable and satisfactory decision.

I notice in the daily press that an offer has been made by <person>Mr. Carnegie </person>to Toronto of a large sum for the erection of a similar building to the above. If this is accepted and a competition held a more satisfactory arrangement than the above, it is to be hoped, will be arrived at.

I intended forwarding to you photograph of the <building>Canada Life Building</building>, but have been unable to get this in time for this issue.
