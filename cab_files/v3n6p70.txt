MANUFACTURES AND MATERIALS

<article title="Mnaufactures and MaterialsBritish Columbia Marble" author="">BRITISH COLUMBIA MARBLE.

A

T <firm>Rudge's marble works</firm>, Victoria, two fine specimens—the one of excellent sandstone, the other of pure white marble—are at present attracting the admiration of all interested in mineralogy, says the Victoria B. C., Colonist. The sandstone, which is of remarkably good color and grain, was recently discovered to exist in immense quantity on Addington Island, near Alert Bay. The samples brought down are of a fine, gradatious stone, which cuts, saws or bores well, and which will stand fire better than any known fire brick. This last mentioned quality renders it especially adapted .for furnace building, while it can also be used to splendid advantage by builders and in monumental work.

Addington Island, where the quarries are located, contains about one hundred acres of the sandstone. Messrs. <person>Howson</person> and <person>Rudge</person> are the owners of the valuable find, and their intention is to develop it at once. It is pronounced of harder, closer grain than the Vermont production, and is said to be comparable only with Italian. It cuts well and takes an unsurpassed polish, while its stolidity ensures its durability. Of the full extent of the supply which is contained in the mountain at Knight's Inlet, little is known. The deposit appears inexhaustible—at any rate, there is enough to last the Pacific coast for centuries. Rutland marble now monopolizes the trade of America, but the owners of the Knights Inlet mine expect to

compete successfully with the Vermonters, having a better article, which they will be able to sell just as cheaply. It is anticipated that the new marble will take the place of all imported material here at once, and that the trade that will be opened up by its exportation to the United States will constitute another important and profitable industry for British Columbia.



An effort is to be made to at once form a company at Kingston, Ont., to manufacture Portland cement.

A company is being formed in St. Thomas to manufacture water pipes. They will attempt to supply the material required for the new water works.

The <firm>Sicily Asphaltum Paving Company</firm>, with headquarters at Montreal, are seeking incorporation with a capital stock of $30,000 for establishing works for the preparation of asphaltum for paving streets, roads, etc.

A convention of the <assoc>International Association of Adamant wall plaster manufacturers </assoc>was held at the Leland Hotel, Syracuse, N. Y., on June 10th and 11th. All matters affecting the trade were fully discussed, and

pleasant and profitable time was spent. Messrs. <person>W. J. Hynes</person>, Manager, and <person>W. B. Cherry</person>, Secretary-Treasurer of the Canadian company, were present and took part in the proceedings.

The <firm>Golden State Quarry Company</firm>, recently organized in British Columbia, are the owners of an extenave slate deposit near Kicking Horse River. There is now a surface of slate uncovered 30 x 500 feet, and the ledge runs into a mountain about 300 feet in height. The company intends to make roofing, slate copings for walls, window sills, cornices, brackets, chimney pieces, street flagging, etc. The quality of the slate is said to be first-class.
