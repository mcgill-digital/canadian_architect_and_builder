AT the convention of the <assoc>National Association of Master Plumbers of the United States</assoc>, held last month at Philadelphia, Mr. <person>John Date</person>, of Montreal, was introduced as the representative of the <assoc>Montreal Master Plumbers' Association</assoc>, and a communication from the Montreal Association was read expressing a desire for affiliation with the American organization. Mr. Date was cordially received, and there is no doubt but that his presence at the convention will tend to promote good feeling between the master plumbers of the United States and of this country. Mr. Date will also no doubt have gathered some information which can be used to advantage in the work of the Canadian organization. At the convention referred to, a resolution was passed requesting manufacturers to discontinue the practice of selling goods to persons who are not legitimately in the business. The definition of a "Master Plumber" agreed to by the Association was: "An individual who represents the industry of plumbing in its most complete state, that is to say, that he must be the proprietor of a plumbing establishment who deals in the merchandise used in the various branches of the business; who engages in trade with the public generally; who hires a requisite number of men, for the purpose of practically constructing plumbing systems in buildings everywhere, and is himself responsible for the work accomplished."



DOUBTS of a serious nature are obtruding themselves into some minds concerning the value of asphalt as a material for permanent street pavements. The city of Toronto has spent upwards of a million dollars on asphalt pavements within the last five years. Some of the pavements thus recently constructed are already full of cracks and holes. This is especially true of those on streets traversed by the street railway. The constantly recurring vibration from the passing cars appears to result in disintegrating the asphalt covering, patches of which become separated from the concrete foundation, leaving here and there ugly appearing and dangerous ruts. Even on streets where there are no street car tracks the pavements show numerous cracks and depressions. It is noticeable that in the first pavements of this character laid in Toronto eight or ten years ago, these defects are not to be seen, which is regarded as evidence that either greater skill or care was exercised in their construction. The statement has recently been made that the frequent sprinkling of the pavement in summer causes it to become rotten and greatly tends to shorten its life. As to the correctness of this statement we do not presume to speak. If it is well founded, then in deciding upon the extensive use of this pavement one of the most important requirements was overlooked. While in appearance and in several other particulars asphalt is the ideal of what a pavement should be, unless it can be made more durable than it gives evidence of being on some of the streets in Toronto, it will not repay its cost. At London, Ont., where a considerable amount of paving is to be done, this question appears to be receiving the careful attention which its importance demands. It is by no means certain that a well constructed macadam roadway will not eventually supersede some of the pavements which have recently come into favor.
