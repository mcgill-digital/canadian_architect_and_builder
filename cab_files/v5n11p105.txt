WE had hoped to be able to print in this number the remainder of the papers read at the recent Convention of the Province of Quebec Association of Architects, but the space at our disposal proves not to be sufficient for the purpose In consequence the interesting paper by <person>Mr. Baillairgé</person>, of Quebec, on "Means of Escape from Public Buildings in Case of Fire," is held over until next issue.



IN placing heavy weights on a floor, such, for instance, as a safe, it is often desired to know which is the best position for safety. This is easily determined. The floor boards will show the direction of the joists, and the safe should he placed in such a position that it rests on the ends of the joists, so that several of them support it. If the safe were placed against the middle of a wall to which the joists run parallel, the weight would all rest on two, or at the most three joists, and at the worst place, viz., the centre.



A BUREAU of Hygiene and Sanitation has been organized to prepare a collective exhibit for the Colombian Exhibition illustrative of the present condition of sanitary science. Dr. <person>F. W. Brewer </person>is the Superintendent of the Bureau, In this connection we observe that the Provincial Board of Health of Ontario has decided to assist in collecting the material for a Canadian special Sanitary exhibit at the World's Fair. With that object communication will he had with the local boards of health and with manufacturers and dealers in sanitary appliances.



THE preliminary arrangements have been made for a Canadian art exhibit at the Columbian Exhibition. A Committee, representing the various art societies, will select the subjects at exhibitions to be held in Montreal and Toronto in February. A hanging committee will be appointed and a competent person to represent Canadian artists at Chicago. The hanging committee will assume the responsibily for the safe return of the exhibits to Canada. It is to be regretted that the enthusiasm which is being manifested by the artists has not also taken possession of the architects.



WE understand that some sixty designs were submitted in the preliminary competition for plans for public buildings at Victoria, B. C., to which reference was made in our last issue. Mr. S. G. Curry, President of the Ontario Association of Architects, and Mr. A. T. Taylor, member of the Council of the Province of Quebec Association of Architects, have been appointed to judge the designs, and to select the five which in their opinion possess the most merit. The authors of these will be required to submit designs in a final competition. Messrs. Curry and Taylor are at present in British Columbia making an examination of the preliminary designs.



Building contractors might well learn the lesson of how to estimate from the contractors for public works, who, while dealing with contracts of vastly greater magnitude, vary but slightly in their tenders. As an example, we may cite the case of the tenders for the construction of the Soulanges Canal. For section II, five of the lowest tenders were in this order. $278,812, $281,740, $183,479, $289,649, $262,865. For section 12, six of the lowest tenders were as follows $234,561, $235,218, $239,342, $240,990, $244,000. For section 13, several of the lowest tenders ranged as follows $532,129, $552,629, $556,537, $559,695, These figures indicate that a more business-like method of esti
