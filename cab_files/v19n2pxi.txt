<doctype type="textad">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER



yellows, russet browns and tans are suitable for hall decorations. In libraries rich hues are necessary, such as reds, browns, olive greens and deep blues. For dining-rooms the warm colours, such as soft reds, bright greens and browns are frequently used. Tapestry papers are also effective, especially some of the finer examples of fruit and scenic tapestries. The drawing-room and reception room are best decorated in light tints in shades of green, rose, ivory and yellow. In bedrooms and dressing-rooms self-tones of the softer shades are very appropriate. Floral designs on a white or cream background are also suitable, as they give an apartment a cheerful and inviting appearance.

We will next consider the woodwork as a guide. We have two rules to follow in this case ; namely, to treat the walls in a self-harmony in the colour of the wood itself, or to use colours which contrast with the woodwork. In following the latter course it is very

important that the contrasts should not be of so violent a character as to be objectional. The amount of woodwork should also be considered, as a room with a lot of door and window frames will not stand as strong a colour contrast as a room in which the wall space largely predominates.

We must also consider the walls as a background

for pictures.	 The colour that agrees best with all

classes of pictures is a maroon red. For a room in which water colours only are to be hung, a sage green

is the best.	For oil paintings a bright red makes the

best background ; for engravings and etchings either green or red is very satisfactory. Rooms in which the walls are to be almost covered with pictures are best treated in plain colours, as a pattern is liable to detract from the pictures themselves.

There are many other things which could be considered, but I think the points I have touched upon are sufficient to open up the subject for discussion.
