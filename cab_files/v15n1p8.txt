<article title=" A CONTRACTOR'S MEMORY JOGGER " author="Brown, Edward Hurst">A CONTRACTOR'S MEMORY JOGGER.

A few days ago, writes <person>Edward Hurst Brown</person>, in the Painters' Magazine, I was in the office of a large







































firm of painters who do a great deal of new work, and are constantly figuring on all important jobs in the architects' offices in their city. The member of the firm who makes up the estimates had on the wall back of his desk, a blackboard, made on a novel plan. A sheet of ground plate glass about four feet wide by two feet high had been fastened to the wall, the roughened side out, with a narrow trough at the bottom for slate pencils and eraser. Before the glass had been put up the back had been divided by narrow white lines into sections, as shown by the sketch, which has been reproduced, and after the white lines had thoroughly dried, the entire back was given two coats of black and afterwards varnished, in order to preserve it from dampness. This made a blackboard on the principle of a child's drawing slate, which would stand any amount of wear and tear, and could be written on with a soft

slate pencil or white crayon, and might he easily cleaned. On this board the name o1 every job on which estimates had been asked, together with the date when they were wanted, and name of the person or persons to whom the bids were to be sent, was entered. If invitations had been received from a number of builders, all the names were written in the appropriate column. If the bid was to go to the architects, their name appeared. If the owner asked for the figures, his name alone was mentioned.

By referring to this blackboard, a glance would indicate what was to be figured on. As soon as a bid is sent for any job, the letter '' S " is written boldly across it, this being omitted, of course, if for any reason the firm did not care to figure. There is no chance to forget all about an invitation that you particularly desired to respond to, and let the time for sending in your bid go by. Just consider a bit and figure for yourself whether a memory jogger such as this would not pay for its cost many times over in the course of a year.





<article title=" THE INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS AND SCAFFOLDS " author="">THE INSPECTION OF BUILDINGS AND SCAFFOLDS.



<assoc>The Federated Building Trades Council </assoc>are urging the appointment by the City Council of Toronto of a civic inspector of scaffolds and the City Commissioner is said to have promised to recommend that such an official be appointed. '[he knowledge of their legal







































liability is sufficient to ensure care on the part of most, if not all contractors in the construction of scaffolds. There is therefore good reason to doubt the charge of carelessness in this particular which has been laid at their door by the Trades Council. On the other hand there is no doubt about the fact that in their own interest, as well as that of the workmen, contractors frequently find it necessary to urge upon their employees the exercise of greater care in construction using scaffolds. The appointment of a scaffold inspector would probably fail to meet the case. A single inspector could not properly perform the duties, and the cost of several inspectors would be out of proportion to the risk. If there were two inspectors of buildings they should be able to greatly improve the supervision of constructional work and incidentally look after the proper construction of scaffolds.
