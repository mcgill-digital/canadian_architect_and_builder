<article title="Portland Cement Affected by Time" author="">PORTLAND CEMENT AFFECTED BY TIME.

A correspondent signing himself "Architect" writes as follows to the London Building News :â€”Have you or any of your readers found that Portland cement in course of time occasionally acts curiously and in a manner which I do not pretend to account for? It will remain dormant for say, five, ten, or even twenty years, and then become active to this extent, that mosaic flooring and the like will come away from its screeding,

and plastering will lose its key from walls built in cement, so that when you tap the surface of the walling the plaster sounds hollow, just as the flooring does. I do not refer to blowing of cement improperly mixed. The action I speak of does not refer to any changed or fresh conditions. The cement gradually appears to become deteriorated till at last it becomes sufficiently disintegrated to have lost its rigid cohesive strength. This condition is to be observed in high-class work. How is this, and what steps can be taken to obviate ?
