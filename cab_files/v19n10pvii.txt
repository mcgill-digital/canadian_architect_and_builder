<doctype type="text;ad">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	vii.



A wealthy manufacturer in the potteries is at present the subject of a good joke. While on a continental tour he purchased a Sevres vase for some hundreds of pounds and brought it home most carefully.

Thinking that the foreman of his works might gather a hint from the design, he called that gentleman in and showed him his treasure. "How do you like it?" he asked.

The foreman took the vase in his hand, turned it over and

returned it with the brief reply: "I don't think that I can learn much. from it.

"Why not?" asked the manufacturer.

''I don't like telling you, sir."

"Come—out with it."

"Well, I designed that vase myself. It is a foreign imitation of our own work and is worth £5 at the outside. "—-Liverpool Post.
