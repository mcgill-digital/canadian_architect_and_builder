(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.) 



T

HE designs received in competition for the proposed new <building>City Hall quebec</building>number seven, four of them being contributed by local architects. The Road Committee, who have the matter in charge, will shortly appoint three experts to examine and report on the various plans submitted.

The <firm>Fortress Hotel Company</firm>'s invitation for competitive plans for their new building has brought Out four competitors. A sub-committee of three directors has been named to examine the plans and report to a meeting of the full Board at an early date. American as well as Canadian architects are represented in this as well as the first named competition.

The work of extending the water and drainage systems of the city to the newly annexed wards formerly comprised in the municipality of St. Sauveur, is being actively carried on. The work is in charge of Mr. <person>Charles. Baillairge</person>, City Engineer, with Mr. <person>J. Gallagher </person>as assistant engineer, and Mr. <person>Andrew Hatch</person>, chief foreman. The principal main is a 12" one, fed from both the 30" and 18" mains from Lorette, from whence the city supply is obtained, 8 miles distant. Either or both of the mains may at will be connected with the 12" pipe. Distributing mains of 8", 6" and 4" are being laid through the side streetsâ€”very little of the latter size being used. These distributors are supplied by four intersecting 8" mains. Stop cocks are so arranged as to shut off but a small portion of any part of the wards in the event of repairs being made. About 100 two branch post hydrants are being placed so as to secure adequate fire protection. The iron pipes are of Canadian manufacture, and are being supplied by Messrs. <firm>Drummond, McCall & Co</firm>., of Montreal.

The main drain is built of brick, and is oval in section, 3' 9 in. high and 2' 6 in. wide. Into this are connected 18 in., 15 in. and 12" branch drains

made by the <firm>Standard Pipe Co.</firm>, of St. Johns, P. Q., and furnished by <firm>G. M. Webster & Co</firm>., of this city. All the work (except the main brick sewers and all excavations) is being done by the corporation by day's work, this, from past experience having been proved to be the better way to secure good work at a moderate cost, It is expected the cost will be about $250,-ooo for the entire system. The population of the two new wards is about

22,000.



The travel this year to the great fishing lakes in the lake St. John district has been so great that the <building>hotel at Roberval</building>, the terminus of the road, has been found entirely too small, consequently the proprietor, Mr. <person>H. Beemer</person>, has decided to add two wings, three stories in height, 103 feet long

and 37 feet wide, giving 95 additional bed rooms and a long dining room of 70 X 35 feet. in addition, there is also to be a billiard room and a bowling alley. The whole frontage towards the lake will measure feet, and to. wards the railroad 103 feet. The plans have just been completed by <person>Mr. Stavely</person>, architect. The work will be done by day's work.

Mr. <person>J. Y. Peachy</person>, architect, has now in hand the various works required in the completion of <building>St. John's Church Quebec</building>, including the plastering of the interior, new pews, etc., the congregation hitherto having been obliged to use the church in its unfinished state owing to lack of funds. The cost of the present undertaking will be about $40,000. This church it may be remembered was destroyed in the great conflagration of June 8th, 1881, when a large part of St. John's ward was burned.

There is a great dearth of plasterers here. All work in that line proceeds in an extremely slow way. Good hands are receiving $3 per day.

It is expected that a general meeting of all architects practising in the Province of Quebec will take place in Montreal on October 10th to form a <assoc>Province of Quebec Architects' Association</assoc>, the preliminaries thereto having been agreed upon by correspondence between the architects of Montreal and Quebec.



The offices of the <firm>Toronto Pressed Brick Company </firm>have been removed from the <building>Quebec Bank Chambers </building>to No. 52 Adelaide St. east, ground floor.

<firm>The Adamant Manufacturing Company</firm>'s premises in Toronto were again visited by fire last month, and their stock damaged to the extent of about $1,500. The effects of the occurrence having been overcome, business is again being proceeded with as usual.

The incorporation is announced of the <firm>Richmond Slate Quarrying and Asbestos Company</firm>, of Richmond, Que., capital stock $150,000, to manufacture roofing slate, slabs, and other products of slate, clay, asbestos, etc.

Incorporation has been granted the <firm>British Columbia Pottery and Terra Company</firm>, Victoria, B. C. New machinery has been ordered and new kilos are being built. The company will manufacture sewer pipe, flower pots, drain tile, chimney pots, tiles, terra cotta, etc.

Mr. <person>F. J. White</person>, of London, Eng., proposes to organise a company in Canada for the manufacture of a new kind of brick, the patent of which he is said to have sold in the United States for $750,000. This brick, which is styled granite, is manufactured from silica, resembles marble, has a very smooth surface, and can be highly polished.
