Shellac and borax boiled in water produces a good stain for doors. 

The Peterboro Bridge Works have been removed to premises. 

 The Beaverton Brick and Tile Co. have dissolved partnership. Mr. Taylor will in future conduct the business.

 A company formed in this city recently will establish large works near the mouth of- the Niagara River for the manufacture of heaving furnaces, etc. 

A test of the new pumping machinery for the Water Works  Department of Hamilton, shoved the pumping capacity of the



engines to be in excess of the requirements.

The beautiful enamelled bricks frequently used for outside or interior decoration are made by applying to the surface a colored far which during the burning causes the silex to melt and cause a vitreous covering

Mr. R. Davis, ship builder, has closed a contract with a tare  proof cc-at works company of Montreal to freight 2,000 tons of soapstone from Portland Bay, Rideau Lake, to Montreal during the coming summer.

Operations have been going on briskly at the Forks of the  Credit, notwithstanding the severity of the weather. Messrs.

Scott & Pattullo Armstrong & Sharp and Britnell & Co., are each giving employment to twelve amen.

 The   bulk of  the stone used in the construction of the new international Bridge at Sault Ste. Marie was quarried at Owen Sound. Ont. Mr. R. M. Paterson, the inspector of masonry, says the quality of this stone is unsurpassed on this continent.

A colossal stick of- lumber from Puget Sound has been contributed to the Mechanics' Exhibition at San Francisco. Its length

151 feet. and it is 20 x 20 inches through. It is believed to be the longest piece of timber ever turned out. of any saw mill.

At meeting of the St. Thomas Plate Glass Association held a few days ago, the following directors were appointed :—J. J. Mickleborough. A. M. Hutchinson, Dr. McLarty, Alex. Lindsay and Dr. Luton. Dr. McLarty was elected President and J. P. Martyn, Secretary-Treasurer. 

		The hungerford Marble Quarry Co., Madoc, Ont., are	receiving every encouragement as the result of their recent explorations. It has been demonstrated, as the opening of the vein continues. that the marble is there in paving quantities and of a very good quality. Mr. Whitney, the manager, expects to have the product

	of these quarries in the market during the coming summer.		The

industry promises to return handsome profits and employ a large number of men. 

A new 

invention designed to take the place of stained glass is

white paper manufactured from cotton or linen and modified by chemical action. The paper is dipped into a preparation of alcohol and camphor, which makes it like parchment. From this point it can be molded and cut into remarkably tough sheets, entirely translucent. and can be dyed with almost the whole outline colors, the result being a translucent sheet showing, it is said, far more vivid hues than the best glass exhibits.

Rocks composed of chlorite are found in various parts of the world, and are used for ornamental constructions, especially for making smaller objects which can be turned with a lathe. These

are the stories which are called by the French pierres ollaires. A chlorite from Potton, in Lower Canada, has been used. It is. found in beds of the Lower Silurian age. lying immediately upon the Laurentian rocks; it is associated with dolomite or serpentine, and, like the latter rock, it contains some chrome iron.

TEST FOR GLUE. - The following simple and easy test for glue is given: A weighed piece of glue (say one-third of an ounce) is suspended in water for hours, the temperature of which is not above 50° Fah. The coloring material sinks, and the glue swells from the absorption of the water. The glue is then taken out and weighed; the greater the increase in weight the better the glue. If it then be dried perfectly arid weighed again, the weight of the

coloring matter can be calculated from the difference between this and the original weight.

We learn from the London Free Press that arrangements are in progress with a firm in that city for the construction of a machine. patented by Mr. Israel' Kinney, of Windsor. for the manufacture of patent fire-proof lathing. the machine weighs between eight and ten tons, and will take six or seven months so -build.  It is intended to construct the machine and operate it in London. Mr. Kinney also states that the machine will turn out cresting, grating, screens and bridgework, He has a patent for the invention both in the United States and Canada. 

Iron Bricks. Louis Jochim, of Ottweder, near Saarbruecken, Germany, is introducing paving blocks, which' he calls iron brick. They are made by mixing equal parts of finely ground red argillaceous slate and- finely ground clay, and adding 5 per cent. of iron ore. This mixture is moistened with a solution of 23 per cent. sulphate of iron to which fine iron ore is added until it shows a consistency of 38° Baume. It is then formed in a press, dried, dipped once more in a nearly concentrated solution of sulphate of iron and finely ground iron ore, and is baked in an oven for 48 hours in an oxidizing flame, and 24 hours in a reducing flame. The German Government testing -laboratory for building materials has reported favorably on- this brick.

 How To PREPARE Calcimine.-Soak one pound of white glue over night; then dissolve it in boiling water, and add twenty pounds of Paris white, diluting with water until, the mixture is of the consistency of rich milk. To this any tint can be given that is desired. Lilac.-Add to the calcimine two parts of Prussian blue and one of vermilion, stirring thoroughly, and taking care to avoid too high a color. Gray. —Raw uniber, with a trifling amount of lampblack. Rose.-Three parts of vermilion and one of red lead. added in very small quantities until a delicate shade is produced.

Lavender.-Mix a light blue and tint it slightly with vermilion.

Straw. - Chrome yellow, with a touch of Spanish brown. Buff.— Two parts spruce, or Indian yellow, and one part burnt sienna.



A Russian professor has been experimenting on the best way to remove dry rot. He says that a thorough draught will destroy

the parasite within twenty-four hours. If the action of draught be  - assisted by that of sunlight.- a few hours will often suffice to put a

stop to	damage.  A  concentrated solution of common salt is very efficacious, and the stronger it is used the more rapid its action, The action of a concentrated solution of cupric sulphate (blue stone, blue vitriol) is still more energetic and complete than that of common salt. Crude carbolic acid is rapid in its action and cheap, but inconvenient to use. But he considers that the best, cheapest, and most convenient material to employ is the tar

-'obtained when birch wood is distilled for acetic acid; the tinder surfaces of the flooring are painted with the tar.

Improved BRICKS. - For obtaining products that will offer greater resistance to humidity, etc., than ordinarily is the case, an improved process of manufacturing bricks has been brought forward in Germany. After drying and grinding the clay, a mixture is made of 91 1/2 parts of the latter, 3 parts of iron filings, 2 of table

salt, 1 1/2 of potash, and 2 of elder or willow wood ashes. The whole is heated to temperature varying from 3,362° to 3,632° Fah. At the end of from four to five hours the argillaceous mixture is run into molds, then re-baked in the ovens—always protected from the air—at a temperature of 842° to 932° Fah. The product may be variously colored by adding to the above quantity two parts of manganese for a violet brown, one part of manganese for a violet, one part of copper ashes for a green, one part of arsenite of cobalt for a blue; two parts of antimony for yellow, and one and a half parts of arsenic and one part of oxide of tin for white. 

In the new system of electric bells invented in England and now being introduced, says the Boston Journal of Commerce, the magnet box is dispensed with and the hemispherical bell is replaced

by one of the	the electromagnet,

the latter being a single solenvidal magnet of special construction. and by it the armature is attracted by both poles simultaneously. By this means less than half the usual quantity of wire is required, thus reducing the external resistance of the circuit one-half. Moreover the armature, besides-being magnetized by induction, as acted on in the ordinary method, is directly polarized by being in actual magnetic contact by the connection of the gimbal - which is in one piece with the armature - with the core iron of the magnet; and it is thus induced so perform the largest amount of work with the smallest electromotive force. Again, instead of the armature and clapper being in a straight line attached so a rigid spring, which necessitates a considerable attractive power to -

primarily give it momentum, this new system has the armature and hammer in the form of an inverted U, and being perfectly balanced from the point of suspension. the lines of force front a comparatively small magnetic field suffice to send this improved forms of mature into instant regular vibration. By using a flexible break-and-make arrangement, a better result is attained.

TESTS OF WOOD FOR BUILDING. - J. B. Johnson. director of the U. S. Testing Labratory, at Washington University, says: Manufacturers, builders, architects and too many engineers rely solely on the tables and formulae given in the trade or engineering handbooks. They know nothing of the original experiments from which the tables are derived, and too often are unable even to verify the truth of the formulae. As a psalter of fact, the portions of these books referring to the strength of materials, and especially of wood. were based on experiments on small specimens and were made about 100 years ago! Sonic of the arguments in fat or of at new test are given below. All the old tests were made in England, and, as already remarked, on small specimens. The Western American woods have never been fairly tested for strength. Such tests as have been made on large specimens of American wood have shown the strength to be only about one-half what all the tables give them. Many cheaper kinds of timber may prove more

valuable for structures than more expensive varieties, which have been supposed so be stronger. Thus pine supports or pillars has-e been- found stronger than oak ones, when tested in full-sized samples. Notches cut in beams or joists, whether at the ends or



more than is generally supposed. When a joist is notched into  a floor beam or header, it is only about one-half or one-fourth as strong as when left full size and resting on the bottom. It always splits from the notch. if the portion below the notch be sloped off so as to be the full depth at the middle, the strength is doubled. That is to say, by removing a portion of the joist (in case of a notch), the strength is increased. This seems paradoxical, but it is true in practice and consistent with theory. It then does not fail by splitting from the end, but by breaking apart in the middle. The shearing or splitting strength of timber is of great importance in structures and is almost always overestimated. A few well-arranged tests will give more information to the designer than all the tables in the handbooks on these matters.
