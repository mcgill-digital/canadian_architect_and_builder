<article title="Roman Stone" author="">ROMAN STONE.



The latest evidence of the coming of the Cement Age in building construction is the erection of plants for the manufacture of building stone. Canada's foremost position in this movement is shown by the organization of a company in Toronto known as the <firm>Roman Stone Co.</firm> who have built and equipped a model plant for the manufacture of Roman Stoneâ€”a product whose appearance so closely resembles natural stone as to deceive even the trained eye upon close inspection and whose physical properties are claimed to surpass most of our common building stone.



Coincident with the enormous advance made in the manufacture of Portland cement is the progress made in the art of its proper manufacture. Architects and builders have always known that best results in building are obtained only from men who are experts in their profession. Cement construction is no exception to this rule, although its apparent ease and simplicity of manipulation has led many to believe otherwise. In this way not a few failures have been made in cement construction but it is argued that those who condemn cement stone for this reason

should realize that they are basing their condemnation upon results made possible by conditions for which they alone are responsible.



Being thoroughly cognizant of these conditions the Roman Stone Co. have erected a plant second to none of its kind in existence, have secured the best and most experienced management, selecting men who have already demonstrated their ability in the management of similar plants. They are now prepared to enter into contracts for all classes of stone and cement construction work from the heaviest construction work to the finest interior decorations. They are at present engaged in manufacturing the stone for the <building>Carnegie Library, at Guelph, Ont.,</building> and other work.



The officers of the company are: <person>H. M. Pellatt</person>, President; <person>H. Blain</person>, Vice-President, and <person>G. P. Ames </person>Managing Director. The manufacturing is under the direction of <person>Chas. D. Watson</person>, as Chief Engineer.



We expect to be able to give a detailed description of the company's plant and product in subsequent issue.
