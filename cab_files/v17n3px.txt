The conduits are, of course, grounded to prevent shocks.

The effect of low temperature on iron has recently been investigated by Professor Dewar and Mr. Hadfield, using a bar containing 99.89 per cent, of iron, which is practically pure. Tests at ordinary temperatures showed a tensile strength of 21 tons and an elongation of 25 per cent. in 2 inches. At a temperature of â€” 180 degrees Cent. the tensile strength was increased to 54 tons, but the elongation was nil, The part of the bar that had been subjected to extremely low temperature bent double cold after it had returned to the normal temperature.
