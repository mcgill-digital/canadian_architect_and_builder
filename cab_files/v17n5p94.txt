<article title=" BUILDING CONDITIONS IN MONTREAL " author="">BUILDING CONDITIONS IN MONTREAL.

	

Until quite recently it was believed that no difficulties were

likely to arise this year between workmen and employers in the building trades in Montreal. This expectation has, however, been disappointed. A partial strike of stone cutters has already occurred. The painters' demand that the rate of wages be increased to 25 cents per hour and also that the working hours be reduced to 54 per week has failed. There is also difficulty on the part of the plumbers and bricklayers.

"Goodness, yes."

"Well, he hain't got over his hankerin after em yit; this piece in the paper 'bout millionaires' houses say he has one of the finest collections of Italian marbles in the hull world."—Brooklyn Life.
