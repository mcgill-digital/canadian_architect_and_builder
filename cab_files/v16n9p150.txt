NOTES.



The price of bricks in Vancouver has recently been advanced by $2.00 per thousand, the price now being $11.00.

At the Dominion Fair and in fairs throughout the country the Dunlop exhibit of rubber mats, rubber tiling and rubber flooring, was a particularly interesting display for house owners and house builders. The company have introduced many new features both in designs and material. Their new catalogues arc now out and are worth investigating.
