FIRE-PROOF · FROST-PROOF VERMIN-PROOF SECTIONAL MINERAL WOOL STEAM PIPE AND BOILER COVERING

is fast driving all other competitors out of the market. It is the only covering that WILL NOT CHAR, CRACK, POWDER OR BURN ON HOT AIR OR STEAM PIPES. An essential feature of a non-conducting material is that it shall contain as many air-cells as possible. A cubic foot of Mineral Wool contains from 88 to 92 per cent, of dead air, consequently

as a non-conductor of heat and cold it stands at the head of the list.

Solid plastic coverings, as they do not possess this property in any great degree, are comparatively useless as non-conductors, so that although they may be cheap, HARD-PRESSED COVERINGS ARE THE MOST EXPENSIVE IN THE END.



A word about Hair-felt.

It is objectionable on account of the disagreeable odor it emits when becoming heated and because it harbors vermin. We recently supplied to the Hamilton Insane Asylum over $1500 worth of Mineral Wool Covering to replace hair felt which when removed was found to be very much charred and alive with vermin. This can be verified by reference to the Provincial Inspector of Asylums.

Gentlemen, -- In reply to your request for my opinion respecting boiler covering, I consider your covering good. You have done us a first-class job, and it saves us ten hundred pounds (1,000) of coal every twenty-four hours. Yours respectfully,



(Signed) <person>JOSEPH HALL</person>,

Supt. Windsor Water Works.
