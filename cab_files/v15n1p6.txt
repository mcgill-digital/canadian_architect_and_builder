building proper should he framed just as any other balloon building is framed. The studding may he 2x6 or 2X4 inches, set 16 inches centres, if the walls are not to be lined with boards inside. If they are, then studs may be set 2 feet from center. It is better to line up with boards both the inside and outside, but

A new and <building>completely equipped factory </building>has recently been put up at Southampton, Ont., by <firm>the Lebove company</firm>. The building is of brick with a frontage of 100 feet and depth of 160 feet, giving a floor space of

24,000 square feet. Its arrangement is well shown in the accompanying illustration. It will be seen that the <firm>Grand Trunk Railway </firm>has run a siding into the company's yards, thus allowing the lumber being unloaded direct from the yard to the dry kiln, as well as of the finished material from the factory being placed directly on the cars. A well equipped machine shop is connected with the factory. The machinery is

this of course, is expensive. The boards should then be covered with roofing felt or tarred paper, stayed with laths over the seams. The foundation walls must be made thick enough to admit of the joists resting on them, also the frame-work of sills and brickwork, as shown in Fig. I. The method of construction is very fairly shown in this diagram and may be followed with safety. It will he seen there is an air space left between the bricks and the tarred paper, a very desirable condition. In this diagram there is shown a stone plinth, but this is not necessary, as the bricks

may rest directly on the foundation wall. Fig. 2 shows the boarding, brickwork, ties and studding in perspective; the ties are simply 20 penny nails, cut nails, or if wire nails they must be dipped in hot tar before being used. Fig. 3 shows the manner of constructing the corner in order to make a good solid job. Fig. 4 exhibits the method of preparing for the windows, showing how to form the sash weight boxes and window and door reveal. The manner of finishing under the eaves is shown in Fig. 5. Though there are many other ways of finishing at this point, this is about the most economical and efficient. Floors should be laid double, the first floor formed of sound common lumber, dressed, then all the plastering should be done, base laid and other work done, before finishing floor is laid. Hardwood flooring, good and dry, should be laid in kitchen, and in any other room not intended to be carpeted.

<article title=" THE EDUCATION OF A CARPENTER " author="Maginnis, Owen B.">THE EDUCATION OF A CARPENTER.

By <person>OWEN B. MAGINNIS</person>



How should a carpenter be educated, and how is it possible now-a-days? This was the question put to me a short time ago by a gentleman whose son showed an inclination to use tools, and desired to become a carpenter. It took me a long time to answer it; but he decided by the reply, and will put the boy through the course. The following is the substance of what I told him, and I submit it for the benefit, suggestion and criticism of all carpenters of experience, for they will surely be able to add something to it:

As to age, though it is claimed that the younger a boy adopts his occupation the quicker and better he will learn, still it would not be judicious to have him leave school and go to work before sixteen, or fifteen at the earliest. Not that I believe it impossible for one younger to become adept and skillful, like <person>Lamartine</person>'s Claude, "The Stonemason of St. Point," who, by self-denial and using his father's tools, had reputation and could earn his own living at seventeen. There are many boys above the age of twelve who go out to labor, and achieve great success before they reach twenty. Even considering this, it would be better to wait until the boy had acquired sufficient schooling, an4 is well enough versed in the necessary teachings to use them if called upon; for inability to read, write or cypher correctly may perhaps prove a barrier to complete success in after life. School-time past, the boy should be indentured to a reputable master, or he plac-
