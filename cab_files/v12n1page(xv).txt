TORONTO, March 10.



The Mica Boiler Covering Co., 9 Jordan Street



GENTLEMEN, ,â€”It gives us much pleasure to state that the mica covering on Messrs. Gowans, Kent & Co.'s premises recently burned down is in perfect condition, after going through the severest trial it is possible to imagine. Nether the fire nor the immense quantities of water thrown on it appears to have hurt it in the least. We think you have good reason for saying your Mica Covering is practically indestructible.



Yours truly,



(Signed) SYMONS & RAE,
