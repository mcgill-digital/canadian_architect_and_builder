<article title="British Brick Standards" author="">BRITISH BRICK STANDARDS.



As a result of many conferences between committees of the <assoc>Royal Institute of British Architects </assoc>and the <assoc>British Institute of Clayworkers</assoc>, the following standards for bricks and brickwork have been agreed upon



1. The length of the brick should be double the width plus the thickness of one vertical joint.

2. Brickwork should measure four courses of bricks and four joints to a foot.

Joints should be 1/4in. thick and an extra 1/8, making 3/8 for the bed joints to cover irregularities in the bricks. This gives a standard length of centre to centre of joints.

The bricks to be measured in the following manner

(a)	Light stretchers laid square end and splay end in contact in a straight line to measure 72 in.

(h)	Eight headers laid side to side frog upwards in a straight line to measure 35 in.

(c)	Eight bricks, the first brick frog downwards and then alternately frog to frog and back to back, to measure 21 in.



A margin of one inch less to be allowed as to (a), and 1/2in. less as to (b) and (c).

This is to apply to all classes of walling bricks both machine and hand-made.



Ten pictures, the gift of the industrial Exhibition Association, have recently been added to the nucleus of a collection which in the future will adorn the walls of the Municipal Buildings at Toronto.
