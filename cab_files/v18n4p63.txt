<article title=" THE LEEK RADIATOR " author="">THE LEEK RADIATOR.

Walter Leek, heating engineer, of Vancouver, has patented a steam radiator designed to increase the amount of radiation per square foot of surface by decreasing the length of the air travel. Radiation of heat from steam being due to its condensation and the liberation of latent heat, the value of radiating surface depends upon its condensing power; in other words, upon the difference between the temperature of the steam and the air in contact with the radiator. And, to get the maximum of radiation,

wards the back which is therefore the coolest part. The air, in consequence of the inclination upwards and outwards of the spaces (3a) between the corrugations, will travel from hack to front, meeting increasing heat as it grows increasingly warm. It is claimed therefore by the inventor that there is an active circulation of air through this radiator, and, if the warmed air, as he says, is cast towards the centre of the room the supply should be the cold air passing down the walls and there should be a maximum of radiation.

the coolest air in the room should keep coming to the radiator, and should pass away from it as soon as it is warmed. The usual vertical-loop radiator keeps warmed air in contact with most of its surface, because of the length of thc air-travel. The Leek radiator gets over this by making the travel horizontal.

The steam enters at S, and, under the combined influence of thc canted corrugations of the loops (3x) and a baffle (5) at the bottom, moves upwards by way of the furrows (3x) on the outside which is therefore the hottest part of the radiator; and the water of condensation returns down the incline of the corrugations to
