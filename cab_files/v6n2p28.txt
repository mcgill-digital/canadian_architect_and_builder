tects received no more benefits in the way of meetings or papers than were enjoyed by those living at a distance. But there was the <assoc>Architects' Guild </assoc>and the <assoc>Architectural Club</assoc>, each having fees of their own, and whose members received certain benefits. The only advantages enjoyed by city members of this Association over their brethren in the country, was that they had no railway fare to pay in coming to attend the annual meetings, and it was thought when the fees were fixed that a slight reduction in the fees of those outside might have the effect of equalizing matters in that respect.

Mr. <person>Belcher</person> said he had been under the impression that quarterly meetings were held by local members of the Association as was the case with the <assoc>Engineers' Association</assoc>. In that Association, papers were read in various towns before local branches of the organization, and then forwarded to the central society, and there discussed, and, if approved, printed and forwarded to the members of the Association generally.

The Registrar said that the suggestion made in Mr. Greg's post card, and that made by Mr<person>. Baker </person>tallied very well with a letter which appeared in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER a couple of months ago. The Association might encourage the delivery of papers on various subjects, which would he published in the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER and thus reach members who had not an opportunity of hearing them read He noticed that all the members who did not pay their fees had something to say about hard times, and it must be borne in mind that the present was undoubtedly a time of considerable depression in business, many architects having very little work. As to advantages, it was true the resident members had the advantage of access to the library, but of that they had availed themselves to a very limited extent. As a matter of fact, the country members have been far more regular in the payment of their fees than the city membersâ€”the proportion of those who had not paid in the city being as 13 to 23, or almost one half not paid, whereas in the case of outside members the proportion was as 20 to 25, a very much better showing. Times, however seemed to be improving, and some architects who wrote to him spoke of being very full of work. Something had been said in regard to civil servants. He was not convinced that they were a class who should be conceded any special privileges. They were in receipt of a salary from the country for performing certain duties, and being in that way secured in a living, were able to make plans at a very low rate, and had in several cases come into competition with members who wished to receive adequate remuneration for their services. If any reduction was made in the fees of civil servants, some provision ought to be made to protect members from that kind of thing.

Mr. <person>Gregg </person>said that after what Mr. <person>Dick </person>had said, lie would venture to ask him to second his motion, that for this year the fees of city members be reduced to $12 and those of country members to $8.

Mr. Dick regretted his inability to comply with Mr. Gregg's request ; the motion did not coincide with his views at all. He did not think that anyone sitting in the present convention was sufficiently conversant with the details of the working of the Association to be able to say what the fees should be for the coming year. If a seconded could be found for the motion, he would move that the question of fees to be paid for the coming year be left to the decision of the Council with a recommendation from the Association to make them as low as possible, consistent with the proper management of the affairs of the Association.

The President expressed himself as not in favor (If any temporary reduction of fees.,' he thought there should be a fixed and definite sum at-ranged which would carry along for at least some considerable time. The Association was not in a position to make any material reduction of the fees, and if it was the opinion of the Association there should he such reduction, the expenditure would have to be reduced.

Mr. Dick was unable to see the necessity of the fees being the same every year. He thought in a year when there was special legislation going on, or other action involving larger expenditures, the fees might be increased, and reduced again in years when no such need of the money was apparent. That plan was adopted in some of the friendly associations; in some instances the assessments for the coming year were based on last year's expenditures 

Mr. <person>Kenney</person> thought a great deal of discussion was being devoted to a matter in regard to which there was very little complaint, He thought the most expeditious way of settling the matter was to leave it in the hands of the Council.

The President said that the fact must not he lost sight of that if the amendment to the Act was secured, members coming into the Association in order to be enabled to retain the right to call themselves architects, ought to do so on a definite understanding that they would be liable for certain fees tight along. He thought it would be better to maintain a definite fee. He could understand that after running for a period of five years it might bc possible to make a reduction, but he thought it would be inadvisable to drop them from year to year on the experience of one year.

On motion of Mr. Gordon, the meeting then adjourned.



THE BANQUET.



On Wednesday evening about thirty members of the Association spent a thoroughly enjoyable time in the dining hall of

the <building>Queen's hotel </building>in connection with the annual banquet. The occasion was made as informal as possible and its enjoyability seemed thereby to be enhanced.

Among the toasts, in addition to those of a patriotic character, were the following: "<assoc>The Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc>", responded to by Messrs. <person>Gordon </person>and <person>Arnoldi

</person>"The School of Practical Science," responded to by Prof. <person>Galbraith</person> "<assoc>The Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>," responded to by Mr. <person>Langton </person>; and the CANADIAN Architect AND BUILDER," responded to by Mr. <person>C. H. Mortimer</person>. The company listened with pleasure to songs by Messrs. <person>Webster</person>, <person>Gouinlock</person>, <person>Baker</person>, <person>Belcher</person> and <person>Commander Law</person>, Mr. Belcher also giving in good style a recitation.



SECOND DAY.

The first article on the programme was the testing of some material in one of the testing machines of the School of Practical Science. A 6" x6" pine post and a 3 inch wrought iron pipe were subjected to tile test and broken. The members then assembled in the room of meeting to hear an interesting paper on "It-on Fireproof Construction in New York," sent by Mr. <person>J.C.B. Horwood</person>, a Canadian student in New York. The paper was read by Mr. <person>Edmund Burke</person>, who had had enlarged drawings made from Mr. Horwood's sketches, so that each point in the construction described was clearly illustrated. After the conclusion (If the paper, the subject was discussed at some length by the members present, the discussion occupying the remainder of the morning. The paper and the discussion thereon will be printed in a succeeding issue.



AFTERNOON SESSION.



The President : According to this Agenda, we are now to take up new business. Any member who has any new business to bring before the Association will please mention it now. You are aware the discussion of yesterday afternoon was postponed until this afternoon, and it would be as well, perhaps, to have the whole matter gone into at the same time.

Mr. Gregg then affixed to the blackboard two maps of the Province of Ontario, and explained that he had prepared them for the purpose of illustrating a suggestion he had made to the Registrar for the division of the Province, for the purposes of the Association, into districts. He thought it would be of great advantage if the country were organized into centers. For instance, in Ottawa the Association had ten members, and

in the neighborhood there	were two members.	This

would constitute dine district.	Then, in Kingston	there

are five members, and in that neighborhood, in Napanee

and Deseronto, two members.	 He would suggest	that

as the next division. The third would be Peterboro', in which there were only seven members. Then came Toronto, with seventy-two members, including Toronto Junction, and with Toronto he had connected Barrie and Owen Sound Hamilton Paris Guelph, Galt, Welland and Thorold would form another district. The London Center would comprise London, Stratford, St. Thomas, Petrolea Chatham, Ridgetown, Kingsville, Windsor and Port Elgin. This was the least satisfactory division of all, because the places were so far separated, but there were not enough members to justify the formation of two Chapters. In view of the proposed legislation, he proposed the immediate taking up of this idea in connection with making a canvass in support of the proposed amendments to the Act. For instance, upon the Ottawa center or Chapter would devolve the duty of interviewing members, not only in that county, but in Prescott, Russell, Glengarry, Stormont, Lanark and Renfrew. He thought no more efficacious plan than this could be devised for accomplishing the present object of the Association, to say nothing of what might be accomplished in other ways in the future.

Mr. <person>Paull </person>suggested the appointment of a committee, to see what could be accomplished along the proposed lines.

The President thought it would be better for the Convention, if the proposal was approved of, to make a recommendation to the Council for the division of the Province into these districts, and that they get the thing into working order. It would not do to have committees working who were not under the control of the Council, which was responsible to the Association. There was no doubt the Council would attend to it if such a recommendation was made. He thought if the divisions were constituted, they ought each to have an organization of their own, subject, of course, to the Association.

Mr. Gregg moved that the Council be requested to divide the country into districts and centers, in which meetings are to he held, such divisions to be called Chapters, and that the action be taken at once, with a view to such divisions being utilized in the canvass for the desired legislation.

Mr. Paull seconded the motion.

Mr. Belcher said he understood the proposal only to refer to the mode of obtaining the support of the various members of the Legislature in those districts.



Mr. Gregg replied that the formation of the Chapters was not for that express purpose ; his idea was that if the country ever grew, and continued to grow, the architects, draughtsmen and young men in architects' offices in these districts might form branches of the Association in these centers, having libraries and reading rooms of their own. In the meantime, until the
