THE introduction of iron and steel skeletons for the Support of large buildings is said to have lessened to a very large extent the demand for brick.



REFERRING to the illustration of the proposed new union Station at Toronto, published in this journal, the Architectural Era says . "We had the pleasure of seeing the original drawing in Toronto recently. and it seemed to us to be one of the most pleasing Compositions yet produced in the Province."





A New Hampshire granite manufacturer states that it will take ten years for the industry to regain the position which It occupied prior to the recent strike of granite Cutters. It would be interesting to know what advantage the strikers expect to derive as the result of the injury which they have been the means of inflicting upon this important industry.





THE next number of the ARCHITECT AND BUILDER Will be issued from new publication offices, Rooms 106, 107 and 108 <building>Confederation Life Association Building</building>, Richmond and Yonge streets. We shall there enjoy better facilities for the carrying on of our work, and shall be pleased to see as many of our friends as Can make it convenient to visit us.





The opinion of the citizens of St. John's, Nfld., was that the cathedral destroyed in the recent conflagration, was fire proof. Consequently when the fire broke out, the building was made the storehouse for furniture and other combustible materials. A burning ember blown through the open door set fire to these materials, and belief in the ability of the structure to withstand fire was quickly dissipated



SEVERAL accidents, some of a fatal character have lately resulted from the breaking down of derricks while under strain. There appears to be need for more careful examination of such apparatus, to give every possible assurance that It possesses the requisite strength. Equal care is required on the part of those who may be entrusted with its operation, in order that the lives of workmen may not be carelessly sacrificed.



The time has almost arrived when the <assoc>Toronto Architectural Sketch Club </assoc>should resume its regular meetings. It is to be regretted that owing to the prevailing dullness in building operations and other causes, several of the leading spirits of the organization have recently removed from the city. While the loss of these members will be severely felt, others should be found ready to take their places, and display like activity on behalf of the progress of the Club.





WHILE congratulating Messrs. <firm>Strickland & Symons </firm>upon having received the commission to prepare the plans and superintend the erection of the new union railway depot at Toronto, and the railway companies and the city upon the fact that the work has been entrusted to such capable hands, we may nevertheless point out that an opportunity existed for a most interesting competition. The subject is one which might well have engaged the thought of all the leading architects of the country. The palace hotel which It is said to be the intention of the C. P. R. to erect opposite to the new depot, might also form the subject of such a competition
