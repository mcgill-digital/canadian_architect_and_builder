<article title=" COLOURING BRICKWORK " author="">COLOURING BRICKWORK.

It is a common practice when brickwork gels dirty, after a few years exposure to the sooty atmosphere of towns, to brighten it up by applying colour washes and re-pointing. This is pernicious, for not only does it never produce the desired effect of new brickwork, but it looks what it is -- "painty" and after a year or so its appearance is worse than ever. Sometimes yellow stocks, or white Suffols and Burham bricks are actually transformed into red bricks. The pointing, too, is ludicrous ; the joinis are filled up flush, the colour-wash applied over all, and the pointing lined in according to the fancy of the workman often some-

what out of the horizontal and with imperfect perpends, and finally with the most weird conception of bonding. The suburban villa is bad enough without this sham brickwork. If it must he cleaned up, why not spend a little more time and trouble in rubbing down the surface and showing the honest substance of the real bricks ? -- English Exchange.





The second edition of <person>Dwight L. Stoddard'</person>s little book. "The Steel Square Pocket Book,' has been received recently. This presents many advantages over the first edition, as the matter has been rearranged and much of it rewritten, and some forty new illustrations added.
