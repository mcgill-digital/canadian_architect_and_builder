LONDON BUILDINGS STEREOTYPED.

A colonial visitor to England writes in the ''Builder'' his impressions of England and London from a builder's point of view, lie notes that the most remarkable feature in the vast growth of little two storey houses in the last twenty-five years is the uniformity of their plan of arrangement.

In continental centres which are developing suburbs there is a certain individuality in the small houses. Speculative houses built by the dozen are very exceptional on the continent. But in England a house built to suit the taste of an individual is so rare as to pass unnoticed among the tens of thousands of villas and cottages erected by speculative builders. He continues

As London is approached on the southern side the remarkable character of the modern English mode of living in suburban cottages is apparent. London seems to a foreigner like some monstrous overgrown village or collection of villages with interminable rows of little two storey cottages, interspersed with fields, commons and parks.

All that constituted a town or city in the old times and in the olden sense has, of course, long since been swallowed up in this gigantic layrinth, and the country thus transmogrified is inhabited by people who, to judge by the singularly stereotyped appearance of their homes. are content with its remarkable stereotyping of their domestic arrangements.''



 Many of the leading architects of the world have sent in their designs for the London County Council's new hail, which is expected to cost nearly Â£850,
