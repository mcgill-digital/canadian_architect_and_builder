This meeting has been called that your Council may report on the work done by them since the formation of the Association last October. Since our first meeting of Oct. 10th the Council have held thirteen meetings. As you are aware, it was decided at the meeting of Oct. 10th to apply for an Act of Incorporation. On the 14th we were informed that all applications for Acts of Incorporation had to be in before the 15th of October if required to be dealt with that session, so application was made at once through <person>Mr. Prefontaine</person>. The preparation of the Act was left to a committee of four, and they reported to the Council on Nov. 14th, at which meeting, after being slightly amended, it was decided to give it at once to <person>Mr. Prefontaine</person>, he to have it printed and laid before the House of Assembly.

On the 5th of December a telegram was received from Quebec saying "Bill nearly killed, arrange for deputation." That same day the Secretary saw Mr. Prefontaine, and he advised the Council to send down a strong deputation. Eight members of the Council and four members of the Association left Montreal on Dec. 9th for Quebec, and on arriving next morning went to the House of Parliament with a large number of our Quebec confreres.

On the 10th the Bill was dealt with, and after some considerable opposition, was passed. The Council and members having seen it through so far, the Montreal contingent left Quebec that same day. The Council had been advised to have <person>Mr. Delisle</person>, a lawyer of Quebec, to represent the Quebec contingent. He attended with Mr. Prefontaine and <person>Mr. Langelier </person>with the deputation before the <assoc>Private Bills Committee</assoc>.

On Dec. 8th the Secretary received a telegram asking some of the Council to go down at once. That evening six members and the Secretary went down to Quebec, On arriving they went with our Quebec confreres to the House and found the Bill would not come before the <assoc>Legislative Council Committee </assoc>before the early part of the following week. But they found out where the opposition to the Bill lay, and it was deemed advisable to have <person>Mr. Resther </person>and the Secretary remain in Quebec, they with the Quebec members to use every endeavor to have the Bill pushed through, as the session was drawing to a close. The Bill went through the Committee of the Legislative Council on the 22nd, and next day was read in the Lower House and finally sanctioned on Dec. 30th, 1890.

The Bill as sanctioned has been printed in English and French, and a copy sent to each member of the Association.

On Oct. 10th, the By-laws and constitution of the Association were adopted, then partly printed, but were stayed until the Bill had passed, as it might affect them. After the passing of the Bill your Council held a meeting on Jan. 15th to reorganize under the Act. The Council organized, electing the same officers as were elected by the members at the meeting of the Association last Oct. 10th

The by-laws were then taken in hand and left to a committee of three to look over, they to lay them before the Council at an early date. This committee reported on March 6th. After being further amended, the by-laws were adopted and sent down to Quebec fur approval. On their return they were printed in French and English and a copy sent to each member of the Association.

The Council took up the matter of the competition for the new <building>Board of Trade building</building>. That body (the building committee of the Board of Trade) not acceding to the reasonable requests made by your Council, members were requested to refrain from entering the competition. <assoc>The Ontario Association</assoc> also had some correspondence with the building committee of the Board of Trade and took similar action to our own.

A Board of Examiners has been elected to prepare papers for the forthcoming examinations should any wish to present them-

selves. The Board consists of Messrs. <firm>Berlinguet and Baillairge</firm>, of Quebec, and Messrs. <firm>Roy, Thomas and Taylor</firm>, of Montreal.

At our first annual meeting, 35 enrolled themselves as members of the Association. Since then 14 have joined, making a total of 49. One of our members, <person>M. Laurent</person>, we are sorry to say. died shortly after joining.

We shall as soon as possible get rooms for the Association, one of which will be given up to the students.

The works which the Council are prepared to go on with immediately are The engaging and furnishing of rooms, forming of a library, framing of a tariff, preparation of a form to guide competitions, papers or classes or other means of instruction for the students.

The Board of Examiners undertake the preparation of papers for examinations. All these and more we hope to accomplish before our next annual meeting in October.

It was moved by Mr. <person>J. Wright</person>, seconded by <person>Mr. Bulman</person>, that the report be received and adopted. Carried.

It was moved by <person>Mr. Browne</person>, seconded by <person>Mr. Walbank</person>, "That each member be. assessed the sum of $5.00, so that the Council may meet expenses incurred by procuring the Act of Incorporation." Carried.

It was moved by <person>Mr. Browne</person>, seconded by <person>Mr. Bulman</person>, "That a vote of thanks be given the President and officers and Council of the Association for having the Bill passed through the House, and for the time and trouble they have given for the benefit of this Association." Carried.

There being no further business the meeting closed.

<article title="personal" author="">PERSONAL.

Mr. <person>John Herbert</person>, the builder of several well-known public buildings in the city of Toronto, died in that city on the ninth.

The recent death of Mr. <person>T. J. Hibbard</person>, of the firm of <firm>H. & T. Hibbard</firm>, stone cutters, Toronto, caused widespread regret among members of the building trades throughout the city, by whom he was held in universal respect.



By the resignation of <person>Mr. Tracy</person>, City Engineer, the city of London has lost an official whose place it will be difficult to fill with equal ability. Mr. Tracy has accepted the position of City Engineer of Vancouver, B. C. and will doubtless leave the impress of his skill upon the future development of that rapidly growing and already important city.

It is a somewhat peculiar circumstance that within a period of two years the principal contractors in the erection of the two most important buildings under construction in Ontario should have been forced at the call of death to leave to other hands the completion of their undertakings. Last year the community was startled by the sudden death of Mr. <person>Lionel Yorke</person>, the contractor for the new Legislative building. During the last month Mr. Elliott, the contractor engaged in the erection of he new <building>Toronto municipal buildings</building>, succumbed to an attack of la grippe. <person>Mr. Elliott </person>was for thirty years a resident of Brantford, Ont., during which period he filled with much ability and integrity several positions of public trust and responsibility. He removed to Toronto last year, to be the better able to give his personal supervision to the great undertaking which he had assumed. <person>Mr. Elliott </person>was 69 years of age at the time of his death. The fulfillment of his contract has been assumed by his sureties.



<assoc>The Toronto Master Carpenters Association </assoc>has elected the following officers: <person>John J. Withrow</person>, President; <person>Richard Dinnis</person>, Vice-president<person>; J. C. Scott</person>, Treasurer; <person>Win. Simpson</person>, Secretary; Committee, Messrs. <person>W. Simmons</person>, <person>Geo. Moir</person>, <person>Douglas Scott</person>, <person>Win. Power </person>and <person>Win. Forbes</person>.
