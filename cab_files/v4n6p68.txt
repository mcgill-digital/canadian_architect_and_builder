of nature, the more the tendency is to render it in terms other than imitative, and the more pleasure we take in the rendering. This, its well as the fact that he renders with more truth and beauty than any other men the real life of a scene- —the grace of foliage, the varied slopes of the ground, the brightness of light, and the transparency of shade, and gives us color and composition to delight the eye -—is one great reason why we take so much pleasure in the work of Fowler. Without a word of gratitude fur <person>Fowler</person>, a criticism of Art in Ontario would not be complete but it is not our purpose to deal with individuals at all on this occasion ; otherwise, we might praise as well as criticize. But the Society his had from the enthusiastic daily papers is much glory as it needs, and our business is to point nut with a fair mind and in a public spirit, the intrinsic 11(1 of value in most of the productions. We name no names in dispraise We (10 not wish to disturb any " vested interests but if any artist who finds in our remarks an application to himself a ill take the hint, we think he will find it pay for it is worth while in conclusion to remark, in vindication of the Stripped that the Canadian public is able and willing to give to art, that any real work of art always sells, and usually without delay.

It was gratifying to see in the small room devoted to the <assoc>Architectural Sketch Club </assoc>so much promising work. The Club is now well established, and we hope the membership is full for the Club, and the association which it brings about among students, will probably be of more value to them and to the future of architecture in Ontario than can l)e adequately estimated now.

One of the oldest of the earliest architects declared that no advance in exterior coloring equal to the introduction of exterior staining, over a decade ago on the discovery of the Creosote slams, has been made in the last fifty years. This new discovery made by' the people bids fair to make as grace a resolution as the original cite.

FOR several years past the Medical Health Department of the city of Toronto has been sadly lacking- its efficiency. With the recent appointment and <person>Dr. Allen </person>its it's executive officer, an improved order of things seems to have commenced. Dr. Allen has already shown by his energetic manner of attacking abuses that he does not regard in the light if a sinecure the important position which he has been called upon to occupy. The citizens base reason to be thankful to him for his recent report on the quality of the milk supply. As the result of investigation he finds that only ten out of one hundred and fifty samples examined during the month of May, could be classed its good. Skim milk and milk highly adulterated by various methods is being supplied by most of the dealers.

[It. Allen has discovered also, what many persons have long suspected was the fact, that many of the so-called dairies are unworthy of the name by reason of their want of cleanliness, proper ventilation, and other important conditions requisite for insuring the purity of the milk.

Bad as is this condition of affairs, there is vet a worse phase of the subject presented in the Medical Health Officer's report, namely, that milk is being supplied to the citizens from cows sit afflicted with disease as to require artificial supports to keep them on their feet

This is truly in alarming condition of affairs and one which demands the application of prompt and severe remedies.
