The interior is of steel construction. consisting of steel columns supported on concrete footings and steel floor beams and roof trusses. All of this steel work will be fireproofed. using concrete, e, bricks, or terra cotta as is best suited for the work.

The steel work is a unit. in itself, and is not dependent on inferior partitions for support.

The walls of the rotunda and vaults are built of first-class brick masonry. All other interior walls are built of hollow porous terra cotta blocks and so designed that at. any time any partition or set of partitions on any floor may be removed without interfering with the construction of the building, and with a minimum interference with the business operation of any department.

The floors will be of reinforced steel concrete construction on protected steel beams, having marble and tile floor finishes.
