TOASTS.



"The Queen," "Our Country," The City of Toronto,' "The City's Industries," "The Ontario Association of Architects," "Sister Exchanges," " The Press,' " The Ladies."



After an hour had been given to considering this specification, the Chairman rose to propose the toast to Her Majesty The Queen. In doing so, he remarked that, contrary to usual custom, the builders this evening were acting as the party of the second part of the contract, there being no party of the first part on this occasion. He did not think that the party of the first part would be disposed to accuse the party of the second part of not fulfilling their obligations. He heartlly welcomed the visiting guests.

After the singing of "The National Anthem," Mr. Christie rose to propose the second toast, that of

Our Country," coupling therewith the names of the local representatives in parliament, Messrs. Clarke and Crawford. Mr. Christie in proposing the toast, referred to the fact that Canada had at last taken her proper position in relation to the Empire by sending a contingent of her soldiers to South Africa. This position Canada should have taken long ago. The Dominion was destined to be the strong right arm of the Empire.

Following Mr. Christie's remarks, the Canadian national anthem, The Maple Leaf," was heartily sung by the company. Owing to the non-arrival of Mr. Clarke, Mr. Crawford first responded to the toast, and in doing so referred to the wealth possessed by Canada in the form of mines, fisheries, and forests. Her possessions of this character were greater than those of any other country of the same population. Canadians could boast also of their connection with the great British Empire. He referred to our excellent system of government which is so planned as to work out to the best advantage of the people. He trusted that the growth of the Builders' Exchange would keep pace with the " growing time."
