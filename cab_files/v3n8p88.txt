The meeting adjourned.

The above is a formal record of the business transacted by the Council, It does not, however, represent the work actually accomplished, as many matters were discussed in an informal manner with the object of placing the members in a position to give more attention to business which will be brought up at the next meeting of the Council, The Council sat all day and spent very little time in useless discussion. The Council thought it would be better for the first year to combine the registration and annual fees in one fee. The fee was placed as low as possible, but at the same time at a sufficient sum to meet all expenses. The Association has to provide for the payment of about $125 in obtaining the Act and the cost of administra- ation, examinations and sundry other expenses, and also the accumulation of a fund to be devoted to the education of students and draughtsmen. No accurate estimate can be made of the number of architects who will register.
