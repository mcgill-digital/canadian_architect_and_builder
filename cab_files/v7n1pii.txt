 MALCOLM'S 

Pateilt Sallitary Wash Basin

This Wash Basin does not give the disagreeable

and unhealthy odor that comes from the overflow of

all other wash basins in the market. The overflow is from the bottom of the basin and being trapped at that point, completely stops the smell that would otherwise arise It is neater and better than any other in the market Gall and see it at our



show rooms, 89 and 91 Church Street, Toronto.

Registered No 20/4741.



I N consequence of the great popularity of this Closet, we find I that imitations are being made and sold as the Richelieu, though



decidedly inferior to the genuine article



The "Richelieu" Closets made by us are stamped as above, in addition to our "Trade MARK," and as the name "Richelieu"

is registered in the Department of Agriculture, we shall take immediate action against any one stamping the name " Richelieu" on any closet, or having in. possession closets so stamped that are not of our manufacture.
