<article title="The T. Eaton & Co.'s Store at Winnipeg" author="">THE T. EATON & CO'S STORE AT WINNIPEG.



The new departmental store at Winnipeg was opened on July 16th, ten days less than a year from the day on which the first sod was turned for its excavation. The day for its opening was fixed from the start and the time was kept.

The building has a 266 feet frontage with space in the block to double that length when needed. The building is five storeys in height but the foundations and steel framework are said to be calculated for double this height.

The type of design is perfectly utilitarian; vertical and horizontal framing with protection and the remaining surface all glass. There are nevertheless 1,000,000 bricks and 7,000 barrels of cement included in the structure.

Automatic sprinklers are installed within the building and a water screen without. To feed these there is a private well and two pumps of a capacity of 3,000,000 gallons a day.

Thc most modern equipments are arranged inside: a rest room, fur-checking room, counting room, public telegraph and telephone stations, and a bureau of information regarding trains.
