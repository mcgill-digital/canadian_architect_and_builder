J N a private letter to the editor of this journal, Mr.

Geo. H. Wolfe, publisher 'of the California Architect, says: "There is not so much difference in construction between this place and your own as you would imagine. Our better class of houses are all diagonally boarded. On this is nailed tar paper and then rustic. Our rustic is somewhat similar to your weather boarding principle. . Thermometer in this city never gets below 200 above zero, and only in exceptionable instances does it get as low as that, How our buildings would stand your climate, of course, is a problem. Nine

 We

 should judge that it was the intention of the author r of this' design to face his house south. If such' is the case, the plan would be very much improved if it were reversed, so as to place the-rooms now on the west side on the east. The east and street exposure'-' is-" the most--valuable,- and yet the author has placed the reception hall, staircase and kitchen on this side of his house, and the dining and parlor on the west. The dining-room should always when possible have an east exposure, and should never be placed on the west side, the parlor, although its position is not very important, should always be placed in the best available one. In this case it has been placed on the west side, away from a street, when. it could equally well have been placed on the east side, and next the street. The staircase can go anywhere, but should never be placed where it would be much' better to have a room. The inhabi4

tenths of our buildings are built entirely of wood, chimneys alone excepted. It is not until lately that brick have come into general use for foundations for frame dwellings." ___________________







We understand the Secretary of the Toronto Board of Trade' has received letters from more than a score of American architects informing him of their intention to enter the competition for the Board of Trade building.

If the University authorities and the Government of Ontario should decide to establish a chair of Architecture in connection, with the Schoot of Practical Science, Toronto, we hope to see it tilled by a Canadian professor. We have among us architects who have had the  training to qualify them to discharge the duties of such a position with honor to themselves and advantage to the students who should look to them for instruction, In the past there has been too much going abroad after men to fill positions of this kind. This country has now reached the stage where native talent may justify claim

-— and should receive proper consideration. 

tants of a house do not live in the balls nor in the stair- way, but they do live in the rooms, and consequently the rooms should be placed in the better position. The kitchen would have answered every purpose if placed on the west side, thus giving place to the dining room. Then, again, the dining rooms are placed on the most exposed side of the house, where it is most difficult to keep them warm. How would it be possible to keep the. dining rooms warm in cold weather, exposed as it is to the Northwest winds. The reception hall is too large and important for a. house of this size and value, and moreover, has too many windows.. No vestibule, bas been provided, which is a most serious objection. . This climate is much too severe to have but one door closed against it -two is none too many. A vestibule could easily have been secured by narrowing the opening to porch, and, placing a door close to the joint of window to. parlor Then the little windows at the side of this arch would have been of some service, if enlarged to be of some use. A house of the pretensions of this one should not be without a pantry. There is a small closet through
