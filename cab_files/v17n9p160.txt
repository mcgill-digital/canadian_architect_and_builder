The Engineering News has found eighty-two gas plants supplying heat to customers through a distributing system. Fourteen of them have central heating systems. The Progressive Age says in regard to this list, that "Although there is a great deal of head-shaking going on over gas companies entering other lines of business, yet the fact remains that if a product can be sold it should not be thrown away. This holds good not only for residuals, but for waste heat and Steam, and coke breeze as well. Through the flues and up the chimneys of gas-works go many millions of heat units which might be sold at a profit if a way were found to put them into marketable form. We pay money for heat units, and when we waste heat units we waste money. Whether we are compelled to spend as much as we will save depends upon the method, but the success or otherwise of these central heating plants will solve a very important problem in public supplies and private economies.
