Trenches for footings, etc., are measured by their superficial dimensions multiplied by the depth and price per cubic yard as before.

For pier and post holes allow double measurement, that is, if a pier hole figure up 96 cubic feet, allow 192 feet, or 7 1/2 cubic yards at price per yard  before.

In finding the solid contents or an angular excavation, as for bay windows, etc., the surest method is to take a square outside dimension of the whole, or if it be possible, to form rectangles of the plan, after the manner seen in the sketch, and to multiply by the depth for solid contents. Allow at least 25 per cent above actual cost, as more labor is required in hacking and digging angles. and this percentage will cover it. They come under the arithmetical heading of the triangle and if it be required to find the exact contents of an angular bay, or in other words. the number of cubic feet of earth which must be taken out to allow its entry, the following method can be gone through Divide the figure into triangles, and find the area of each separately, by multiplying the base by half the altitude. Thus, supposing Fig. 2 to be the plan of a hay window, divide it into three triangles

as shown, and taking one side of each as the base, bisect it, and join the point of bisection with the opposite angle. Measure the joining line, and then multiply the whole length of the base by half the length of the joining line, and the result will be the area, thus :—A bay window 12 feet long, 6 feet across the front, and 3 feet deep. Then 6 ft. x ft. 6 in. =9 square feet x 3=18 square feet x by the depth, 9 feet= 162 cubic feet. Add the sums of the three areas together and multiply with the depth of the excavation, as In a square excavation, and the result will be the contents in cubic feet, which divided by 27, will give the number of yards desired.

ROM the records in the City Commissioner's office, we have prepared the following statement showing the number of building permits granted for the first six months of the present year. compared with the number granted for a similar period in 1888. The statement is prepared with a view to showing the class and value of the buildings which are being erected. It is interesting to note that. exclusive of the new <building>Board of Trade building, </building>to cost $300000. and fur which no permit appears to have been obtained, the value of new buildings for which permits have been granted this year. exceeds those of last year by upwards of $100,000. The amount spent on residences this year is $200,000 in excess of 1888 and there is a large reduction in number of cheap, rough-cast houses. Below are the figures:

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



DEAR SIR,—AS one who has a genuine desire to advance all branches of art in Canada, I ask your permission to occupy a short space in your columns for the purpose of making public a few thoughts which have suggested themselves to me on the subject of a recent sculpture. Criticism is at all times apt to appear ungracious, but those to whom the onward progress of art is clear, can understand the motives which prompt this letter.

A few weeks ago there was unveiled in Toronto a bronze statue of Dr. <person>E. Ryerson</person>, who was so widely known to fame, and whose memory is probably destined to survive many of those whose deeds were more showy but less useful.

A man of plain, determined, weighty and beneficent career, and who possessed such individuality, should be a subject which a true sculptor would have no difficulty in grasping and transferring to the clay.

With your permission, I will point out what may be considered serious defects in the execution of the statue.

The pose is effective and natural, the garb becoming, the accessories suitable, but going into details, noticing a rather large amount of conventionality of treatment, one can but notice the sad lack of artistic feeling. Surely the talented Doctor did not possess so huge a head, so out of proportion to the frame. Massive and square it certainly was, the hair abundant and the aspect benevolent but determined, yet the writer's personal recollection is that most decidedly Dr. Ryerson possessed a well balanced and finely proportioned figure, the head by no means predominating as in this bronze.

The hands are simply terrible, one of the ill-assorted pair not only larger than the other, but the extended right hand, reversing nature and the traditions of art, shows that the index finger was at least a half diameter thicker than the others. Is this designed " au naturel" or shall we look upon it as a conventionalized representation of the mighty finger which guided the pen ? If the latter, the fashion of naming the object considered necessary in the dawn of art had better be made use of; so that there shall be no danger of future Canadians exhuming this work and imagining that their ancestors were so singularly formed.

While on this subject of proportions, I cannot disabuse my mind of the idea that the feet, limbs, trunk and head belonged to a diversity of people, for most assuredly the feet don't fit the legs, the legs the body, nor the body the bead. Throwing around such a trunk the flowing robe of a D.D. does not conceal this disproportion, and in no particular way helps the picturesqueness, whilst the tame modelling of the drapery is made more conspicuous.

Nothing in the way of accessories is so hard to arrange naturally and gracefully as drapery, either in painting or sculpture, and yet, with what pleasure can the eye dwell on the efforts of the early fathers of art—the revivalists to whom we owe so much In early examples, failure in drapery is most rare—in latter days, the rule, perhaps because we are so particular about each particular hair that the garb must be left in slovenly modelling. The example under notice appears not only thin and harsh and hard, but a graceful fold or line can with difficulty be picked out. Compare, for instance, the graceful lines imparted to that ungraceful garment, a frock coat, as set out in the George Brown statue in Queen's Park—every wrinkle, fold and crease is intelligible and natural.

A very serious error, and one which the most ignorant modeller should have avoided, is that of making the pedestal on which rest the books, overhang the circular base to such an extent as to give an impression that one touch would upset the lot.

As such laudatory notices appeared in the local press, I was anxious to get a calm study of the subject, hoping that the attention not only of artists, but also of the public, might be engaged to forward thc cause of art by intelligent criticism, and
