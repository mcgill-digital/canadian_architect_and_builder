THE WINDSOR PLASTER Co.

The works of this company, situated at Windsor, Nova Scotia, are Irons two to five stories in height and cover a floor arc-a of 43,000 square feet. In 1893 the company commenced the manufacture of calcined land plaster, and the year following began time production of English Selenite Cement for plastering walls and ceilings. This material has been favorably received and largely used by architects and builders throughout the Dominion. THE RELATION OF WALL PAPER TO DISEASE.

Some of the Master Painters' Associations of the United States are calling the attention of city councils and local Boards of Health, to the necessity for a regulation forbidding the hanging of wall paper without previously removing the old paper front the wall - Many cases of infectious and other diseases are said to be traceable to the

practice of covering up old wail paper with new. There is a regulation in New York which prevents time re-paper ing without first cleaning the walls, but it applies only to tenement houses. It is no doubt particularly applicable to houses of this character, and if so, would seem to be also necessary in the interests of time public health, for buildings of all kinds where paper is employed as a wall covering. Not only should the old paper be removed from the walls it every instance before new paper is hung, but walls should always be washed with carbolic acid or other disinfectant.







If you are looking for a high grade Finish for Floors



Granitine HOOP Finish

Is unsurpassed in Durability and Beauty of Finish for Natural Wood and Parquette Floors, Linoleums, Oil Cloth, Cork Matting, &c.

Its transparency reveals the gram of the wood, and its preserving qualities increase the life of the floor.

Its sanitary properties are highly commended, as it closes thoroughly the pores of the wood against disease germs, and permits the floor to be kept thoroughly clean.



It is easier applied, more durable, makes better finish than wax preparations, and is free from all unpleasant slipperiness.



Moving furniture or boot heels do not leave white marks ; nor does soap, mud or water destroy its fine appearance.
