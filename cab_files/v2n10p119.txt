I made a discovery, a few days ago," said <person>J. J. Wade</person>. " I find that we have been putting our tanks too far above the bowl of the closet. We have been placing them seven feet apart and it should be only six feet. I find that the water goes out with too much force, thus making too much noise, and sucking the valve down into position too quick, and making a sounding noise, which instead of disappearing with the long use of the tank, becomes worse. It makes more noise, does not act as well, and does not give any helter flush You take my tank here, and it is perfectly noiseless—not making any noise when the water goes on or when it goes out. Hereafter I will put them up only six feet, and no higher.—Sanitary Plumber.
