A NEW STONE ELEVATOR 

The Engineering and Mining Journal for August 4th describes the Jeffrey stone elevator for the handling of crushed stone, ore, broken coal, and similar materials. An illustration shows the elevator used in connection with a stone crusher, receiving the product directly from the delivery chute of the crusher and discharging it into a revolving screen at the top. The elevator is constructed of two strands of steel chain covered completely with a continuous line of buckets, which prevents the gritty material from coming in contact with the chain and the other principal wearing parts of the machinery, thus greatly increasing its life. The buckets are made of heavy steel with riveted seams, in sizes to suit the capacity. The peculiar shape of these buckets makes it possible to operate the elevator at a very slow speed, at the same time effecting a cleaner discharge than is produced by high-speed machines, to say nothing of the saving of wear and tear. At suitable intervals wrought-iron cross-bars are attached to the chain, carrying rollers at each end, extending outside of the buckets, which support the weight of the chain, bucket, and the material ; this causes a roller friction, reducing the strain on the machinery to a minimum and requiring the least possible amount of power.





Here are a few facts about the Chicago Masonic Temple: The frame of the building is of steel bolted together, 4,700 tons of steel having been used. The walls are of stone and pressed brick with marble and bronze trimmings and terra cotta partitions, 2,200 tons of the latter entering into the work. There are eighty-eight miles of electric -wiring, and the plate glass would, if laid flat on The ground cover four acres. The pumping apparatus used in running the battery of fourteen elevators would easily supply water for a city of 6o,ooo souls. The elevators run at a rate of nine miles an hour and each elevator runs every year 123,136 miles. There are twenty-one stories and on the top floor is an observatory and roof garden.
