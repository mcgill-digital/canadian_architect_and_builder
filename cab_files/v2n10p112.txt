to prevent any overcharge being made in respect of them. He must allow of no claim for extras,— that nightmare that disturbs the first dreams of every one who contemplates building, and haunts him till its completion—where an intelligent comparison of plans and specifications, and the evident purpose and intention of both, will allow of none. But such alterations as have taken place by written authority or agreement, he must value at a fair and reasonable price, in proportion to the original contract sum, adding to or deducting from that amount as the case may be. And here it may be said, in passing, if a system of tendering for buildings by bills of quantities were adopted in Canada, similar to that which exists in Great Britain, a great deal of unpleasantness would be avoided, and a much more satisfactory and equitable result arrived at, in the settlement of building accounts.

It will be quite apparent from what has already been stated, that some very important duties of an architect have not been touched upon. But as they fall more within the sphere of his relation to the contractor, it will be better to deal with them in another paper.

RRANGEMENTS are being completed by the officers of the above Association for the first annual convention to be held in Toronto on Wednesday and Thursday, Nov. 21st and 22nd. The place of meeting has not been definitely decided upon, but will probably be the Canadian Institute building.

In addition to the opening address of the President, interesting reports may be looked for from the Committees entrusted with the furtherance in various directions of matters affecting the interests of the profession, with the discussions consequent thereupon also the reading of papers on "Professional Ethics," by Mr. <person>Edmund Burke </person>"Competitions," and "The Relations of Architects to their Clients," Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, "Ventilation," Mr. <person>D. B. Dick </person>"<person>H. H. Richardson </person>and his Work," Mr. <person>W.

A. Langton </person>"Foundations," Mr. <person>H. B. Gordon</person>; "Office Management," Mr. <person>R. W. Gambier-Bousfield.</person>

This meeting should be made a success if it requires the efforts of every member towards that end. The question of incorporation will come up and surely every member is sufficiently interested in that matter alone to cause him to give some thought to it and bring him to Toronto to take a hand in the discussion. It is proposed to give ample time for the thorough discussion of the proposed Bill, as the views of every member is desired. It is hoped that the members outside of Toronto will take sufficient interest in this convention to take an active part. So far no papers have been volunteered by any but Toronto men. In fact letters have been addressed to the Directors living out of Toronto asking them to assist in obtaining papers, and so far they have not even acknowledged their receipt. We do not understand their apathy, and must certainly hold them guilty of neglecting their duties. The Toronto men do not wish to manage or run the whole affair, but if they cannot receive any assistance even when they take the trouble to ask for it, they must not be blamed if they seem to be the controlling and energizing influence of the Association. Action speaks with much greater force than loud or continued talking. Let us work before this meeting and do the talking at the meeting.

The social features of the occasion are not being overlooked. They will include a dinner and a drive to the principal points of interest in the city. Architects from cities and towns outside of Toronto will not be asked to contribute anything towards defraying the cost of entertainment. We desire to draw the attention of members again to the exhibition of drawings which it is proposed to hold while the convention is in session. Drawings of meritorious work, whether new or old, are earnestly

solicited. A considerable number of the resident architects have signified their intention to contribute sketches to this exhibition, but the number of such offers from outside points is not what the management would desire. We would urge every architect who can do so to contribute to make this exhibition a success, and to correspond immediately with the Secretary of the Association on the subject. We look forward hopefully to a largely attended, pleasant and profitable gathering on the occasion of the approaching convention.



<article title="Correspondence - A Kindly Invitation" author="">A KINDLY INVITATION.

CINCINNATI ARCHITECTURAL. CLUB,

CINCINNATI, Oct. 7th, 1889.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER

DEAR SIR,—I send enclosed copies of circular, etc., issued in connection with the proposed National Exhibition of Architectural Drawings and Sketches, to be held in this city contemporaneously with the joint convention of the American Institute and Western Association of Architects. As you see in our circular, the exhibition is open to receive contributions from Canada as well as the United States, and I certainly hope that our Canadian brethren will not be backward in making use of this invitation. On the 16th of last month I sent copies of these circulars to the Secretary of the <assoc>Architectural Draughtsmen's Association of Toronto</assoc>, but we have received no reply or notice of their intentions. To you, therefore, as the recognized organ of the profession in Canada, we would entrust our interest in the collection of an exhibit that will do credit to your city at least. You should understand that contributions are not confined solely to the individual works of draughtsmen but may also include the efforts of all practising and egitirnate architects. As you will notice, we pay all costs for transportation, hanging and returning, and in addition we purpose to insure all drawings while in our possession, The responsibility of the Express Co. is practically sufficient insurance during transportation.

From the American Architect we have noticed and followed the organization and development of the Ontario Association of Architects. Why can't we get them, as an Association, to undertake a collection of drawings from among their members to enter our lists? Please urge this matter for us, and do what you can. If it would be of any interest to your readers to know who are going to contribute, I could arrange to keep you generally posted. Meantime, I can give the names of the following artists who have already notified us of their intention to forward contributions From Boston—water-colors from <person>R. S. Peabody</person>, <person>C. Howard Walker, </person><person>R. Clifton Sturgis</person>, <person>C. H. Blackall</person>; pen and ink from 1). <person>A. Gregg</person>, <person>F. H.

Yours very truly,	<person>G. W. E. FIELD</person>,

Pres. C. A. C.

We beg to assure the <assoc>Architectural Club of Cincinnati </assoc>that the members of the profession in Toronto, and we venture to say throughout Canada, reciprocate heartily the fraternal feeling so clearly manifest in the above letter. They esteem it an honor to be accorded the privilege of representation at the forthcoming National Exhibition of Architectural Drawings. Unfortunately, however, circumstances render it impossible for Canada to be represented on this occasion. The annual convention of the Ontario Association of Architects will take place simultaneously with the joint convention to be held at Cincinnati, and arrangements have also been made for an exhibition of Architectural drawings during the two days of the convention. It will thus be seen that Canadian architects are debarred from availing themselves of the invitation so kindly tendered them by their American brethren. At some future time they hope to be in a position to do so. Another serious obstacle in the way of Canadian architects who may desire to send drawings to the United States is the trouble and annoyance encountered in connection with customs departments of both countries.—EDITOR C. A. & B.
