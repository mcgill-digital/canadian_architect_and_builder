grade—absolutely important. It is as important that the cement be good as in the Mannesman tube rolling process the steel be of the highest class to make a success of the actual working of the plant.

So, too, the sand should be clean it must be pure Silica. Taking all the known methods of grinding up to the time of Smidth & Co.'s discovery, and it was impossible to grind by any known means to such a degree as is requisite for the successful making of sandcement. They invented the tube mill, and in order to give a proper understanding of it, I will briefly describe same

It is a cylinder 25 ft. long, 48 in. to 50 in. diameter, lined with cast iron plates, revolving at the rate of about 6o revolutions a minute. The tube itself is tilled halt full of flint pebbles. The pebbles are brought from Norway and delivered in Canada, and in all parts of the world where they are working under these patents.

The clinker is fed at a uniform rate into the tube mill. As it  through the length of the mill revolving, it hammers itself together, the clinker and the balls revolving and pounding it, until they are ground to such a degree that the Portland cement ground, in this way, will leave not more than oresidue on the 10,000 sieve and not more than 20 to 2521656n the 40,000 sieve. Now that is about the practice required to grind Portland cement. When we mix sand arid cement in equal proportions, we can now grind all of the cement to an impalpable degree of fineness, so you cannot find it on any known sieve, and the sand itself will be reduced to such a degree that not more than 4residue will be left on a 10,000 sieve, and not more than 8 to 10residue will be left on a 40,000 sieve. Consequently we now have every particle of active cement material in the cement acting upon a sharp, finely ground portion of silica.

In itself that minute particle of silica is stronger than any corresponding minute particle of Port laud cement. The cement flour rubs around that particle of silica and has something to grip to, a sharp fi tie particle of silica. That is perhaps the explanation of the action of sandcement, and why it is that when you make a mortar com posed say of' Portland cement and ordinary commercial sand in the proportion of 3 to , that if you take that same Portland cement t and grind one part sand with it, and mix his sand cement in the proportion of 3 to 1, and test in the testing machine, the sand cement will beat the original cement from which it was made, and with corresponding economy to the consumer.



Of course, as engineers, in order that our clients may get the benefit of sandcement, we should satisfy ourselves by standard tests that the material is suitable for the work in hand, and then specify that sandcement will be accepted ed. Thus the client will get the benefit otherwise the contractor will get the benefit of it, and lie generally does, because lie will bring his cement and place it before the engineer, who will test it and get the best results, and of' course that is all he has to do with it, and the contractor is pocketing the profit.



On this continent probably the largest consumption of sand cement has been by the firm controlled by General William Sooysmith. On one contract 10,000 bbls. in the great cathedral of St. John the Divine, in tile city of New York, was used.

I will read a test made by Prof. I-I. T. Bovey, at McGill University, Montreal

To satisfy himself upon this matter, Mr. Henry C. Bamber, F.I.C., of London, England, selected a sample of English Portland cement without t revealing its identity and packed it in hart-ohs sealed and sent to the Sand Cement Works at Denmark, of

Homan Smith & Co. The seals were then broken in the presence of Mr. Bamber.

The English cement was sifted in

The sand content was made from usual oh can sea sand. The sandcement left about 3 p. c. residue on 200 sieve 40,000 sq. iii. The



proportions of' sand, cement and water were taken by weight. The water used was chilled rain water.

With reference to ibis experiment No. 3 it is of interest to note that the countless experiments made with sand cement : 2 and : 2 3 which both contain 11 parts of sand to one cement have proved that they are almost identical in respect of strength Accordingly the sand cement 1 2 selteut used for mortar with 3 parts sand us superior to Neat cement mrs d with tile same amount of sand.



We use this way of indicating the mixture of a mortar as e. g.

3 : 2, meaning One sand cement 1 : 3 with h 2 parts coarse sand as sand cement t i : 3 contains 0110 part cement + 3 of sand ground together r m : : 2 mortar- will to each part cement have 3 of ground sand arid 8 of coarse sand or ii parts of sand altogether.

This shows hue investigation of an eminent  English Client who has been giving the quest ion of cement considerable study and is associated with the firm known as K. B. & S. English Portland Cement

Mr. Walker I would like to ask the cost of that, what the price of it is ?

Mr. Butler : I think it is about. 10 cents to cents per barrel less than that of Portland cement.

Mr. X'aiuhuuiskirk What portion of sand is in the cement in Canada?

iXIr. Ilmither One such one by weight—that is to say the sand content itself is made up of 100 lbs. of Portland cement and 100 lbs. of dried sand.

Mr. Vanbuskirk : I had some sand cement tenders the other clay, but I would not accept any because that was not Itlaini.

Mr. Butler: We are putting the cement in such shape that you are getting more use out of what cement is there, and when you realize that every barrel is practically 252f sand anyway—if you realize the fact, that inhitestion does not arise.
