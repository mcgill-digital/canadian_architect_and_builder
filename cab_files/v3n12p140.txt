Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



SIR,—Will you allow me to ask you a question about house planning? The November issue of your journal contains a view with plan attached of a villa at St. Hyacinthe, P.Q. Do you think it is a good thing to have a toilet room with a water closet and bath in it placed in the centre of the house, opening only out of the reception room—apparently one of the best rooms in the house. The architects do not show how this closet and bath are to be lighted or ventilated. It can hardly be from the roof, as the roof over it is the highest part of the building. There is a borrowed light from the kitchen, but I should think it was not advisable to ventilate a water closet only into a kitchen.

One other point strikes me. The bath is so enclosed behind The w. c. partition that a bather can get in only at one-half of the bath, and this bathroom is lighted by a borrowed light into the reception room. There are many students who would like to know more about this plan than is shown here. Perhaps the architects would give us some particulars?

	Yours, etc.,	"JUNIOR."

</assoc>A

WELL-ATTENDED meeting of this club took place on Tuesday evening, Nov. 2 5th, when an instructive paper on "Mouldings" was read by Mr. <person>R. W. Gambier-Bousfield</person>,

A.R.I.B.A.	To make his paper more consistent, Mr. Bousfield had prepared a number of diagrams showing the formation and tracing the development of mouldings in the various styles. At the close of the paper a hearty vote of thanks was tendered the lecturer for the amount of time and labor he had given the subject.

Mr. <person>Frank Darling </person>then criticized the competitive drawings for "A Cottage by the Sea," pointing out the merits and defects of each design in such a way that many useful points were obtained by those present. He thinks that a verandah, instead of running narrowly round the greater part of a building, should be of less length and wider; it would then give more room for persons to sit in groups without impeding traffic, would be useful for open air meals, and in every way more suitable for a summer cottage. The desirability of keeping the kitchen as separate as possible from the main building was emphasized, also the need of having some access to the kitchen otherwise than

through dining-room. This is one of the most successful competitions the club has had; twenty very creditable designs being sent in. The authors of the three best designs are as follows First place, <person>T. R. Johnson</person>; second, <person>Ernest Wilby</person>; third, <person>Chas. Lennox</person>. A noticeable feature in the competition was a design sent in by an amateur member of the Club.

The subject of the next competition is "A Window in Some Distinctive Style"; size of openings 9 ft. x 12 ft.; drawings to be sent in by Jan. 24, 1891.

On Tuesday, the 9th inst., the Club met at the Public Library, and by the courtesy of <person>Mr. Bain</person>, examined the architectural and other art books contained in the reference department.

The reading class, conducted by Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, which meets every Monday evening, has started with a very good attendance. Clark's Building Superintendence is the first book taken up, and it is proposed to work conjointly therewith on <person>D. C. Berg</person>'s "Safe Building."





<article title="Publications" author="">PUBLICATIONS.

Canada's illustrated paper, the Dominion Illustrated, is greatly improved under its new management. The Christmas Number, kindly sent us by the publishers, is of a high character in paint of letterpress and illustration, and as a purely Canadian production, does credit to the country as well as to the enterprise of the publishers.

The Christmas edition of the Cosmopolitan Magazine is one hundred thousand copies. The order, as originally given to the printers, was for 85,000 copies, but while on the press it was thought advisable to increase the number to 100,000. It contains a feature never attempted before by any magazine, consisting of 123 cartoons from the brush of Dan Beard, the now famous artist, who did such wonderful illustrations in Mark Twain's book, The Yankee at the Court of King Arthur."

To Mr.<person>. James Acton</person>, the publisher of the Canadian Shoe and Leather Journal, is due the credit of having produced the largest and handsomest special number of a trade journal ever published in Canada. In addition to upwards of 200 pages of letter press and engravings of the principal Canadian cities, leading leather manufactories, wholesale and retail shoe stores, etc., it contains more than one hundred portraits of representative men in the trade throughout Canada. The typography throughout, as well as the many-colored lithographed covers in which it is enclosed, is of a high order. The extensive advertising patronage bestowed upon this number speaks well for the enterprise of the Canadian shoe and leather trades, who evidently have discovered that in judicious advertising is to be found one of the most important secrets of business success.
