A company has applied to Congress for leave to lay underground pipes in the streets of Washington, the U.S. capital, for the purpose of distributing cool air through residences and business establishments. The air will be pumped through a refrigerating plant.



To canvass a room cover the matchboards with strong calico known as Bolton twill, fastening all round the edges with copper tacks an inch or two apart. Stretch as tightly as possible. When fixed, apply a coat of very strong size. For a good job the calico should he interlined before putting on the wall paper.



THE British Fire Prevention Committee are organizing a novel demonstration in the form of a fire-proofing section in connection with the Biennial Building Trades Exhibition at the Agricultural Hall, London, in April. A large gallery has been retained for exhibits showing progress made in combating fire by improved materials and systems of construction. This exhibition will not not only be the first of its kind in any country, but will show that the reduction of fire risk by improved forms of building has now its own independent industrial position, claiming not only the attention of professional men but the study of our local authorities.
