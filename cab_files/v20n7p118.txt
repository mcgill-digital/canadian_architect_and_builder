NEW Physics BUILDING OF THE UNIVERSITY OF Toronto DARLING AND PEARSON, Toronto, ARCHITECTS.



The new Physics Building, now nearing completion, is situated just south of the recently opened Convocation Hall, The exterior is designed simply and broadly in a free treatment of classic architecture. The base of the building is richly rusticated, and the upper. portion is built of light buff brick with stone trimmings:

The central feature of the front is the large circular Lecture Theatre. The high windows and coupled Ionic columns, which extend from the base to the cornice, indicate the interior arrangement of the room. At the north and south ends, flanking this circular bay, are two pavilions, one storey lower than the main building. The one to the north, marked by pilasters, contains the smaller lecture hall, while the one at the south has the library above, and also a. small lecture room below The library front is ornamented with a large French window with a circular pediment.

These three features, which admit of elaboration, have been placed as advantageously as possible. The remainder of the building has been treated very simply with large window openings to provide the best possible facilities for laboratory work.

The 'addition of this building to the University of Toronto will give the city the most fully equipped physical laboratory on the continent.

Ground Floor.—The building is planned on the unit basis, so that the brick partitions between the various rooms can be taken down and rebuilt to suit any future extension that the faculty may require. All floors, with the exception of corridors, which are of concrete, are semi-fireproof, slow-burning mill construction. The outside walls are built with a 2 inch air space, and with the exception of the two lecture rooms, which are plastered, the brick lining forms the interior finish.

On entering the building through the two main entrances, which are situated in the north and south of the circular bay, two wide marble stairways and an elevator give access to the various floors.

On this floor is the large lecture room (No. 126). In order that there may be no delay in clearing this room after a lecture, three outside entrances have been provided, in addition to openings from the central corridor. Seating accommodation has been provided for about five hundred. Across the corridor, Room

No. 123 will be arranged with cases to exhibit the various apparatus.

In the northeast corner is the smaller lecture room, which will seat about two hundred students.

First Floor.—On this floor two entrances to the large lecture room gallery have been provided. This gallery is supported on cantilevers, so that there is nothing to obstruct the view of the experimental table.

The library is placed in the southeast corner, and the remaining floor area is mainly devoted to research

laboratories.



Second Floor.—The second, floor is given up to elementary physics and research work. The possibility of a future addition to the present building has been provided for in the two rear wings, which are planned so that they can be extended westward as many units as may be necessary.
