ON a May 25th, the city of St. John, The St. John Fire. N.B., was again visited by fire, which

destroyed some 200 buildings in the north end of the city known as India town, and left one thousand persons homeless. The burned district consisted principally of wooden buildings occupied by workmen connected with the saw mills and other industries of the city. There was a stiff breeze blowing at the time, which carried the sparks in all directions, resulting in the fire spreading to such a degree as to make it impossible for the firemen to check its progress.

The new scale of wages will range from 22½ cents to 27'2 cents per hour, according to the ability of the workman. The Exchange has now under consideration a request from the Journeyman Plasterers for a slight
