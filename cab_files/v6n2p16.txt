	16	THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND	February, 1893



possibility of expensive complications. Before the publication of our March number the Courts will probably be engaged on the evidence in the dispute between the architect and the contractor.



THE third annual convention of the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects</assoc>, the proceedings of which in extenso are printed in this paper, was the most important that has taken n place since the time of organization. Questions of vital importance to the welfare and even to the existence or the Association called for consideration. One of the most important related to the dissatisfaction of the country members, as expressed in their petition to the Council, with the amount of the annual fees. In the petition referred to they pointed to the surplus of nearly $2,00 standing to the credit of the Association in the bank, as evidence that the fees. were unnecessarily high. Another question of much importance was that concerning the action which should be taken to induce the Ontario Legislature to amend the Architects' Act by striking out the word "registered" which at present appears in the Act in conjunction with the word "architect." In an ably constructed opening address the President considered at length these and other matters affecting the Association, and suggested the manner in which he thought they should be dealt with. The comprehensive and reasonable views expressed in this address, coupled with the fact that all reports concerning matters to be brought before the convention were, for the first time, placed in the hands of members in printed form at the opening of the meeting, had, no doubt, much to do with the very full and intelligent discussions which followed, and with, as we believe, the wise conclusions arrived at. . It is somewhat difficult to account for the fact that only a small proportion of those who petitioned for a reduction in the fees were present at the convention to take part in the consideration of the question which they had been the means of introducing. There is every reason to expect that the conclusion reached with regard to this matter, will prove to them satisfactory, but should it unfortunately be otherwise, they should have no difficulty in deciding that to their own neglect is due the blame. The fees as altered would seem to be as low as could be adopted without impairing the financial standing of the Association. Time will no doubt prove the wisdom of the decision to fix the fees at definite amounts for every year rather than allow them to fluctuate from year to year according to circumstances. As to the return which outside members may receive for the fees which they are called on to pay, the benefits to be derived from a liberal use of the Association Library should alone be considered worth the expenditure. The additions which the Council have been authorized to make to the Library will render it increasingly valuable, and members would do well to take advantage of it to a greater than formerly. The result of the steps which are being taken to secure the amendment of the Architects' Act in the particular already mentioned, will be awaited with no little anxiety, as upon It must largely depend the future success and usefulness of the organization. The members throughout the country should lose no time in endeavoring to enlist the support of their representatives in the Legislature on behalf of the amendment. The object sought can be most efficiently promoted by this method, and at least cost. The formation of Chapters in various parts of the province, as suggested by <person>Mr. Gregg</person>, would, if practicable, prove most beneficial, but the experience of those who have tried the experiment, throws doubt on the probabilities of success. It might be worth considering whether interest in the Association would not be promoted by sometimes holding the meetings elsewhere than in Toronto—as for example, in Ottawa, Hamilton or London. The printed result of the tests of Canadian building stones made last year at the School of Practical Science, Toronto, under the direction of the Association, as presented by Mr. <person>Townsend</person>, chairman of the committee entrusted with the oversight of the work. They form a valuable feature of the proceedings, and must prove of great assistance to architects and builders. It is to be hoped that additional specimens of native stones may be tested, and also that similar tests may be applied to the varieties of native woods and other materials which enter into architectural and engineering work, in order that exactness of knowledge might characterize their, use. A retrospective view of what the Association has already accomplished, despite the disadvantages under which it has had to labor, and consideration of

the many directions in which it might do valuable service on behalf of the profession and the public in the future, should assure to it at this critical period in its history the wisest counsel and earnest support of every architect in the Province.

The President, <person>William. J. Hill </person>took the chair at 3 o'clock. The Treasurer's report showed the finances to be in a very satisfactory condition. The report of the Secretary showed a membership of 146, divided as follows: Brick Manufacturers' Section, 25 members; Masons' and Builders' Section, 68 members; Cut Stone Section, 14 members. The remaining members comprise carpenters, plasterers, plumbers, stone merchants and dealers in lumber, sewer pipes and cement, etc., who have not yet organization sections. The Board of Directors had held 36 meetings during the year, and the Finance Committee met nine times. Attention was called to the fact that the by-laws had been amended so that, when necessary, disputes between members and the expense of litigation might be avoided.

The election of officers was then proceeded with. The name of Win. J. Hill was proposed for re-election as President, but Mr. Hill stated that his duties in the City Council would prevent him giving the time necessary for the performance of the duties of the position.

The following officers were duly elected: Win. Pears, President; Geo. Moir, 1st Vice-President; Geo. Oakley, 2nd Vice-President; David Williams, Treasurer; Win. J. Hill, James Crang, Win. Park, Jno. Aldridge, Win. Booth, Directors.

The Board of Directors will further be increased by one representative from each Section of the Exchange. Win. J. Hill then vacated the chair, and Mr. Win. Pears upon taking his seat as President, thanked the Exchange for the honor conferred on him, and asked for the assistance of all the members in carrying forward the work of the Exchange.

A very hearty vote of thanks was tendered Mr. Hill, the retiring President, for the very able manner in which he had per formed his duties. Mr. Hill responded in suitable terms, and the meeting then adjourned.
