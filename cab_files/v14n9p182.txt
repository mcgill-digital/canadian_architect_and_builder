<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER

BUILDING MATERIALS AND CLAY PRODUCTS The report of the Ontario Bureau of Mines for 1901,

gives the aggregate value of the building materials produced during the year 1900, including tinder this term stone, lime, common brick, pressed brick and terra cotta, as $2,689,351, compared with $2,621,282 in 1899, an increase of $67,069. An error crept into the statistics of building stone and rubble for 1899 by which the value of the product WAS given as $1,041,350 instead of $667,532. The comparative table for the last two years is as follows













Judging from these figures says the report the building trade remained in a fairly active condition. Part of the increase is due to a rise in prices, the average cost of lime per bushel in 1900 being 13.9 cents as against 12.3 cents 1899, and common brick being valued at 5.73 per thousand as against $5.61 in 1899. The output of other clay products for the two years compares as follows drain tile, paving brick and sewer pipe showing a falling off which is more than made up by an increase n pottery.













The manufacture of cement continues to expand, the total production of 1900 being much larger than in any previous year. The increase is wholly in Portland cement, the natural rock variety being smaller in output and value than in 1899. The raw materials for an excellent quality of Portland cement marl and clayâ€” being so abundant in Ontario and the demand for pavement and construction purposes being so great and constant, there is every likelihood that the production will continue to increase, The number of cement works reporting to the Bureau last year was nine, of which tour made natural or rock cement and five Portland cement. In addition to the factories now in operation, one or two others will place their product on the market during 1901. The detailed statistics for 1900 are as follows

















There was an increase in the total quantity of cement produced in 1900 as compared with 1899 of 70,117 barrels and in value of product of $136,749. The average price at which the cement was reported to the Bureau was 79 cents per barrel for natural rock arid $1.95 for Portland, as against 84 cents and $2.00 per barrel respectively in 1899. That the home market is not by any means wholly supplied by the product of Ontario works is proven by the fact that during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1900, the imports of cement into Canada amounted to 1,312 , 170 cwt. as follows

The duty paid on the importations was $151,075.06. It is worthy of note that a marked change took place

during the year in the proportion of cement imported from the several countries of origin, In the 12 months ending 30 June, 1899, the imports were:













It will be seen that the imports of Belgian and German cement which had risen from $79,370 and $15,603 respectively in 1896 received a decided check, while those from Great Britain were almost doubled, and constituted even a larger proportion than in 1896 when they were $123,436 worth out of a total importation of $252,882. The preferential tariff, whatever may he its operation with respect to other articles, certainly seems to he effective with cement.

While the above statistics show that the importations of German and Belgian cements into Canada have largely decreased, and in like proportion those from Great Britain have increased. British statistics show that the product of continental factories, principally Belgian, is going into the British market at the rate of 270,000 tons per year, which is equal to ten per cent. of the production of the British factories. So that the gain that Great Britain is making in the Canadian market is being offset by the loss of home trade. The statement is made that the Belgian cement which is finding its way into the British market is not being sold at a loss, but owing to the excellent equipment and labor saving methods employed in factories where it is produced, it is bringing to the manufacturers a fair margin of profit. British manufacturers are in consequence being urged to modernize their works, thereby reducing the cost of production, and placing themselves in position to compete with the foreign material. Within the last five years the manufacture of Portland cement in the United States has been greatly extended and perfected, and the product of the mills across the border is this year being placed on the Canadian market in large quantities. Several new Canadian factories are ready to begin operations and others are projected, so that in the near future the capacity of the home mills will more nearly approach the requirements of this market. There is need for caution on the part of those who are thinking of engaging in the business to see that the manufacturing capacity does not run in advance of demand. This has already happened in the United States hence tile eyes of manufacturers there are being turned to Canada and other foreign markets.





With a view of securing better sanitary regulations in municipalities where waterworks and sewerage systems exist, a resolution was passed by Dominion Trades and Labor Congress that the Executive of the Congress urge the Legislative Assemblies of the Provinces to amend the health act so as to complete  such municipalities to appoint a competent plumbing inspector.
