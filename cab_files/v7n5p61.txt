IN Connection with the illustration of the Art Institute at Sackville, N. B., which appeared in our April number, the Cost of the building was given as $54,000 instead of $24,000.





THE Executive Committee of the American Institute of Architects has unanimously approved of the course of their President, Mr. D. H. Burnham, in conducting his recent correspondence with the U. S. Treasury department, to which we referred in our last issue.



WE: congratulate the Toronto Public School Board and the citizens generally on the action of the City Council in passing an appropriation of fifty thousand dollars for new school buildings to be erected this year. The Council could very properly have granted the total amount seventy-six thousand dollars —asked for by the Board for building purposes, but considering the financial policy of this year, they did well by the Public School Board.



A DEPUTATION representing the labor societies waited on the Minister of Public Works at Ottawa recently and requested among numerous other things that the contract system in the construction of public works should be abolished. The report of the Commission in the Curran Bridge investigation and the experience of Toronto and other cities which have attempted to substitute day labor for contract work, should be a sufficient answer to the deputation in question.



THE Dominion Government in their latest revision of the tariff have reduced the duty on wire nails from I 1/2, to cent per pound. Rolled iron or steel angles, channels, structural shapes and special sections, weighing less than 35 pounds per lineal yard, not otherwise specified, are to be charged 35 per cent. ad valorem, but not less than $10 per ton. On iron bridges and structural iron work the duty is made 30 per cent. ad valorem, but not less than one cent per pound.



IN our next issue we shall lay before our readers one of a series of articles prepared for the purpose of presenting some special subjects in a manner to make them of interest from the contractor's point of view. We expected to be able to publish the first of these in this number but found our space would not permit.

-These articles will be illustrated, and will deal with such subjects as the handling of large contracts, shoring for reconstruction of heavy buildings, modern appliances pertaining to contractors'

plant, etc.	_________ ______





IT is to be regretted that no arrangement has yet been arrived at between the Ontario Government and the City of Toronto for the improvement of the avenue from Queen Street to the new Parliament buildings. From the city's standpoint there is no place where an equal expenditure would add more to its attractiveness. For the interests of the province it may be said that the opportunity for beautiful parliament buildings has been lost, but the situation of the buildings is one of great natural advantage, and careful treatment of the surroundings and approaches would add to their attractiveness. This work should not be delayed. The authorities should also consider in this connection the advisability of Continuing the avenue directly south from Queen street through to Front street opposite the new Union Station. There are none but very cheap buildings in the way of such an extension and the new street frontages would be worth the whole cost. This would make the entrance to Toronto by way of the Union Station one such as few cities could boast.
