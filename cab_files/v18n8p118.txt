stairs occupy a narrow strip of space in the middle of the house is interesting. The scullery is 6' 6" x 5' 6". The height of this floor from floor to ceiling is 7' 6. The bedrooms are 14' 6" x 8' 3", 12' 9" X 7 3, and 9 9" X 7 10 ; and the ceiling height. (maximum) is

10' o . The walls are of 9-in. brick the roof is tiled. The ground floor is concreted, with wooden sleepers and floor over it. The windows are mostly double hung, and, as the illustration shows, have not. the wretched expedient for cheapness of opening only at the bottom.





Our second illustration is of a cottage, not a portion of the Garden City exhibition hut also apparently actually built for less than 300---or $1,500- the pair. The illustration was supplied to the Country Gentleman's Estate book by Mr. J. M. Hotchkiss who gives a full list of the items of cost saying they are '' what I have paid and am paying.'' The figures are worth giving, not so much from their value as a guide to prices here as that the list of items is equivalent to a specification and shows the quality of the work.

BOOK REVIEW.

THE SANITATION OF A COUNTRY HOUSE BY DR. HARVEY B. BASHORE. PUBLISHED BY JOHN WILEY & SONS, NEW YORK. PRICE $1.00. The aim of this work, as stated in the preface, is to make the country as healthy as the city. It is true that summer resorts sometimes bring sickness instead of health ; that there are rural localities which have more typhoid Fever per population than our great cities ; and Dr. Bashore declares that it is from the country that the cities get twenty five per cent. of their typhoid cases. His contribution to the prevention of this state of affairs is addressed to both



persons who build in the country, for permanent residence, and to summer visitors and campers. To the latter he gives warning chiefly about water supply and disposal of wastes. ''The price of pure water, where-ever you go, is everlasting and unremitting vigilance,'' and his advice for open water supply by streams, is ''to see the other end to its ' uttermost parts'." For the use of springs and wells the same consideration must be applied to the geographical strata through which he water comes, but he gives no to

	rules	make

this easy. If it is necessary to take water from a suspicious stream, he recommends the plan practiced by the natives of India, who dig little holes in the sand of the shore until they get below the water level, and so, when the holes fill with water ,get water which has filtered through the sand and is safer than the raw water of the stream.

The matter of waste disposal at summer camps is a matter which is within command, and Dr. Bashore's directions are good and easily followed.

For permanent building in the country there are matters to be considered of which we have little cause to think in town and, it is to be feared, think little in the country. "Ground-water," "ground-moisture," and ''ground-air," are all to be considered in building the cellar. If ground-moisture is had in absorptive soils permeable soils, which offer less of this danger, must make good going for ground—air which is no less unwholesome. This which is the product of decomposition and putrefaction processes, continually going on in the soil, has an undue proportion of carbonic acid gas, ammonia, hydrogen ammonium sulphide
