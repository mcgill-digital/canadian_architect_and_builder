HOW TO DECORATE. <article title=" HOW TO DECORATE " author="Elliot, W. H.">

-	BY W. H. ELLIOTT

T is a mistake to suppose that because a wall paper J .or a piece of stained glass, or an artic!e of furniture,

or a hanging is cheap, it-should- also of neccesity br in bad taste. Doubtless the fact that much that is cheap is bad as well, has given ground f6r the supposition that a good thing cannot be had—without paying well for it. Therefore in, the first place do not be satisfied with anything that has the negative quality of stylelessness, and that cannot be objected to because there is nothing to.

·	object to in it. Aim at an effect of some kind in every room down to the kitchen Study the purposes for which

room is used, in the carpets, wall papers and hangings, as well as in the furniture. There, is a style of design which is as appropriate for the bedroom as the bedstead is. A quiet paper in light color for the main wall, with a deep frieze or upper paper in flower designs naturally treated, generally make a good effect for a bedroom wall, with hangings ot somewhat similar design to the_upper paper. There being usually few unimportant pictures on bedroom walls, bright sparkling color in parts af the decoration is very desirable, to give interest

—	to the treatment of the room. Do not be afraid of color, unless it is in bad taste. Neutral tints and absence- ot— color are -in evidence of weak taste or of a timidity 'begotten of ignorance.__Adinmg room'_should be warm

and rich in color, especially in the ceiling, the walls being

a suitable background for the best	house. And so on through every room in the house let there be evidence of study and discrimination in the selection and arrangement of every detail. Above all, do not endeavor to transplant a friend's room which you very much ad-'mire into' a very different- location in your own house

which may make the decoration in every way unsuitable

-A room into which no ray of sunlight can possibly find its way, may well' be in china yellow or terra cotta and 'all the sunny colors of silk and cretonne, but such effectsin a southerly chamber with large openings for the glowing sunlight, would almost dispense with the necessity of further warmth in the coldest weather, to say nothing of the smothering sensation one would feel during July or August on entering the room.

Again, do not buy a carpet or. a drapery you particularly fancy, and then endeavor to have all the other features of the room conform to it. This is a favorite method of going to 'work on the decoation of a room,

- and it is a safe thing to calculate_on _very much vexation of spirit and very moderate success as results-of the method.

If you have confidence in your decorator, submit your judgment to his in all matters of experience, and in most matters of taste, reserving for yourself the perhaps as important items of expense and personal preference or antipathy. 



To make gold lacquer, put- into a four-gallon tin one pound of ground turmeric, one and a halfounces of gainboge, three and a half of - powdered gum sandarach, three-quarters- of- a pound of shellac,- and two gallons of spirits of wine. .When shaken, dissolved and strained, add one pint of turpentine varnish well mixed.

Bright colors and positive tints may be employed in outside decorations with excellent in emphasizing architectural features, 'but the more brilliant they are, the greater is the demand for 'good judgment' in their application. 

With the rich and varied decoration in vogue house-painters are beginnig, to regard their craft as closely trenching on the fine arts. in relief work, however, they still wisely depend on the effects of light on flat and curved forms for the shade. 

—A new form of table lamp is in brass of ovaline form, having on two sides a concave porcelain medallion on which is paint a female. form. A jet black shade pierced for medallions consists ' of portraits painted on porcelain, surrounded with inlaid leaves- and twigs in silvery metal on the dark shad

Were concave ceilings introduced into parlor, dinin and' reception rooms, better opportunities for the decoration would be afforded A concave sky, although the curve is alIbut impreceptible is certainly more pleasing than a flat sky. With such a ceiling the cove could be dispensed with; and with angular molded lines, forming border of ceiling, would disappear, giving place to flower, leaf and branch designs -reaching upward and outward. To a lofty room such a ceiling would impart increased stateliness. Where the ceiling is structually flat, converging ribbed arches with central pendent or base might be carried out in paper mache. Rooms present so niany angles, mantels and furniture contribut inga considerable share in addition to walls that curvilinear forms are welcome variations. Even deep cof- fers, polychsomatically decorated are enhanced in beauty  carries the eye naturally from 'one side to the other of the, ceiling surface, thus causing it to take in the-whole.
