<article title=" Cement Blocks " author="">Cement Blocks.

The new <building>Dairy Building for the Toronto Industrial Exhibition </building>is well worth examination by architects as an exhibit

of cement block walking. It gives the Dairy Building a good architectoric appearance, and suggest the attainment of a characteristic effect at any rate plain work. It is rather questionable whether the right result is being attained by casting the blocks in imitation of rock faced stone; but it is remarkable how little the similarity of the blocks, which are of course all cast with the same face, catches the eye. Experience, however , teaches that this treatment will weary in time, if it does not at first. It ought to he possible to give a surface to the blocks, if that is needed, without trying to make them look like stone. If one may judge from the smooth portions of the work—the pilasters, etc. at the entrances -the edges of the blocks are what need most treatment, and attention would be well devoted to the joint.





WHILE the newspapers are continually urging the advantages of municipal management of public utilities and depicting private contractors in the light of robbers of the privileges and hard-earned dollars, of the citizens, the cold facts do not bear out their assertions. On the

contrary, it is the case, in Toronto, at least, that every public undertaking placed directly under the control of the Council in recent years has been badly bungled and has resulted in loss of the public funds. The latest example is to be found in the new Exhibition Buildings The contract for the structural steel work for the Main Building was awarded last February to the Canada Foundry Company, whose tender was the lowest. The Council was subsequently prevailed on to call for new tenders, which resulted in considerable loss of time. The Canada Foundry Company's tender again proved to be the lowest and was accepted. A further delay ensued while the Council listened to deputations from the Unions who wanted changes mad in the specifications on which the tenders were based. This the contractors rightly refused to permit. Then changes were made



in the drawings, necessitating the re-cutting of some of the structural material. As a result of these causes, two months of valuable lime were frittered away, and the contractors were compelled to notify the Council that because of the delay, for which they were in no way responsible, the building could not be completed within the specified time and would not be available for this year's Exhibition. <building>The St. Lawrence Market Building</building> is another such example of municipal bungling. The citizens have to a large extent lost confi
