water and also the surplus water, I find that the scum is composed of:

	Silica		19.45

	Alumina and Iron	Oxide 	6.50

	Lime		47.94

	Anhydrous	Acid	4.48

	Magnesia		2. o8

	Carbon Dioxide		16. 73

	97. 19



The low percentage of lime, with the high percentage of carbon dioxide indicates, to my mind, that the fine underhurned particles of cement rise during the manipulation and with, of course, a large proportion of cement form a scum. In this scum is a considerable quantity of sulphuric acid. This scum weighs only a small fraction of one per cent. of the total cement used.

The analysis of the surplus water disclosed the fact that the objectionable sodium carbonate was in solution. In fact from 800 grains of cement 3.563 grains of sodium carbonate was obtained or nearly 0.5

An analysis of the cement in the first place showed alkalies (or sodium oxide and potassium oxide) 0.82 Now assuming that 3/5 of this 0.8215006r about of the cement, is sodium oxide, we can have 0.8ˆ\žùžùodium carbonate, in other words there is only enough sodium in the cement to make 0.8 úodium carbonate' We have removed nearly by our treatment and as some of the sodium must be intimately combined with the cement, there cannot, in my opinion, he enough left to cause an appearance of the white surface deposit.

A test made of the cement, after the treatment, shows that the strength in a few days is considerably increased. The following is the result of the test

Tensile Strength . . . 3 (sand) to (cement)

	24 hours	41 pds. per sq. in.

	4 days 	162

	7 days	215



Referring to the test of the cement before treatment, you will see that the tensile strength 3 to was

for 24 hours	63 pounds per sq. In.



for 7 days	178



or after treatment, to remove sodium carbonate, the strength of the 3 to 1 mortar was in 24 hours 352wer than when not treated, due entirely to the fact that a large percentage of water was of necessity used in mixing, and when such is the case, the hardening is more gradual than when mixed drier, In 7 days, however, it was, as shown by the above, 21 3459gher than in the ordinary test.

These tests will he carried on up to three months so as to be sure that the increase is not only temporary.

The above analysis and figures give convincing proof; in my opinion, that your treatment not only gets rid of the objectionable sodium carbonate, the cause of the white surface deposit, but also increases the strength of the stone.

H.---COARSE AND FINE SCREENING.



Mr. Jarvis has given us also a report, made to him by Mr. Johnston, of a test to establish the relative values of aggregate with and without dust. The result of the tests is to establish in every case greater strength for the mortar which included the dust.

SKY SCRAPER CHURCHES.

The Broadway Tabernacle of New York, an historic Congregational church, originally situated down town, moved in 1859 to a site on the corner of Sixth Avenue and 34th Street, which cost them $62,500. This property was sold in 1902 for $1,300,000. The church has therefore money, not exactly to burn but for building fireproof. It has built an eight storey building which contains many other things besides a hall for preaching in. The accommodation begins, in the basement, with the social hall and accompanying kitchen and pantry service. It is not only evening gatherings that this department is expected to serve but, in order to facilitate the various kinds of work that go on in the daytime, luncheons must be provided for the workers.

The ground floor, (which in design appears to serve the function of a basement to the auditorium or principal floor above,) contains a hall called Pilgrim 11 all, to seat 600 people. This hall is to have a stage, with footlights, certain, dressing rooms and all regular requirements of the theatre, including private boxes. The purpose of the hall is not for a dramatic department of the church, but to lend a hand to causes that should be heard, by supplying at a nominal charge a place for their hearing. On this floor also appears to be the prayer meeting room.

The principal floor contains the auditorium, which is much like other auditoriums, and has a small chapel adjacent, for weddings and small gatherings.

Above the auditorium floor or properly speaking floors, for there are galleries is a Sunday School consisting of a two-storey hall with two storeys of class rooms, with movable fronts, opening upon it.

Above this again are a floor of women's parlours next a floor of men's parlours ; next the administration floor, with the pastors study, office and waiting room, and rooms for his various assistants and, at the top is the sexton's dwelling. It is proposed to add, some day, two floors for a museum.

The Baptists of Cleveland, or at any rate the Rev. Charles Eaton of that denomination, have a project for a building still higher, (reaching 12 storeys,) and more comprehensive, (as it will include sleeping accommodation.) There will be an auditorium in the same position as that in the Broadway Tabernacle, occupying the first and second floors, (or, as Dr. Eaton would call, it the second and third) and approached by a grand staircase ; but the rest of the building will be a
