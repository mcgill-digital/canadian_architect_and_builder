<doctype type="text">THE CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	March, 1889



into letting contracts to men of no mechanical standing. It is hoped and expected that through the influence of the <assoc>National Association of Builders</assoc>, and the intercourse its executive officers may have with the reputable architects of the country, that the day is not far distant when it will be required of the artisan in the various branches pertaining to buildings, to arm himself with a proper and authoritative testimonial, giving proof that he is skilled in his art, and thus divest the wheat from the chaff, and the former be recognized and the latter find its level.

It is a well-known fact that plaster on a ceiling surface, in the event of fire, will detain it for a long time, providing any means have been taken when applied to secure it under such circumstances, and were these means more generally employed, millions of dollars would be saved to this country annually.

As the fire-proof construction is the exception, and as wood construction must predominate for years to come, therefore, more attention should be given to make the latter structure more fire-resisting.

During the last twenty years I have devoted much thought to this subject, and some of the devices I have had in that direction, I have sought to secure by letters patent, and, strange to say, came in conflict with an English patent in the archives at Washington, bearing date 1797. The device then discovered has been slumbering there nearly one hundred years, and to-day, I know of nothing more economical or effectual to secure plaster in position in the event of fire than this same device. It is simply a wire netting, as used to-day for a foundation, but as these described placed over the bottom surface of the plaster, and then securely stapled to the furring or joints, and afterward the finishing coat of plaster applied over the surface. And as most every mechanic has at some time or other taken out a patent, or applied for one, it may be interesting to you to hear the language that <person>Edmund Cartwright </person>(as that was the name of the applicant) used in paying due deference to his sovereign lord.

After describing his invention in substantially the same language that obtains in patents of the present day, he closes thus:

"In witness whereof, I, the said Edmund Cartwright, have hereunto set my hand and seal this eighth day of November, in the thirty-eighth year of the reign of our Sovereign Lord, <person>George the Third</person>, by the grace of God, of Great Britain, France and Ireland King, Defender of the Faith, and so forth, and in the year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and ninety-seven.

EDMUND CARTWRIGHT."





Some of the designs in art tiles are formed by pressing on the surface actual stalks, leaves and flowers, reliefs being taken from the impressions, either the intaglio or embossed design supplying a pattern for dies. Intaglio tiles, may have the incised lines filled with enameled colors corresponding in hue, if desired, to the objects impressed.



It is suggested that a profitable opening exists for the manufacture of plaster of Paris from plaster of gypsum, which is produced and exported in large quantities from Nova Scotia.

Messrs <firm>George Moore & Co</firm>., of Waterloo, Ont., have bought the well-known brick-yards of Mr. <person>Oetzel</person> at Berlin and Waterloo, and fitted them up with the latest and most approved machinery.

The Winnipeg Sun says that Mr. <person>J. R. Tracey </person>of that city, who is the inventor of a heating apparatus as an attachment to cook stoves, will come east shortly and endeavor to commence the manufacture of his invention at some point in Ontario.

At the annual meeting of the <firm>Owen Sound Stone Quarrying and Construction Co</firm>., held recently, the following officers were elected; President, <person>S. G. Parker</person>; Vice-President. <person>George Inglis</person>; Secretary-Treasurer, <person>W. R. Stephens</person>; Manager, <person>David Chalmers</person>.

A deputation of soil pipe makers from Montreal, Toronto and Hamilton, interviewed the Ministers of Finance and Customs recently, and asked for an increase of duties on pipes of less than 4 inches diameter. They want a specific instead of an ad valorem duty.

Electricity is being more and more used for the purification of kaolin and other porcelain clays. The clay is sifted on to a rapidly revolving horizontal plate, which is surrounded with powerful electro-magnets, which retain the particles of iron. From this the clay passes to a second plate which removes the last traces. The process is said to be comparatively cheap and very rapid, and since its introduction, many clays hitherto rejected as containing too much iron have become of value for the manufacture of pottery.
