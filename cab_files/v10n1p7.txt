<doctype type="text">	The CANADIAN	ARCHITECT AND BUILDER	7



contract, which, in the aggregate amounted to the sum of $436,199.72. in February, 1867, authority was granted to make Certain alterations

in the legislative assembly chamber, for the accommodation of the increased number of members forming the House of Commons under the confederation of the provinces. These works are now completed.

The departmental buildings having been finished, and the works on the parliament buildings well advanced, the staff was considerably reduced in the spring of 1867, and in the month of May, the services of Mr. <person>Thomas Fuller</person>, architect, were dispensed with.

The site chosen for the buildings is in the centre of the city of Ottawa, about a mile below the Chaudiere Falls, on a prominent rocky point jutting out into the Ottawa River, at an elevation considerably higher than the city and lands in the vicinity. On the eastern side it is flanked by a deep ravine, in which are situated the combined locks of the Ridean Canal. The north side is bold and precipitions, and on the western side the ground slopes quickly toward the south-west and diminishes in width. On the southern or lowest side, it is, for a distance of 1,750 feet, bounded by Wellington street, which is one of the principal streets of the city, and descends in a westerly direction towards the falls.



The point is of an irregular shape, t,o5o feet wide at the centre, and contains an area of fully 29 acres. It was formerly known as Barrack Hill, and is a part of the ordnance lands conceded to the province.

The buildings are placed so as to form three sides of a quadrangle, measuring from north to south 6oo feet, from east to west 700 feet, and containing an area of over 9 1/2 acres.

The parliament building is on the north side of the square, upon which it has a frontage of 472 feet. It faces toward the south, and its extreme depth at the centre is 370 feet, covering an area of about 82,886 superficial feet, or about t 9-to acres.

The departmental buildings for the east and west sides of the square: they are of a rectangular shape, having 1)0th quadrangle and southern fronts, the line of the latter being 100 feet north of Wellington street.

The eastern block has a frontage on the square of 319 feet, and 245 feet on the south. It covers an area of 41,840 superficial feet, or fully nineteen-twentieths of an acre.

The western block has a frontage towards the south of 277 feet, and on the quadrangle of 220 feet, with an area of 32,276 feet superficial, equal to about seventeen-twentieths of an acre. Thus the total area covered by all the buildings is about 7-to acres.

The parliament building is on the highest part of the ground, and its basement floors are about 159 feet above the ordinary summer water level of the Ottawa River. Those of the eastern and western blocks are respectively 135 feet 3 inches and 142 feet 3 inches over the same datum.

A continuous carriage road has been made all round the square, and extended northward at both ends of the parliament building towards the Speaker's towers, and also along the southern fronts of the departmental buildings.

The entrances to the grounds are opposite Elgin and Metcalf streets. From these points the roads incline gently to within a short distance of the parliament building, where they ascend by a steeper grade to the level of a wide terrace, which has been formed along the southern front of that structure.



The square has been graded to a gradual rise from the road which runs parallel with Wellington street up to the foot of the terrace, and to a plane corresponding to the levels of the eastern and western blocks.

All the buildings are constructed in what may be termed the pointed gothic style of architecture, and from the bold, broken outline they presentâ€”their numerous towers, high pitched, variegated slate roofs, pierced by dormers and surmounted by ornamental wrought iron cresting and terminals, together with the quaintness (if the carved figures, combine to produce an imposing and picturesque effect.

The outer facing of the walls is principally composed of a light colored, compact sandstone, obtained front the Township of Nepean, at a distance of about 12 miles from the city. The dressings, stairs, gablets, pinnacles, &c., are chiefly of a grayish colored freestone, from the State of Ohio, and the relieving arches over the door and window openings are of a reddish sandstone, from Potsdain, in the northern part of New York State, The slates are generally of a dark color, with bands of a lighter hue placed at intervals. They are obtained in the State of Vermont.

The foundations and interior portions of the walls are of limestone, quarried in the vicinity. The division walls and lining of the external walls are chiefly of brick, manufactured either at Ottawa or at other places in the province.

The marble used in the buildings was principally obtained from Arnprior and other places on the Ottawa River.

The valley of the Ottawa also supplied the timber used in the construction, with the exception of the oak, which had to be brought front other parts of the province.

The total of the amounts expended on the buildings from 1st May, 1859, to 1st July, t866, was $2,723,981.58, less $157,788.34 for furniture and fuel. These figures are, of course, exclusive (if the cost of the Langevin Block.

The mode of beating adopted throughout the buildings is by steam produced in boilers, situated near the centres of the respective blocks, and applied generally on what is termed the "Vault System."

This may be briefly described as consisting of a series of ducts for the admission of external air, over which are constructed, in. the interior of the buildings, vaults for steam pipes leading front the boilers. The air enters these vaults through the perforated coverings of the ducts, is heated by coils of pipes, and subsequently passes through openings in the top of the vaults, into the various rooms, etc. On this system the two legislative chambers and the central portion of the parliament buildings are heated, with the exception of the main vestibule, and the rooms immediately over it. These, together with both the wings, are heated by direct radiation from steam coils, placed in the corridors and varieties apartments. The other two blocks of buildings are also heated on the Vault System, except a few rooms, where it was considered expedient to place coils for the purpose of heating by direct radiation, lit this manner the attics are also warmed.

Two modes have been adopted for the ventilation of the chambers, one termed the "upward system and the other the " downward system"

Time latter provides for drawing off the vitiated air near the floor, through perforated gratings, in the risers of the platforms, on which time members seats are placed. These gratings open into spaces between the arches tinder the floors of the houses, which are connected at several places with foul air ducts running around the chambers in the basement

passages. These ducts are all joined at the north-east and north-west angles of the respective houses, and from thence extended, so as to enter the main extracting shaft, at a level of 7 feet over the boiler house floor

The air in the shaft being rarefied by the heat of the iron smoke pipes, an upward draught is created, by which the foul air is rapidly extracted through foe ducts front the chambers, arid escapes through the side openings formed near the 101).

The "upward system" may be described as consisting chiefly of a series of small ventiduers arrange d along the ceiling, and leading to others at the sides, of larger capacity, with openings into the ventilating shafts, situated at the north end of the chambers.

The two systems above mentioned are in effective operation in L 10th chambers, In the House of Commons, there is, however, additional  of upward ventilation provided, by the insertion of cast iron perforated gratings in eight of the centre panels of the ceilings over the galleries. These communicate with large ventiducts leading to the shafts, and constructed tinder the roof on each side of the chamber.

The main drains from all the buildings discharge into the Ottawa River at three points, at the northern base of the hill. They are stink so as to drain the respective boiler houses, which, as previously stated, are to feet below the level of the basement floors. This unavoidably entailed deep cuttings in rock of irregular strata and difficult of excavation. The upper portions of the trenches were, however. used as a channel for the cold air (bets.

As the best means of supplying time buildings with water, appeared to be by pumping from the river in their immediate vicinity, it was decided, after a careful examination of the locality, that the most advan. tageous site for the necessary work would be on time river edge in the rear of the library, where the point stands furthest out into the current, and the purest water would most likely be obtained. The cliff being at almost all parts steep to the waters' edge, excel)t at one place, where there was a small surface of flat rock, at a level of about 9 feet above low water, this was selected as the best position for the engine house. The pumps are driven by steam power.

From the engine house the rising main 6 inches diameter, is carried obliquely up the face of the hill, in a trench averaging over feet in depth, to the top, where it curves and runs nearly straight to the west end of the parliament buildings. It is then carried into a room in the basement of the north-west angle tower, where there is an arrangement of valves, curved pities, etc., by which the supply to the several blocks is regulated.

The tanks are situated in the six angle towers, as high as the roofs will permit. They are t6 feet diameter at top, 15 1/2 feet at bottom, and 9 1/2 feet high, except the main receiving tank, which is 10 1/2 feet. As each tank is capable of holding about 12,500 gallons, their aggregate capacity is over 75,000 gallons.
