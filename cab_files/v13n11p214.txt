METHOD OF HOISTING A SET OF LARGE BELLS.

TORONTO, Nov. 18th, 1900.

Editor CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.



SIR,--â€”In answer to your request for information and a description of how the bells are to be hoisted into place in the tower of the New City Buildings, Toronto, I send you the following memos and accompanying section and plan to better illustrate my description.

There are to be three bells; the largest weighs 12,000 pounds and the other two 3,000 and 2,000 pounds respectively.

The bells have to be hoisted upon the outside of the tower to the height of about 225 feet, and taken in through the open space for the clock dials, and lowered down about 50 feet in the inside of the tower to their hanging

if, indeed, it ever has occurred before that a bell of the weight of the large bell, viz., 12,000 pounds, had to be hoisted up on the outside of a building to the height that this bell has to be hoisted, before it could be delivered down into its resting place. All this trouble and expense is incurred for the reason that the contract for the clock and bells was not let in time so that other provisions might have been made for the placing of these bells. I do not, however, fear for the success of the undertaking.

position, which will be about 6 feet above the sills of the large open belfry windows.

In arranging for an undertaking such as the hoisting of these bells, (especially the large one), quite a problem had to be faced, for it must be borne in mind that it is a very unusual undertaking,

four large Gargoyles, each of which weighs 14,000 pounds, and when placed project out 9 ft. 6 in. beyond the face of the angle buttresses of the tower, and tail in on the wall about 6 feet, making the total length about 15 feet. But in the hoisting of the gargoyles I used the derrick and tackling that I had especially
