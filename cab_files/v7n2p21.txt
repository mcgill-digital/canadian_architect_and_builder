TO ADVERTISERS.



For the benefit of advertisers, a copy of this Journal is mailed each week to persons mentioned in the CON.TRACT RECORD'S reports as intending to build, with a request to consult our advertisement pages and write advertisers for material, machinery, etc.





As we go to press the annual convention of the National Association of Builders of the United States is being held at Boston, Mass. The convention will continue for three days. An important feature of the programme is an address by the Hon. Carroll I). Wright, Commissioner for the Department of Labor for the United States, on "The Relations of the Employer and Workman." A discussion will follow the address, with the view of taking action toward the improvement of the Association's form of permanent arbitration.



THIS number of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is largely devoted to a report of the proceedings of the annual convention of the Ontario Association of Architects. Notwithstanding that the number of our pages has been increased it has been found necessary to hold over the publication of several interesting papers read at the Convention. In point of interest the meeting was unquestionably one of the best in the history of the Association. The proposal to form a collection of photo. graphs at the School of Science of the work of Canadian architects, and Submit the work represented by the photographs to the criticism of the members of the Association, should serve to awaken interest in the Association and increase the attendance at future conventions.



WE wish to call the attention of our readers, especially the students, to the new "Students' Department," which will be found henceforth in every issue of this journal. It is our intention to devote this space to the use and advantage of students, although the ' Intercommunication Column" will be open to all readers. This column with the questions and answers given this month, speaks for itself, and we invite the co-operation of all able to supply the required information, to make Ibis a valuable department. Questions will be published in the next issue after they are received, and all answers received in the following issue, but when a question is received requiring an immediate answer, we will endeavor to supply it in the first Issue. We Invite additional answers to those given this month. This department will contain a large amount of information which it will be well for students to keep on file. In this department this month will be found particulars of another competition for students. To Students in the employ of architects who are subscribers to the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER, the MONTHLY EDITION ION of this journal will be delivered postage free for ONE DOLLAR per year. The order for subscription must be accompanied by one dollar and the certificate of the architect in whose office the student is employed. This offer is made with the object of enabling every student to have in his own possession, and accessible when required, the information supplied through this and other departments, and that none may be debarred from entering our students' competitions.



AS will be seen in the report of the proceedings of the Ontario Association of Architects, The CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER comes in for some rather rough handling for an editorial note in the issue of November, 1893, which was read in the Convention and which will be found reprinted in the report of proceedings where read. The burden of the strictures upon the comment in question was that it was not proper criticism. Why it should be so classed is hard to say. There was nothing underhanded in the statement, nor was it unbacked by argument, although from the nature of the passage in which the question was treated—a brief editorial note it was necessary that the argument should be terse and suggestive rather than explanatory. The President of the Association was quite right in repudiating the note as an Association utterance, and might very properly have gone farther and ruled the introduction and discussion of the subject out of order at the outset, for the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER is not published by the
