MUIRH FAD'S

METAL WHITE

This article, as its name implies, is a White Metallic Paint, ground in Pure Linseed Oil.

IT DOES NOT injure the Linseed Oil as all grades of White Lead do.

IT WILL NOT chalk nor flake off.

IT WILL NOT blacken in an impure atmosphere.

IT HAS greater speeding capacity than White Lead.

IT IS non-poisonous, being a perfect sanitary paint, IT IS more easily applied than White Lead. IT IS unrivalled for pointing the inside and outside

of houses farm implements, boats, greenhouses, or any thing requiring paint.

BY ACTUAL I EST is has worn six times as long as pure White Lead on a floorâ€”it is equally good for door steps and decks oh vessels.

IT MAY be tinted to any shade.

IT IS the most important article introduced for painting in recent years.
