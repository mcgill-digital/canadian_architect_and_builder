Mr. <person>Peachy</person>, who died at Quebec, his native city, on the 31st December last, aged 73, was first a pupil of the late <person>P. Gauvreau</person>, local Government Architect for many years, and then studied for some time under, and was partner of Mr. <person>C. Baillarge</person>, Architect.

During his professional career he erected, after its destruction by fire in 1882, the Parish Church of St. <person>Jean Baptiste</person>, of which Mr. Bailiarge had fathered the first edition in 1854. Prof. <person>Haire</person>, of New York, considered that the interior of this edifice, due to its height and light and the elegance of its proportions, compared favourably with the New York churches.

Mr. Peachy was the architect of the RR. gentlemen of the Seminary of Quebec, whose chapel he re-built, after its destruction by fire, and also what is called "Le Grand Seminaire," uniting the old Seminary to the University Buildings, erected under Mr. Baillarge in

1854.

The subject of our notice also designed the new Cathedral and the Seminary buildings at Chicoutimi the interior of the church of N. D. de Ste Anne de Beaupre; the church of N. D. de Lourdes at St. Sauveur, together with numerous buildings, including chambers, presbyteries, school houses, private residences, as well in many of the parishes of the Province of Quebec as throughout the city itself.

Mr. Peachy was, for some 20 consecutive years, a representative of St. John's Ward, Quebec, in the City Council, becoming in time president of the road and then of the Water Works Committees.

He was one of the church wardens for the Parish of St. Jean Baptiste ; for some years the president of the school of Arts and Trades, which had its rooms in a very nice building, designed by him, on St. Joachim St. He was a past president of the <assoc>Province of Quebec Association of Architects</assoc>.

The late Mr. Peachy was, in every respect, a man of ability and unimpeachable character.
