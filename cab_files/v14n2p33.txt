POINTERS FOR ESTIMATORS.

<article title=" POINTERS FOR ESTIMATORS " author="">

WHEN making an estimate for amount of material required for laying a floor of given dimensions, it should be remembered that a thousand feet face measure of rough stuff, is reduced about 25 per cent. by planing and matching, and when bought at a factory, it is measured out as rough 1 umber, therefore, you pay for 1,000 feet and receive only 750 feet of actual covering. This is accounted for because of the fact that the mill owner—to make a reasonable profit—must sell out his lumber as he buys it in, and estimators usually make their estimates accordingly. It the flooring be narrow, 2 or 3 inches on the face, a larger percentage must be allowed. It is true, however, that at some mills flooring and other matched stuff is sold face measure, but is charged at a higher rate to cover loss. It is always better, however, to make estimates allowing 25 per cent. over actual measurements of flooring.

In laying a pine floor, one man working nine hours a day, will lay 625 feet, which, at $2.50 per day, will cost $4 per 1,000 feet. If we add to this 35 pounds of nails, which will be required for same, they, as well as cost of flooring must be added. In this case the figures cover 1,000 feet in actual face measure. If the floor is of hardwood and very narrow, 500 feet will be a fair days work for one man, and more nails will be required. There is generally more waste in hardwood flooring than in pine.
