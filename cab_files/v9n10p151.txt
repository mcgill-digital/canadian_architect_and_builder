AN agreement has been entered into Trade Combines, between the Granite Dealers' Association of Aberdeen, Scotland, and the

Boston Wholesale Granite Dealers' Association, whereby the former binds itself not to sell to anyone in the United States who is not a member of the Boston Association, while the latter Association binds itself not to purchase granite from any person outside the membership of the Aberdeen Association. Our recollection is that there are on record instances in which the courts have compelled combines of this character to sell to outsiders who were desirous of purchasing their goods.

From the National Association of Building Inspectors convened last month at Buffalo, comes the following resolution on the subject "That it is the opinion of the National Association of Building Inspectors that public safety demands that persons practising the profession and trade of architect, civil engineer and builder should do so under license, to the end that those who practice Such responsible professions and trades should first show their fitness to do so therefore, we recommend the passage of State laws leading to the accomplishment of this end." Building inspectors are daily brought in contact with the work of incompetent architects and builders, and have the opportunity of knowing, as few can, the danger of loss
