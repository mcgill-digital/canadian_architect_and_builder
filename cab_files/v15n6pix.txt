NOTES.

<person>Robert McCausland Limited</person>, the well known manufacturers of stained glass have recently removed to new premises specially designed for their use at No. 86 Wellington street, West, Toronto.



Frosting upon glass may easily be accomplished by mixing magnesium sulphate (Epsom salts) with beer. Apply by means of a sponge. Bind it upon the glass by running over it a wash made of gum arabic and water.



Putty may readily be softened by rubbing over it a strong solution of caustic soda, which should be applied by means of an old paint brush. Moistening the putty with spirits of salts will also rapidly turn it soft, when it may readily be removed.



Be sure you have figured accurately on a job, allowed yourself fair pay for honest work, counted the cost of all material used, and taken into consideration every expense incurred, before you name your price for the work.



Oak and cherry woodwork may have Indian yellow walls with a deep Indian yellow frieze, and Indian yellow cornice, the ceiling of light Indian yellow, with the upholsterings of the same tone, or cardinal red, olive or blue, and the draperies of heliotrope.



An excellent hard drying putty for exposed situations, as skylights and roofing work, may be prepared by mixing whiting with boiled linseed oil, adding about '6 of its weight of powdered

litharge. Mix only sufficient for immediate use as it rapidly hardens.
