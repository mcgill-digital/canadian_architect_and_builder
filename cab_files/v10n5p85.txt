THE City Council and citizens of Toronto Queen's Park Improvements. are to be congratulated upon the transformation which is being effected as



the result of recent expenditures for the improvement of Queen's Park. As the site of the Legislative and several university buildings, and surrounded by handsome residences, this park is visited by most travelers who come to the city.
