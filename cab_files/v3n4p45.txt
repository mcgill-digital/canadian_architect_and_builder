no current of air through the soil pipe at all. The inlet should be as low, and the outlet as high as possible in every case. If the inlet is to be carried up to the roof, and inside a house, there will at once be an up draft, except that as it is in connection with the soil pipe in which also an up draft would be created, but for the height of the so called "inlet;" but as they are connected there will simply be a stagnation of air in the pipes.

Yours truly,

ARCHITECT.

</assoc>I

 IN accordance with the suggestion of Mr. <person>S. G. Curry</person>, no special subject was announced for the meeting to be held Tuesday, March 25th, over which he was to preside. Many subjects were brought up for debate and some lively discussions were the result, among those taking part being Messrs. <person>Simpson</person>, <person>Dawson</person>, <person>Brown</person>, <person>Barrett</person>, <person>Rae </person>and <person>Wilby</person>.

The third club competition was decided at this meeting, a good showing of drawings for a baptismal font having been submitted. The following were the successful competitors in order of merit Senior Section, Messrs. <person>G. T. Goldstone</person>, <person>J. A. Radford</person>, <person>C. J. Gibson</person>; Junior Section, Messrs. <person>A. C. Barrett</person>, <person>T. B. Johnston </person>and <person>J. Y. S. Russell</person>.

A thoughtful and well rendered design was received from Mr. <person>J. McC. Radford</person>, a Montreal member of the club, but it was too late to be judged with the other members. Mr. <person>Frank Darling </person>gave a thorough criticism of each of the designs in an impartial and acceptable manner.

The first exhibition of the club was opened to the members at this meeting and to the public for the remaining days of the week. It was a loan exhibition by Mr. <person>Win. R Gregg </person>of photographs of representative buildings in the United States, and proved a very interesting one to the members and to the large numbers who visited it during the week.

On Tuesday, April 8th, the club forsook its headquarters to accept the invitation of Mr. <person>James Bain </person>to spend the evening at the Public Library in studying the many works on architecture it contains. Few were aware of the value of the collection, and the meeting will probably result in a more liberal patronage of the institution by the architects and draughtsmen who were present.



NOTES.



The Club is rapidly gaining in numbers. At the last meeting the following names were put through . Messrs. <person>J. P. Murray</person>, <person>M. B. Aylesworth</person>, <person>J. P. Hynes</person>, <person>W. A. Sherwood </person>and <person>John A. Pearson</person>.

Some forty members have taken advantage of the special artist's rate granted the club and secured season tickets to the <building>Toronto Art Gallery</building>.

It has been suggested that a Photographic Section be formed for the summer season, the object being the organization of photographic trips, and holding of exhibitions of amateur work,

 LARGELY attended meeting a few days since passed resolutions favorable to the erection of a monument to the memory of <person>Major Short </person>and <person>Sergt. Wallick </person>of B Battery, Canadian regiment of artillery, who were accidentally killed while looking at the great fire of the 16th May last. when a large portion of St. Sauveur was destroyed Collectors have been appointed to canvass for subscriptions, and a committee named to open negotiations with Canadian sculptors with a view of arriving at a decision as to a design and cost. It is anticipated that a sufficient sum will he available to guarantee the erection of a handsome memorial.

Plans for the new hotel proposed to be built on the site of the old Parliament buildings are now being prepared. When completed they will be submitted for final approval by the directors, when tenders for its construction will be invited, it will approximate $200,000 in cost. Work will probably begin about the end of May. Standing at an elevation of about 150 feet above the St. Lawrence, its position will command a view of the magnificent scenery seen from the famed Dufferin Terrace, including the village of Beauport and St. Joseph, the town of Levis, and the Island of Orleans, also the whole harbour of Quebec, and Montmorency Falls in the distance It intended to connect the Lower Town with the hotel by means of an elevator.

The <building>Academy of Music Quebec</building>has lately undergone a thorough overhauling, including a very considerable enlargement of the stage, new scenery, new dressing rooms and green room in basement, a graded floor in the auditorium, and new opera chairs of the best make, the whole tending to a vast improvement upon the original building Mr. <person>W E. Russell</person>, the present proprietor, intends having the Academy open all the year round, and so remove the standing reproach of Quebec, that it has no place of amusement. A hearty endorsement of this enterprising spirit on the part of the public, is now in order.

<article title="Correspondence - Montreal" author="">MONTREAL 



(Correspondence of the CANADIAN ARCHITECT AND BUILDER.)



THE prospects for a busy building trade in our city are brightening, and ere the present season closes we expect to have commenced several

important buildings amongst others the following The <building>Y. M. C. A. on Dominion Square Montreal</building>, the <building>Victoria hospital MOntreal</building>at the head of University street (the gift to the city of <person>Sir Donald A. Smith</person> and <person>Sir George Stephen</person>); the new <building>Science School for McGill University</building>, (the gift of the late <person>James Workman</person>), <building>the Sun Life building Montreal </building>on Notre Dame Street and a large mansion on upper Peel street for <person>Duncan McIntyre</person>. estimated to cost half a million, and only yesterday was added to this a magnificent gift to McGill University by Mr. <person>W. C. McDonald</person>, of about half a million dollars which includes two buildings which he has agreed to erect for the college, one to be the "<building>McDonald Technical Building Montreal</building>," and the other the

<building>McDonald Physics Building MOntreal</building>." All Mr. McDonald asks the Governors of the University to do is to provide a site and approve of the plans—the rest he undertakes himself. It is estimated that the two buildings with their equipments will cost about three hundred thousand dollars. McGill college will be thus placed in a position equal to the best on the continent, and with the new means at its disposal will be able to adapt the faculty to the immediate demands of the hour by establishing chairs of electrical and mechanical engineering, etc. Besides these, Sir <person>Donald A. Smith </person>has bought the residence of the late <person>Thomas Workman </person>which occupies a position on the College grounds, and which he purposes altering and adapting for use by the Donalda Department for lady students.

During the last month permits have been taken out for some ten or twelve buildings, ranging from two to six thousand dollars a piece.

REAL ESTATE.



Real estate during the past month has been active, building lots in the west end being in specially good demand It is almost impossible to buy choice lots in the city to-day, but there is plenty of land available in the vicinity of Montreal, the only drawback being the transit facilities As soon as some system of rapid transportation is put into effect, which must of necessity soon be, farm properties in the neighborhood of Montreal -will attract the attention of investors, speculators and home seekers. During the month of February the sale transfers in Montreal and Cote St. Antoine amounted to $571,995.54, which is about $22,000 more than the corresponding month of last year.

<assoc>CANADIAN SOCIETY OF CIVIL ENGINEERS</assoc>.



The Canadian Society of Civil Engineers have leased club rooms over the west end branch of the <building>Bank of Montreal</building>, on the corner of St. Catherine and Mansfield streets, and expect to move into them on the 1st of May.

FLOOD PROTECTION.



I learn that <person>Mr. Keefer </person>has arrived in the city to watch the action of the ice in breaking up, he having been appointed by the Government to report to them on the feasibility of plan No, 6.

NEW BRIDGE.



I learn a charter has been granted to a local company for the construction of a bridge from Montreal to Longueil. The charter I understand has certain restrictions which will have to be overcome before any work is commenced, such as satisfying the City Council, the Harbor Commissioners, the Board of Trade, etc , etc. No doubt some better means of communication between the two shores of the St Lawrence at this point is wanted, but whether it should be in the form of a bridge as proposed or some such scheme as the Shearer scheme, is a question upon which engineers, like doctors, differ To my mind the Shearer scheme, with certain modifications, would be the most practical scheme yet presented for either connecting both shores of the river, for harbor improvements or flood protection.
