THE movement for a Dominion organization of Canadian Master Plumbers is still being pushed forward, the Montreal and Ottawa local associations being the prime movers. The plumbers throughout Ontario and the maritime provinces have been invited to consider the question, and an effort will be made to hold a preliminary meeting for organization in the near future. The Montreal association at least appear to be desirous that the proposed Canadian Association should affiliate with the National Plumbers' Association of the United States. To what extent this feeling is shared by the local associations in Toronto, St. John, and elsewhere, has not been learned.



REFERRING to the article on another page concerning tests of fire-proofing material made recently at Deseronto, somewhat similar tests took place recently in Boston of several kinds of wood which had been rendered fire-proof by the injection of fire-proofing compounds. The process consists of forcing by hydraulic pressure a chemical solution into the substance of the wood or other material. A structure built of wood thus chemically prepared was blackened and carbonized to a depth of one-half or three-quarters of an inch, but otherwise remained unimpaired under the action of heat so intense as to melt the window glass. There appears to be no doubt that wood thus prepared will resist the action of fire, but the fact that its preparation costs from twenty-five to thirty dollars per thousand feet, is sufficient to prevent the process from coming largely into use. Porous terra cotta, on the other hand, is not only equally capable of resisting fire, but is likewise very moderate in cost, and has other properties which commend its use in building construction even where it is not required as a fire-proof material.



THE collapse of several large buildings in New York city recently, resulting in the killing of a number of persons, has drawn public attention to the necessity for the proper education of architects. In the case of one of the buildings referred to, a tenement house on Orchard Street, the jury found the owner, the contractor and the building inspector to be criminally negligent in having used and allowed inferior material and workmanship. The plans also were found to be seriously defective, brick piers in the basement being loaded to the extent of ninety tons to the square foot, while the limit allowed by law was but eight tons to the foot. The architect of the building was practically unknown in the profession. The jury who investigated the circumstances in connection with the collapse of the building close their report as follows: "The most efficient check which could be placed upon practices of the kind which have led to this disaster, would be the licensing of all architects, who should be required to undergo a thorough examination as to their qualifications to practise an art upon which the lives of so many people depend." Legislation of this character the <assoc>Ontario Association of Architects </assoc>have been endeavoring for several years past to have placed on the statute books of the Province of Ontario, and it is to be hoped that their petition will be granted before disasters similar to those which have occurred in New York shall be witnessed in this country.
