<article title=" HEATING FRUIT CARS BY ICE.

" author="">HEATING FRUIT CARS BY ICE.

An interesting application of science by thc practical man has developed recently, in the care of fruit en roule from the south to the northern markets. The fruit train is very likely to meet a cold wave on the way and, if the temperature goes below a certain point, its freight will he ruined. It is said that this misfortune is prevented by turning hose on the cars and coating them with ice. The impenetrable coat of armour thus produced is considered to effectively blanket the car and prevent the radiation of heat. But

there is probably more in it than this. The formation of ice is attended by a great giving out of latent heat from the water in process of freezing., This phenomenon, which is held by some to account for our Indian Summer as being consequent upon the sudden communication of heat to our atmosphere by the first freezing of the great lakes to the northâ€”ought to account for some of the advantage to the fruit. Not only does the ice act as a protective coating against cold, but, in its formation, there must be an actual communication of heat.
