A recent coldwater paint calls for wet casein or milk curd, which is mixed with any suitable mineral base, dried, and ground to powder. Some of the product is mixed with slaked lime and glue in the presence of water. This is then dried and ground to powder. The two main compositions are then mixed, the white and the colored pigment added, and the whole is diluted with water to a working consistency. The material is claimed to be waterproof, not to act upon the brushes, and may be diluted as required and always gives a uniform appearance, even if the entire surface is not treated at the same time.

It is said that the addition or even so small a proporotion as one-tenth of as much brick dust as sand to ordinary mortars is preventative of the disintegration so often characterizing mortars used in the masonry of public works; the use of such dust mixed with lime and sand is said to be generally and successfully practiced in the Spanish dorninions, and is stated to be, in all essential points, superior to some of the best imported hydraulic cements for the construction of culverts, drains, tanks or cisterns, and even for roofs, whether for setting flat tiles or for making the usual flat tropical roof.â€”Exchange.
